[118047915808110525370,100837902308913053179,I called them to take advantage of the Cash for Clunkers $3500 trade in towards a lease. I needed something newer and that got better gas mileage. I got preapproved on their website and got a call from salesrep Jheni. She told me I could come in that night and get a car. She told me in advance she had another customer at the same time. I got there and sat for a while. FInally we discussed the car and I test drove it. She collected my info and I took delivery of the car. It was late at night, so I didn't get a walkthrough and I wasn't shown the features as I'm sure they show other new owners. I didn't mind as I wanted to get home and I'm sure the rest of the dealership did too. One thing I didn't like was the delivery of the car. At Roush Honda they have the car ready for you in a brightly lit garage and you get to look over the car and get shown the features. Hopefully Lindsay will get a garage place/space to do that. Other than that it was an ok experience. I would have given it 5 stars if the process would have gone faster. Especially since I was pre qualified, and knew exactly the car and color I wanted. The sales person Jheni was very nice the whole time. One other thing, I was a little put off listening to another salesperson try to close a sale. They started to put down another car maker and then the manager came over and did the same thing. Why put down another maker especially when that vehicle has gotten rave reviews in all the car mags and car websites I read. It just sounded desperate and I would have walked out just like the other people did.]
