[106264141367764701954,100858358520076282477,The Camino Real makes a person feel like dressing up,and as if they lived in the elegant time.After arriving on the Amtrak train(which in it's self is class act)you feel there is no other parts of the city you need to see or any other places to be.I like the view from the 16th floor at night.Iam the type of man that thinks every day's a holiday and every meal's a banquet so there will be no nambie bambie, nit picking from me.the place is 100 years young and still has a dance or two left in her,I be to thinking.If you like your arraingments top drawer without losing sight of a period in time when people came to El Paso to experience the rough and tumble west and not sleep in the sand.enconsed in elegance I was happy to pay the dignfied gentry, of a bygone era that went the way of the buffalo and when men were men and women were happier for it.]
