[112870907898832744023,100049129176396049458,One of my sons made a purchase from here and it was handled well. The store often has ammunition even when others do not. They have a good assortment of items. It is not laid out like a department store but it is a nice "hole in the wall" place to find and add to your list of possible suppliers.]
