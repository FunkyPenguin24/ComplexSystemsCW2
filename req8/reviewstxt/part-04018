[115298046644165025279,100370406690522231191,This place is such a scam! They lure you in with promises of cheap prices, but my husband and I ended up paying twice what we normally would have paid at our regular doctor. Not to mention, they seem to pressure you into paying extra for part of the exam that should come standard (the glaucoma test). They also told me that my lenses would be too thick for the glasses that were cheapest, so I ended up paying $300 for the stupid things, just to get the stupid free eye exam. I hate this place and will never go back.]
