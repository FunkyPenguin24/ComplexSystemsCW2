[105544860104409941771,100715345542624346273,We dined there last Thursday evening and the place was very popular. I had the seafood Pasta Olio and Barbs had her usual salmon cutlets. I thought the seafood pasta was brilliant with just the right balance of pasta, oil and sea food. The octopus and scallops were perfectly cooked - mine host Leo was very attentive dividing his time between the customers, cash register and new grandson who was there with his daughter and son in law at the next table - we got introduced!]
