[102668638680100600979,100643512323302319838,I had a fantastic experience with China Wok. They took my order over the phone, for pick-up. They said 7-10 minutes, I got there in 8. My food was packed and ready. I ordered the garlic broccoli and the hot and sour soup (full order). The garlic broccoli was perfectly cooked and still had a wonderful texture, not mushy. The hot and sour soup could have been slightly hotter temperature wise, so i just hotted it up in a soup pot, it was well balanced in flavor. Most of all, the rice was light and fluffy, not sticky and pasted into a container. Bonus points, not one styrofoam container, super turnoff when they pop up. tip: if you are ordering at any restaurant between 11am and 1pm, or 5pm and 8pm, be prepared to wait, be prepared to have super busy people, trying very hard to help you and everyone else in the restaurant which is undoubtably full. have some consideration, just as you wish someone would do for you at your job when things are crazy and you just want to eat a cookie instead.]
