[103110274212785727265,100317789892124210673,My wife, child and I lived here for a year and that's only because we were stuck in our lease. This place is horrible. Our key cards never worked correctly to the pathetic gym, the pool remained locked for weeks after it was supposed to open, the gas fireplace has never worked, we had 2 major repairs that were not caused by us, and we had several items stolen from cars and also a rusty old bike that was locked up. I do not suggest it for any reason.]
