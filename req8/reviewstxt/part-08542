[111491895736053626926,100615554217698647134,Called salesmen about listed truck and described my need for a clean rust free truck( I live in a very snowy climate where they salt the roads heavily). Salesman went out of his way to take pictures and start truck while on phone to verify condition. In pictures truck showed minimal surface rust on some front suspension. Question condition with salesmen and was reassured again that it was a great truck that had been serviced and thoroughly check out and I would be happy with the condition. When questioned on records for servicing they seemed to be misplaced but the oil had been changed for sure I was reassured again. I then got a bank loan and drove 2 hrs and flew 5 hrs then rented a hotel room for the night. Following morning I was graciously picked up at my motel for the sort ride to the small car lot. The truck was set aside as promised, but battery was dead and had to be jumped and brakes were locking up (probably rusty from not being driven?) and large wet spot on rear axle housing near plug( maybe from having fluid checked or stripped treads?) Worst part as feared this truck was well used and frame rust had been painted over(at some point?) and was flaking off when poked. This truck was in decent condition exterior and interior and motor and transmission seemed great, but as I questioned and feared the rust was extensive and far more than a close inspection should have disclosed. Dealer honestly, could have saved me $500+ in expenses and the dealers wasted time picking me up and returning me to the airport to rent a car to drive home. Called car lot owner to request reimbursement for rental car home, was unable to ask or explain and was hung up on! DON'T TRAVEL FROM AFAR TO PURCHASE!]
