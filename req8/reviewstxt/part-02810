[111723554502677608850,100303594229543778555,My wife has been going to this dentist for about a year now and has really liked the service. They have always been very gentle when cleaning her teeth and are personable people. My wife scheduled her last visit because she chipped her tooth and wanted to try and take care of it before the Christmas holidays. So she made an appointment and had the tooth repaired and all was well. She asked how much she owed and they told her it was covered, that she didn't owe anything. A few days ago we received a bill in the mail that charged us for an emergency appointment. They claim that their policy is if you schedule an appointment outside of the standard 2 checkups per year it is considered an emergency. They didn't mention anything about this being an emergency appointment over the phone when my wife scheduled this, they just slapped on a $75 fee because they want to. I was very disappointed when we talked to them about this issue and they acted like they didn't care, they said it was just their policy. Needless to say we will be finding another dentist that doesn't tack on hidden fees.]
