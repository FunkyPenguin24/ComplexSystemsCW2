[115703044862094110982,100701022704627683412,Teeth cleaning Wednesday at Family Dentist Tree along with bite wing x-rays and fluoride. Everything went smoothly. One thing I hope they change is notifications that your normal doctor is away on vaca. I was notified on Monday that Dr. Stroop was away on vaca and I'll be seen by another Dr. Let me know this a couple weeks in advance or when Dr. Stroop puts in for vacation so I can reschedule. 2 days in advance doesn't leave many openings to be had to try and reschedule. I'm not taking anything away from the doctor that did see me though. He was kind and got to the point. Overall, I will and I have recommended Family Dentist Tree to many others.]
