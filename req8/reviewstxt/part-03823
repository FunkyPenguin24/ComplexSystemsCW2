[106443162003560428476,100359882066160427917,The best steak in Leeds! With kids now we don't get to eat out as much as we did. On the rare occasion we do get a babysitter we always find ourselves gravitating to La Grillade on Wellington Street beneath the old Wellesley Hotel. This is traditional, fine French dining at its best and I challenge anyone to find a better steak in Leeds, even at one of the new fancy Brazillian or Argentinian places that have recently opened up. Great wine, great menu (boudin noir starter is epic) and nice friendly buzz/atmosp[here. If its a special occasion, try the chateuabriand - you won't be disappointed. I can also safely say you won't find a better cheese board in Leeds either!]
