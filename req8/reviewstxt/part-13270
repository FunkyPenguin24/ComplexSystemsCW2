[110698734548112690795,100872805752462151927,The team there is so friendly and make you feel comfortable. I got laser hair removal and was slightly nervous about the pain and outcome but they tell you everything you want to know. They also try to work with you if you are thinking about getting multiple areas done. I never had to wait long and they try very hard to fit your appointments in at a time best for you. I am definitely planning to go back soon and have suggested to friends to check them out.]
