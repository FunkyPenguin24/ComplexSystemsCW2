[101867861142437040172,101128057257814410734,OK, I am shocked to see a bad review here. I am a business traveler and can stay anywhere I choose, there are more expensive "higher end" hotels around for sure, but the mix of clean, courteous, convenient and comfortable are just right at the HI Marketplace, I stay there every time I get a chance, have even brought my family there. Last week I conducted a team meeting there, my team was not sure about it, but ended up raving about this place in the end...you can walk to food shopping etc...excellent hotel excellent staff...when they make a mistake they go overboard to fix it.]
