[100722904704318194627,100909306987317716834,I went for lunch once. It was cool. Tonight.... Man that place was dirty and obviously understaffed. The only thing good was the cook. I hoped the bartender knew a little something. So wrong. Tonight pretty much sealed it's fate with me. I won't be going back and I will travel to the one on I-10 from now on. Cooks.... Great job. The rest..... Pish!!!!!]
