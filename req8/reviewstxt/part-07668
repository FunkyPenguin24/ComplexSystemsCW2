[106725195127025324396,100569021394153548497,This school boast serving children ages 2-12 but they only focus on ages 2-5. They have some great elementary teachers but dealing with the politics and the "gossip" over shadows what they can do. I considered the school because I was told about the director who was big on diversity but when I arrived diverse it was not. One parent described it as the country club only members. There was no sense of inclusion and it seemed that they lived in a world all their own. A friend recently took her child out and the child struggled with adapting to the lessons of "regular" school. For 20K, you expect so much more. I will use my money at some of the better schools in the area.]
