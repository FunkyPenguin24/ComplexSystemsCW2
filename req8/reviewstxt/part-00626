[103887534216272470837,100192294048086994995,The delivery man that I have in my neighborhood makes no attempt to contact you. Due to work constraints, I missed him twice, but was available ALL DAY TODAY. He left an info notice on the door but never bothered to buzz my door or knock or anything. I was here the whole day. The customer service rep from the 1800# can vouch that I waited, and also said it was possible for a reschedule. She sent a message to this location and they called me. The man on the phone was extremely rude, made it seem entirely my fault, made no apologies, and said basically I can pick it up or itll be returned to the shipper. This location is not only out of the way, but it is not in a very reputable neighborhood. It's ridiculous that I paid an extra 7 dollars for my delivery, and will now have to pay more to get here. If the people inside the building tomorrow are as nice as the man I spoke to on the phone, they will not know what him them. I'm so upset I could cry. I already made a complaint to the shipper that they should no longer use UPS service, as Fed Ex has always made every effort to arrive in a timely manner, and when they cannot reach me, they send the package to my local USPS facility. And I'm utterly appalled that you can't change your delivery date without paying an extra 7$. Awful. And this is supposed to be more convenient than in-store shopping.]
