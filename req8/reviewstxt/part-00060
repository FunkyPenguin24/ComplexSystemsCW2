[114044283434975174559,100161942481193378719,We first visited First Redeemer because we were looking for two things - 1) a contemporary service 2) a strong student ministry. My best friend attended there and suggested that we visit one Sunday with her family. We connected quickly with Jeff Jackson (who was the assistant pastor at that time) who ultimately prayed with our son for salvation a few months later. It was not long before we became active in a Sunday school class and our son became very involved in the student ministry. Last year we joined the church and our entire family was baptized together last summer by Pastor Jackson. We love the staff and the message (God loves you and wants you to know him) and we look forward to getting up on Sunday to be there!]
