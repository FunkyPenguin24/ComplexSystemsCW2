[107489961180792672195,100790913112939675612,I went in today with my Sister looking for a couple of movies, Robert was the CSR, and though he was VERY friendly with my sister, he was very very rude with me. He introduced himself to my sister, shook her hand, and went to introduce himself to me, this is what he did, he held his hand out to me, and said, "Hi I'm- Yeah, I don't care," and pulled his hand away from me. For the next few minuets we walked around, and everytime I would say something, he would come back and say, "Yeah, I don't care," and when I started to get upset and walk off, he wants to say, "I'm just kidding with you Ma'am," I'm sorry, but you do not treat paying customers this way. All in all, he was extremly rude, and as long as he is STILL working there, I WILL NOT be returning. If you like being treated like scum, be my guest go in and ask for this guy, I promise you, he will make you feel lower then dirt. The other employees here were very sweet and very helpful, but this guy, made my visit upsetting and make me want to never set foot in this store ever again.]
