[112126038360942741424,100217202710297224578,Brazos Valley Services is very good about reminding me about checkups for both A/C and Heating. Brad was the technician this checkup and he arrived on-time, was friendly and professional. He checked the thermostats and furnaces. He informed me of a possible issue with the drainage of condensation from the A/C units which I appreciated. He checked the units outside also. I have always had good service from Brazos Valley Services and this time was no exception. Well done! Thanks]
