[100794429178286355318,101043842323121363955,So GOOD. I always had food at the Reseda location but then moved to Culver City. This is your best bet for a hearty soulful pho soup and/or grilled lemongrass dishes. Also, the egg rolls are different and better then other Vietnamese places I've gone to. Definitely good for lunch or dinner if you're in the area.]
