[112032898073116550044,100583145255914622473,This place is AWESOME. Their tea selection is almost ridiculous. They're open late, which is great, and free wifi, I like to go here and do work and chill. They have these awesome sitting rooms, my friends and I have gone there and had our own private room and all hung out. Owner is really nice and so are the baristas :)]
