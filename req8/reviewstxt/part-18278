[107885716405513563585,101144207226978564467,My son has been attending daily meetings at Grace Community Center at Grace Baptist Church for a number of years. Their community outreach- minded programs are truly a blessing to the homeless, unemployed and disabled citizens of San Jose and to the entire population of this city. The administrators and their staff are outstanding individuals who truly understand the great need for the services, free meals and friendly gatherings that happen regularly because of the enlightened and caring leaders of this city. My sincere thanks to everyone involved in this truly Christian and humane endeavor. Bob Lewis]
