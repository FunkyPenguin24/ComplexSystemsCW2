[108191363686163993347,100718841490080448372,I shifted to Auckland three years ago, after trying about five hairdressers in central Auckland I came across Corporate Mens Haircuts. After one visit I was hocked and been back every four weeks since. I now wouldn't go anywhere else. They do a great job and their attention to detail is top notch. Great location and always clean and tidy. - If you are looking for a quality barbershop, look no further.]
