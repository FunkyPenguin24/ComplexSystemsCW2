[102488244805744885165,100923744797859172709,I recently visited New Orleans and wanted to get out and see some of the local flora and fauna in person. New Orleans Kayak Swamp Tour provided that and much more. Jeff was very knowledgeable and took me on an amazing tour. Not only did I get to see a lot of wildlife, but the scenery was beautiful. I would highly recommend them.]
