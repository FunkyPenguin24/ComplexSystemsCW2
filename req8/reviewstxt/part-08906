[108721506235974703995,100633664314924701249,AMAZING experience from the very beginning. I was told by other "LASIK" centers that I was not a candidate because my corneas were too thin and prescription was too high (-8.50). Other doctors never offered alternatives, but when I went to see Dr. Cutarelli, he assured me that I was a candidate for PRK. His staff at both locations were very pleasant and made me feel right at home. On surgery day, I couldn't have been happier with the overall experience. I was very relaxed and Dr. Cutarelli and his staff were very thorough in explaining what I could expect during and post-surgery. Now a year later, I've had a few post-surgery visits and the staff and Dr. Cutarelli are just as pleasant as the day I met them. Thanks to them, I can wake up and not have to worry about wearing contacts or glasses!]
