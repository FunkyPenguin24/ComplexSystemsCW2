[111226737276535822984,100009855248686852574,I just moved to Cambridge, and a friend and I were looking for a place to hang out Friday night. Point Break was great! The bartender was extremely nice, and kept drinks coming all night. He let us sample a few different drinks without charging us for them. The other people at the bar were nice as well. We had a few too many (as happens when you're having a great time), and the bartender actually arranged for someone to drive us (and my car) home instead of us having to take a cab and collect my car the following morning. I cannot recommend Point Break highly enough!]
