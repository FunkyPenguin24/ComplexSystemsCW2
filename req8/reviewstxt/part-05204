[103684056639612909144,100435257058383719270,My husband Bill and I have been patients of Dr. Pam's for more than 20 years. We love Dr. Pam and Dr. Stella! (Sorry - I've never met the third partner - I'm sure she's wonderful too!) We started when I worked downtown and could get there easily. After trying other dentists "up the hill" I think it says everything that we choose to drive almost 60 miles round trip to keep coming. And not just for ourselves - we do separate trips for each of our kids. We love you guys!]
