[100265779030890914666,100276746858524401835,I had been looking for a vehicle to replace the sedan I owned for years and was looking for something more along the lines of a pickup or SUV. I saw this 2000 Chevy with just about 90,000 miles on it, came over, and test drove it. Scott, the salesman, got us through the process quickly and Peter in financing is a pleasure to work with. When I have to replace the pickup, I'll look here first thing.]
