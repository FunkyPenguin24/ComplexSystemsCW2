[114549048684717058099,100205028331871651829,I just wanted to comment on the fantastic service received from your staff this week at Castle Hill Holden. Both the staff over the phone as well as Bob Crnovic were informative, helpful and willing to go above and beyond to make things happen. Bob was an impeccable salesman â€“ he was able to promote all the features of the vehicle and build rapport very easily with the decision makers involved in the sale, without being overly pushy. He asked quality questions to identify our buying needs and goals and really listened. Even when there were a few objections, Bob was able to handle them with ease and able to provide simple solutions. I find this a very rare quality. We made the decision within 20 minutes and were able to sort out all the paperwork and receive the vehicle within 24 hours. I would highly recommend visiting this branch if you are wanting to purchase a Holden. I am very happy with my vehicle and so far the post sales service has been just as good as the pre sales service. Thank you Castle Hill Holden staff!!!!]
