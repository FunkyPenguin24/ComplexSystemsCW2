[100257918259393677430,100097955579663166347,Requested an oil change which was told to me over the phone to be $37 not including a $10 sale bringing it to 27. I arrive and they requote me 10% instead of $10. I agree anyways and left my phone number (in case something else was wrong) and my car there and went back to work. After work i arrived to a bill of $119 and a mechanic telling me "The things were broken, and needed replacing". He claimed to try to call but didnt get ahold of me because he did not write down my phone number right. I asked, and literally he said that it made sense to do the work anyways even as i had clearly stated call for conformation before doing anything. They wiped the labor fee, and he tried fiddling with numbers to screw me out of more money, he said he'd take another 20% off. I noticed he never took the original 10% off which he had quoted. At this point he was fumbling for answers and seemed to be making things up as he went to why things happend as they were. Absolutely avoid this place. It is not worth it, go to any other local oil change spot.]
