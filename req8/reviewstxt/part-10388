[114903365107829888425,100714482116387124475,We go there a few times a month for a beer and a sandwich. Good food and nice selection of beers and ales. Wine prices are reasonable as well. Last night we had a pizza. (Mondays 1/2 price night) Sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I think it's my new favorite pizza. Thin crust, perfectly baked, fresh ingredients (at least they tasted like it, but since I didn't make the pie I don't know for sure) and perfectly seasoned. Everyone has a different taste in pizza, but this one is a home run in my book.]
