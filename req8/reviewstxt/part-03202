[112050552666505462405,100323634759126194692,I have waited for twelve years to buy a new car because I was scared and suspicious of car dealers and salespersons. Eventually I had to do it; I prayed and entered the Toyota dealership in Watertown. The friendly atmosphere of Toyota of Watertown and the outstanding service I received from Felix Rodriguez have pleasantly impressed me and convinced me that I should recommend this dealership to my friends. I, myself, am planning to return in about five years for a new car.]
