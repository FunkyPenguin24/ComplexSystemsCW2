[101973601571260860171,100516654891911195810,Wow, I am really suprised on all the bad reviews, but again I think repairs always make people mad. I bought my Nissan Sentra here in 2007 and have had absolutely no problems at all with them. They have a loyalty program which helps with the costs of service and everything. I took my niece here to get her new car and the service has been excellent. I just called them now for my 90,000 mile checkup and they hooked me up with a loaner car which means no Avis for the road trip. Anyway, I give them very high marks and I have nothing at all to gain by praising them. just my 2 cents.]
