[116369470095178416098,100377409943287653841,This restaurant was awesome. The hibachi grill was one of the most entertaining things that I've done in rapid City. The lunch prices are significantly better than the dinner prices but it is worth it either way. Their sushi is absolutely wonderful. The chefs will also take their energy from the people at their grill. If the people are your table are energetic and participating then it will be a great show. If most of the people are not interested or seem put off then they will just cook and leave.]
