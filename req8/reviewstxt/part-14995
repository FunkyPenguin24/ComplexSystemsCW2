[114339511632509707418,100966686199119205668,My wife and I travel fairly often and are more than happy with the treatment both of our dogs receive at Holiday Kennels. By the time we are dropping them off the dogs are no longer paying attention to us and are excited to be somewhere they can socialize. They do an excellent job in grooming, they love animals, and the pricing is up front and fair. I have nothing but great things to say about this kennel and recommend to all of my friends when they ask for a place to board their animals.]
