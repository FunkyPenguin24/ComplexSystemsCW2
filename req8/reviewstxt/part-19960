This little gem of a eat-in or take away Thai cuisine is a very refreshing change from the routine "fusion cuisine" you don't expect to find a hidden away lunch or dinner eatery. Great food, great variety, great prices and very friendly staff. And of course, all the food is freshly made with a little hint of family recipe I was told, no additives / no preservatives / gluten-free. Long live independent businesses! Hint: if unsure what to order, ask for a recommendation! Also, try the home-made ginger sauce. Yum!]
