[100783557115000599970,100942334112123563801,I've been seeing Rosalee for a couple of years now. She used to be at the Staples Mill location but has since moved to Carytown. The location is super convenient for me and the service is always wonderful. They are quick to answer the phone, book appointments and always greet customers. Rosalee gives a great cut and is fun to talk to. I usually get a nice moisturizing treatment for my extra-dry / tangly hair and I love that her haircuts grow out nicely too. They also have lots of great products available including the super awesome It's a 10 line.]
