[101701393858778028924,100044223577885737711,A large & friendly crew made me feel very confident. They seemed very organized and were having fun getting ready. I was excited waiting while they made final wind tests and assembled the craft. Once I climbed on and we began to gently and slowly lift off the ground I felt very calm and the whole experience was beautiful and quiet. It's hard to describe exactly the amazing time I had. Our pilot, Capt. Bruce, was friendly and answered our questions and he seemed to be completely happy doing what he was doing. I recommend this company and beautiful experience. Cross this off your bucket list! I'm hooked and would definitely go again.]
