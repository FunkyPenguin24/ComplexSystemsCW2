[103713948013935143330,100924261429875088894,See Chris Phillips and the team at AutoNation Ford Burleson!.. Period. Absolutely the best dealership I have dealt with in many years. I've purchased many new vehicles in my life and can be a sales person's worse nightmare as I work in sales as well. I left with everything I wanted and everyone involved was a winner. JP in finance is one of the best financial people you will find out there and everything is exactly as you see it with him. I would drive down to see them regardless of where I lived in the DFW area. Thanks to the entire team!]
