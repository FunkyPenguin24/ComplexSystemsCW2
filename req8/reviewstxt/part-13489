[100292195553195295321,100884560956732199309,I've always had a great experience with Ashley Furniture, from the sales team to the delivery, everything went smoothly. My salesman was very courteous, patiently followed me around the store several times helping me find what I wanted to buy, and didn't pressure me to buy way more than I needed to. The Delivery went just as well, again both men were very courteous, and help me move out some old furniture, and me arrange the new furniture the way I wanted it. I highly recommend Ashley, and will continue to buy from them in the future.]
