[102085737601792182930,100256588532495480210,Even for a party of 16, the food arrived promptly and was fantastic. I tend to eat large meals and wasn't disappointed with the portion size. 3 courses and two drinks came to around Â£30, but you could eat here for under half that if you didn't pig out! I'll definitely be coming back.]
