[106066993172912375327,100852236541969588149,This was an amazing rental cabin!! We rented it for the weekend so we could have our first vacation as a blended family. I have to say, AWESOME!! The cabin was clean, beautiful, spacious, and very well supplied. It was a home away from home. Our 14 yr old daughter even said "You can tell someone loves this cabin by how warm and inviting it is." Thank you Clear Sky Ridge for the awesome space and generous cabin. We will be back!]
