[114659122821248395749,100876616848899363376,My husband and I were looking for a vehicle that has high fuel efficiency. The 2013 Chevy Spark stood out among all the choices because of its affordable price, stylish appearance, and of course its mpg ratings. When it comes to car shopping, we never rush to make a decision since a large amount of money is involved. After visiting two other Chevy dealerships in the DFW metroplex, we decided to make a stop at Young Chevrolet after knowing that they have a variety of Sparks in their inventory. My husband and I both test drove a 2013 Spark 1LT in Denim (love the color!) and we agreed that it was the right car for us. Our sales representative Pablo Miramontes and his manager Dennis Steele did their best to work with us on the price, and guess what, we now have a brand new car to cruise around town! Oh, and the Finance Manager Bob Tyndall was also very friendly and helping in getting us set up with a low interest monthly payment plan. It has been almost a month since we purchased the Spark and we really enjoy all the features this little car is packed with, especially the MyLink touchscreen radio! We also really appreciate the after-sale customer services and follow-up e-mails/calls provided by various staff members at Young Chevrolet to ensure that we are satisfied with the vehicle. Buying the Spark from Young Chevrolet is certainly the most stress-free car shopping experience we've had in a while and I strongly recommend anyone who's looking for a car to stop by Young Chevrolet. You won't be disappointed!]
