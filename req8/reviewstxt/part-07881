[100363280889126222784,100581299320596675163,If you are looking for a good place to take your animals in Spokane, I recommend the North Division Animal Medical Center. I have a cat that seemed to be having some abdominal problems. I was looking for a new place as the last place I went to was so expensive, plus they made me feel bad that I didn't get all their latest treatments and care plans. I actually called another place first that was recommended by a neighbor, but they didn't take walk-ins and were booked for a few days. That place recommended NDAMC. I called them about 7:45 AM and got an 11:00 appointment, but was also encouraged to come in at any time to see if we could get squeezed in. After I made the appointment, I read the reviews here and felt more than a little concerned. However, I decided to go ahead with the initial exam. Dr. Sipert and his technician Chrissy were awesome, as were the front desk staff. I felt like I was treated with respect and the prices were reasonable. They also didn't pressure me to have a bunch of tests taken, but offered quotes on things in priority order. I've been to other places here in Spokane and never felt completely comfortable as a pet owner and often faced sticker shock. When I found out that nothing was urgently wrong with my cat, I decided not to go forward with the tests and take her home for further observation, and my decision was respected. I purchased the flea treatment and got some recommendations for environmental pest treatments that I could buy over the counter. Finally, when I remarked about the good service on Facebook, one of my friends told me this is where she and her parents take their pets, as well as have them boarded. She also had nothing but good to say about this clinic. I'll be returning here whenever I need care for my cats.]
