[103009847319164845854,100522589666131974343,Yesterday I purchased my 6th vehicle from this dealership. I couldn t have been more pleased with my experience. Every person was knowledgeable, friendly, super helpful & eager to answer my questions. I test drove 3 cars with Leo. He was patient with me & explained the different trim lines. I chose a Prius Persona and next met with Carlos Sunsin. Carlos & I worked out the financing, price, options, etc. Now off to the paperwork with Holly Lambert. Holly explained every piece of paper I was signing & went beyond to point out some coverages I wasn t aware I had. I am very impressed with these three young people. Professional & courteous beyond compare. Lastly, I took delivery of my car. The trade in was parked next to the new car making the transfer of personal items easy. Before I drove away, I was congratulated by General Manager Paul Kramer. Paul always remembers my name, asks about my daughter and is a delight. I am loyal to this dealership because they have earned my loyalty! Check them out.]
