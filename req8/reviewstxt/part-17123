[106873782728895910433,101082798643290338906,I've been going to this office for about a year here's my experience: The dentist are great, but I've had 2 appointments canceled for whatever reason, and 2 appointments accidentally scheduled for the wrong time. I needed an emergency appointment and found that emergencies have no priority over a regular appointment. If it weren't from my experience with the dentist, I would be looking for a new dental provider]
