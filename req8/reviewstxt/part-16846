[109637395048319907299,101065752701512060645,The server should have mentioned the price of the seafood special. For $28 you got 2 pieces of tough lobster, no shrimp, and no taste to speak of. Oh, and no bread with an entr√©e that expensive ? The burger might have been better with fresh meat, but the fries were decent but no pickle. Overall, really bad. When this happened at Iron Hill I got a gift card in the amount of the bill, but when I emailed, no response. No way I'd ever refer anyone to this place.]
