[101277029176985318393,100224598231112920422,I first say Dr Ornoff when I found a practice that would accept my dental plan. I had was long overdue for an exam and a crown for a root canal done years earlier. He was attentive, friendly and answered all my frequent questions. He did not scold, but did recommend more frequent visits (duh!). After the cleaning, he fitted me for my crown and installed a temporary crown. While the temporary crown did not stay attached, a call to Dr Ornoff assured me that all was ok and that no damage would be done by simply waiting for my permanent crown. I've had that crown for 4 years now, no problems, better quality of life and worth every penny of co-pay. The office staff was never pushy about payments, but they did keep me advised of what was expected prior to receiving services - no surprises. All in all it was a good experience, No pain, everything explained, no surprises and great outcome for reasonable price.]
