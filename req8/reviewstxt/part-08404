[108756335359836530797,100609217341556600192,I rented a house through Coldwell Banker recently and had to wait 2+ months to get the security deposit refund. After the first month of waiting I called the office and they told me it would be mailed in a day or two. After another week I began calling a few times per day and was transferred to the property management department each time with no answer. I left multiple messages and none of my calls were returned for over a week, yet I knew that he was at the office because each day they told me he was there. Finally got an answer and was told that my check would be mailed in another day or two. After waiting another week, I began calling daily again. A few days later I was told that my check was ready and I ended up having to drive down there and pick up the check. Ridiculous. I will never do any form of business with Coldwell Banker again. Maybe my money isn't too important to a company their size, but nearly $1000 is a big deal to me.]
