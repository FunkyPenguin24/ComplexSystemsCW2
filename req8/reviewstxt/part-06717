[109009339335765108389,100517665708205071566,Popped in for a Friday lunch with friends and was really impressed by the freshness of the salads and the bold flavours. Despite being super busy, our food arrived quickly. The fresh spring rolls were light and full of flavour, they just need a little more of their hero ingredient, the duck. The standout dish was the poached chicken salad in a coconut dressing - crisp salad, not swamped by dressing. The green papaya salad was crunchy, sour and delicious. If you need to wait for a table, they turn over quickly. They looked to be doing a brisk trade in takeaway lunches too.]
