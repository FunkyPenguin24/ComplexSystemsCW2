[109201741111359007083,101035539830123782879,I started taking classes at PoleWorx Jan. 2012. I had purchased a $20 Groupon for 1 month of unlimited classes and tanning. I then signed up for the 6 month membership at $40/month. It is well worth it. I look back at pictures & videos 6 months ago from pole class and compare them to the current ones and I cannot believe all the stuff I can do and how good I've become. It's hard to believe it's me! I love PoleWorx! All of the instructions are AMAZING! They are comforting and welcoming. Natalie, the owner is very friendly and genuine. Taking pole classes, which is a challenge, and Paige's chair dance classes has really built up my self-confidence and having tons of fun while doing it. PoleWorx is also a great way to find new friends. I have become close with instructor Von, and many people that attend her classes. I would highly suggest to every girl out there looking for something new, fun, and exciting to come by. There is a class for everyone! Pole, Chair, Zumba, Yoga/Pilates, & Booty Boot Camp. No matter what age, shape, or size you'll have a blast in all. Remember to keep an open mind and let your inner girl out!]
