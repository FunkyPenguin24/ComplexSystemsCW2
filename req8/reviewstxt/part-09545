[104427802079930080030,100668441398496933356,We found Rose City Dental for an emergency visit on Saturday. I called many other dentists and none were as responsive, available or helpful as Rose City Dental. We got an appointment immediately and were seen moments after arrival. Dr Lee was patient and comforting to my four year old son who needed stitches. The office was clean and the staff were extremely helpful and efficient in getting us in and on our way. Thank you so much! We highly recommend Drs Lee and Rose City Dental.]
