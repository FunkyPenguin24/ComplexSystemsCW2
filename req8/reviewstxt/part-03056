[113205515725058123514,100317752930010273698,My husband and I have been staying at the Birchwood Inn for at least the last 15 years -- and we wouldn't consider staying anyplace else. Every room in the Inn is a gem, the staff and service is exceptional, and the breakfasts are without a doubt the best I have ever had -- anywhere. In the past, we had always stayed at the Birchwood during the summer months, but lately I've been coming up on my own nearly every month to get some quality work done for my clients (without the distractions of home). I've now stayed there every season and each season the Inn has it's particular charms and comforts: the peaceful porch in the warm months, the comfy sitting room and parlor (with fireplaces) in the winter. I really do consider this my home away from home. Seeing Ellen upon my arrival always warms my heart. She really knows how to make her guests feel welcome and comfortable.]
