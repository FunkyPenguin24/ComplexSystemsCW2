[112102084321974360628,100016182669307079811,Total scam of a company. Sends you lots of bogus invoices trying to trick accounts payable departments into paying them. Have been receiving them for years and am finally sick of what they are doing. Their invoices look very real and threaten collections. But there is no phone number on them and they are mailed pre-sorted. Can't believe they stay in business. Most of these "positive" Google reviews I suspect are fake! They've created multiple web sites with fake everything to make it appear they are legitimate. They are even on linked in.]
