[101652052008345896544,101095444626279472938,My husband and I received "In the mail" a complimentary dinner offer for two from Dukes Country Bar & Grill and had to respond and make reservations via email. We had no idea what to expect, for we had never been to this establishment before. Once we arrived for the "First time" we noticed the cleanliness right away, and were seated promptly! The service was extremely courteous beyond mention!! The food was out of this world, and the portions.... the size for a king!! We will absolutely return to Dukes Country Bar & Grill and hope to become long standing customers for quit some time!! The best food and service ever!! Thank you Dukes!!]
