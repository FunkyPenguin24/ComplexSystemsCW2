[105457169373041892716,100082353432005024292,Cafe Osage WAS my favorite breakfast spot in St. Louis. My fianc√© and I drove a long way to get there this morning for breakfast and were turned away because we were 2 minutes late. LITERALLY TWO MINUTES PAST WHEN THEY STOP SERVING BREAKFAST. We arrived at 10:32am on a Saturday. They stop serving at 10:30. We tried to explain we came a long way to have breakfast... we offered to order before they seated us... they simply said no. We even spoke to what seemed to be the manager but she had no sympathy. It is extremely disappointing to have such TERRIBLE customer service from one of our favorite places.]
