[100824699174381168403,100966377908683117437,I am an Anthem resident and happy to finally have an excellent restaurant in our neighborhood. The food and drinks are outstanding! Much better than Buckman's Grille at the Revere Golf Club. The restaurant is beautiful, with modern furniture and an ambiance to match! The menu is simple, but has delicious selections. The meatloaf eggrolls are exceptional. Thank you Vic for finding Anthem. I will continue to enjoy Vic's as long as you are here.]
