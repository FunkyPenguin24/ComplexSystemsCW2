[111151215014343464649,100234992592310283934,I took my boyfriend here as a surprise treat and it really packs a wow factor. I had stayed before so knew what to expect but it's such a great hotel it feels like the first visit every time. Lovely clean rooms, friendly staff and great location. The theme rooms mack the stay so much more than a normal night in a hotel. The only negative was that my boyfriend, at 6'4", couldn't stand in our shower in the top floor Ophelia Fancy room!]
