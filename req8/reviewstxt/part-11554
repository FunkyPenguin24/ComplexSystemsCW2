[109876428875887523405,100776541478783739493,I have attended college in Baltimore for a year now and always went back home to my local barber for a mediocre cut and long wait. I finally decided to find a Barbershop in the area and found Royal Razor. I was greeted by a chipper small dog, there was no wait, great customer service, great quality cut, and a very well designed. This is the BEST BARBERSHOP I have EVER been to! I will definitely be back.]
