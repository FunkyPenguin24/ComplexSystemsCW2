[106694516616927160748,100095524755622437411,My stay at La Sacrista was the icing on the cake of my trip to Spain. Not only were last minute reservations available, but the room was reasonably priced for its location; in easy walking distance to the beach, bus station and the ferry. The staff were very accommodating; even the owners of the La Sacristia were more than happy to assist us with our travel needs. Everyone was very friendly and helpful; they helped arrange our tour to Morocco, provided us with our dining needs or recommendations to local restaurants. I was absolutely blown away when on my day of departure, the front desk was momentarily unmanned and one of the owners - seeming like another guest, sitting at a table in the sunshine enjoying his cappuccino and the paper - simply rose from his seat to call me a cab. He was oh so helpful, wonderfully friendly, and I had no idea until well into the conversation he was one of the three who had invested his past, present and future into the success of the hotel; and a Mid-Atlantic US original!! I enjoyed our conversation up until the moment our cab arrived, and I certainly recommend Posada La Sacristia to any future traveler.]
