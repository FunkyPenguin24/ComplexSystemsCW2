[103652720344233278791,100260940474053979662,You get a lot of food for your money! Many things on the menu you can request different levels of spicy. We like our spicy food! General Tso Chicken is my favorite!! Lunch time is the cheapest time to go. Meals come with choice of Egg Flower soup or Sweet and Sour. The decor is like stepping back in to 1975 but the food is worth it! Waitresses, not the best, but again for the food it's worth it!]
