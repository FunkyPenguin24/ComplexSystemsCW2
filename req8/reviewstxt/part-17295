[104764353269746038131,101091921958756060732,Hello my fellow friends in Virginia, I called the Verizon store today to set up home internet because I just bought a tablet from them and switched my cell service so I thought combin it all. First the girl on the phone was so incompident she could not spell Kevin I think she was drunk honestly she ran my credit four times then fraud protection came up now I have to copy my I'd and FAX to them they say they have no email to do this with. What....so I go to Verizon office and the receptionist was so rued I could not believe it I told people about this at Verizon and the most I got was a shoulder shrug not even a sorry. I was trying to do Verizon right and put all my phone and internet services together. No I will be happy to pay restocking fee and find a company that would like to have a customer I was with attention for 10yrs so this was going to be a long relationship it really is sad these days. All they could do is look past me for a new customer so now they are in the same boat with attention and bank of america]
