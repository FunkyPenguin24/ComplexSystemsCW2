[106641177067582293694,100213645709105659373,I've always loved this Bugatti's. The service is friendly and professional, the food is great, the atmosphere is nice, and prices are very reasonable. It's one of our favorite go-to places, a place we like to take out of town visitors. The thing that really makes it stand out though, is the complimentary focaccia bread and olive oil for dipping. My husband, daughter and son in law were there last Friday night, and it was very busy. We had to ask for the focaccia bread and oil, which usually come automatically. After asking twice we finally received it, and then only one small serving. I hope that this was only because the restaurant was so busy, and that it isn't going by the way-side. As I said, it's the thing that really makes Bugatti's stand out in my mind. If they do away with it, we won't go there nearly as often, and it'll become like any other Italian restaurant. So please, keep it coming!]
