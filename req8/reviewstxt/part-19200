[117764817740807224620,100016244297802479903,Oh my God how is this company in business???? I can honestly say in all 38 years of my life this is one of the worst company I have ever dwelt with. If you order something on-line and you see the shipping carrier is YRC cancel your order immediately. Everyday I get a 9am-1pm time frame for delivery and every time they call at 1:30 or 3:15pm and now 4pm and tell me they are running late and will have to reschedule. Yesterday the excuse was they forgot to load it on the truck. Three separate times and NO package. I am beside myself. This type of company actually really makes you appreciate UPS, USPS & Fed-X]
