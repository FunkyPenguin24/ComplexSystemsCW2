[106574751259216678642,100065244329164476502,Good food and prompt service, but the place is dark and cold. Mood lighting is one thing, but this is a pub. Use the flashlight app on your smartphone to read the menu. Beautiful 25 ft cathedral ceiling and window wall makes it tough to heat the place in winter. Far too many patrons dining wearing their coats. Nice selection of beer.]
