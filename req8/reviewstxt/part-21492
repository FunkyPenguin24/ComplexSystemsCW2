[101145306541454098541,100139330209026624549,I stayed here on Sunday 7th October 2012 and was very impressed. The staff and service at the hotel was excellent and the room (a skyline room on the 17th floor - the view / balcony is great) was perfect. Particular thanks to the front of house staff who were very helpful in finding the sights and sounds in and around Midtown. Great hotel well recommended - I work in the travel industry and will recommend this to anyone wanting a nice hotel in a great location.]
