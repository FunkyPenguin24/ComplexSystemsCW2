[102009957203800723230,100192065366749816994,my wife and I just purchased a 2010 Jeep Grand Cherokee from Damian here. Very nice gentleman and gave us great choices. He was able to work out a great deal for us....and was very patient...considering we ar not easy to deal with. The service department also was very cooperative. They gave us a great deal on a remote start addon. I highly recommend these guys over here.]
