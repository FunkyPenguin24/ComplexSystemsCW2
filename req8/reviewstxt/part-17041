[100505655947159684124,101078128819363163327,I just had the worst meal I've ever had at a waffle house. The beef was over cooked while everything else was undercooked, nearly raw onions, soggy hashbrowns, wrong bread. If Serji is cooking you should just walk back out the door and go elsewhere, he is in too much of a hurry to worry about cooking the food right, even at a slow time.]
