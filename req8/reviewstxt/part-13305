[117058371292213876653,100874378501562978949,Don't let the $3 sushi rolls foul you! They are wonderful! Once you get to know the owner, you'll venture off the specials. He completely understands what food profiles go together. The decor is simple, but it also is clean. I don't often give a 5 star rating, but Blue Bamboo deserves it.]
