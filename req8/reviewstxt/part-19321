[103026363298220488692,100023768646644344063,As a man, I had never been very comfortable walking into a jewelry store. I felt embarrassed about my lack of knowledge, and II felt like they were trying to get deeper into my wallet than I was prepared for. That all changed when I walked into Nettles Fine Jewelry. Clay and his friendly and knowledgeable staff always take the time to help me find that special gift and come in under budget. Recently we had our sixth wedding anniversary, and my wife requested a large formal style bangle. I headed off to Nettles of course, and about 3 associates helped me dig through their inventory until we finally found a special order bracelet that fit the bill. Needless to say, my wife was thrilled. I love how I can make my wife smile on a regular basis with jewelry that doesnâ€™t break the bank but appears to be very expensive. I just need to make sure I always hide the receipts!]
