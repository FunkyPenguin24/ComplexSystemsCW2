[102445942437532702390,100933933014234663454,FALSE ADVERTISING AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES I was very disappointed to discover this dealership advertising three 2012 model Kia Optima SX models as new with no miles and then find out they were demos with over 5000 miles each. Moreover, one of them was even damaged in the left front quarter panel and there was substantial wheel damage. I also was angered by the bait and switch pricing practice of advertising $8,000 off retail on select new models including the model I was interested in A20346 Kia Optima SX and discovered they wanted to provide pricing that was $2700 higher than it should be. Buyer beware of this store.]
