[117195186778867501060,100348755853603584643,Nothing new under the sun. Not advise even my enemies to use this UPS office. Unprofessional and careless manager. Dealing with personal issues failed to give me a copy of the customs declaration from an international shipping. Because I live far from UPS office I asked the copy of the document to be sent by fax to me. She promised to do it but this never happened. Arrogance and lack of common sense.]
