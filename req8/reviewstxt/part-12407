[113962513108057665286,100823671094590735120,Being the klutz that I am, I smashed an Android phone's front screen up really good. Which is bad. So, as I wept loudly, clenching my once beautiful $350 phone, I began looking for screen repair options. The local shops were conspicuous and the websites of other online services looked shoddy and barely had any reviews. I originally was going to go with another company, but I saw iResQ recommended in an article and decided to look at the site. Then, I saw this: "Note: If you see a lower price somewhere else, check their reviews then check ours. There are other companies that use cheap, knockoff parts in an attempt to offer lower pricing. Make sure you do your research before deciding on a repair company." I raised my eyebrow, did some research, and decided that the extra $40 or so could be worth it. Boy, was I ever right! I needed my phone fast and iResQ had the shipping option to match that need. I shipped it out, they did their magic, and the phone was back in my hand, looking very, very sexy, just two days after shipping it in. I must commend iResQ for their speedy service, professionalism, and charming business cards. Thanks! Christopher P.]
