[110469514728521839905,100472139924878063053,Do not stay here. I found a bed bug crawling in my bed. I notified the office it took them several hours to change my room. Then I gave them the bed bug as proof. After I checked out they called me and said that what I saw was a water bug and that I must have brought it in my luggage. I would NEVER RECOMMEND this BED BUG INFESTED HOTEL!!!]
