[114092346551821868558,100709435361645717831,I selected Sublett Studios to photograph our wedding last summer. After meeting with multiple Wichita area photographers, I felt that with Sublett I would get the artistic photo quality that I desired for a very affordable price--and I was right. I typically dislike being photographed, and so I was thankful for the confidence and calmness that Heather and Amber brought to our photo shoots. Their sweet personalities put me at ease. Heather has been so easy to work with before, during and since our wedding. I highly recommend Sublett Studios!]
