It started with buying a jacket at the Motorcycle show back in 2010 and has continued since then. My favorite helper, Todd Ellsworth, finished school and moved on, but whether it was ordering parts, service, or dealing with clothing, I've never had a bad experience dealing with the people at Westside.]
