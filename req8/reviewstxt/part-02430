[101497719240880194932,100284299336350394614,As a resident of Toronto and a student of the University of Western Ontario, I was worried about how I was going to move all my apartment furnishings from downtown all the way out to London. I found Metropolitan Movers easily on the web, and was reassured by the information page on their website, "Yes, we do long distance moves." I also appreciated their free quotes look-up available right on the homepage, letting me know exactly what I was buying, and letting me know their rates were competitive. Throughout the process, I was never worried about my possessions, as the movers were open, transparent, and professional. I will continue to use their services every time I require moving between Toronto and UWO!]
