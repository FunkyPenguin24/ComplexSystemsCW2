[115711301539525083796,100466072879878849603,i participated in a bikram class tonight and i really enjoyed it. i had been abit nervous about the heat but Robert managed it so well and with such sensitivity that i was able to stay in the practice and not fell overwhelmed. i am so glad that i went, it is not my usual style yet circumstances conspired to lead me to that class tonight, and i was rewarded, i was freed from my own mind restrictions about habitual practices and my body and energy system was strengthened from a different point of view! lucky me!!!Thanks Robert for teaching such an awsume class, and thankyou Andrea, for being you to me. i love you guys. xx Dana]
