[110897051929463120735,100183835171418950063,Eye doctors in Rockville are all over the place. You can get glasses or contacts just about anywhere now (even Walmart!). That said, what you can't get anywhere else is an optometrist who will treat you with the respect, care, concern and professionalism that Dr. Glazier and his team will give you. Over the past three years I have been treated with nothing less than the honest concern one would expect from a health care provider. Hats off to Dr. Glazier and his entire team.]
