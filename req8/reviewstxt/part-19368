[101499907234616016505,100026025449850080474,Look @ other reviews, I'm not alone....it's a shame, he is the only jet ski business around Columbus Mike has all the answers, if you live in 1985. He is not current on his knowledge of high performance PWC's. He will site examples of tips, and parts he recommends, I'll take that to my Jet Ski forums w/ professional Jet ski builders, and riders: They laugh!. ie. a new $275 impeller, can be improved by 'setting it back', closer to the stator vane. He said to 'add a hook' at the trailing edge,...and the kid, is mentally somewhere else]
