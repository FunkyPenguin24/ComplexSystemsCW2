[101492409956865882961,100451363512390568879,At first I wasn't too sure about this place because I love places with red doors. But you know, orange being a relative of red I decided to give this place a shot. The Orange Door Dental Team seems to be well balance and knowledgable. Walking in there for the first time, I felt this positive energy which led to comfortability. Kayla was the one that clean my teeth, and my teeth feel pretty clean. She's very knowledgable, keep up the good work. It's been some time, so i know i got alot of fixing to do. I believe the ODD team could do it. So if your looking for a great place to get your teeth done, this is the spot to do it. ^^v]
