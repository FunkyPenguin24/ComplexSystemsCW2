[109874773830317256761,100946845716172353758,The Doxey Real Estate Group is the best in the business! Joe, Nate, and their team made the process of finding and moving my elderly parents an excellent experience. Nate was very professional and did everything in his power to find the perfect place for my parent. He was willing to take phone calls any day at any time. He was also very prompt at setting up showings at the many properties that my parents were interested in at the times that worked for us. They made us feel like we were the only clients they had. Very prompt, professional and detail oriented. Being that my parents are elderly it is very difficult for them to leave there home. The Doxey group was willing to bring all paperwork to them from start to finish which greatly eased this stressful situation for my parents. Classy Group! I am looking forward to listing/selling my parents old home with Doxey group in the immediate future.]
