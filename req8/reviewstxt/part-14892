[113327899912387101696,100961429756466153868,Fantastic dinner and really friendly staff. A word of advice; if in a reasonable group, ask for the mains as a tapas sharing meal - it's really fun and you get to taste everything on offer. Good value for money too with the prosecco no more expensive than their wines.]
