[111860356859466102321,100413657821904003926,I purchased my car from Jason Murray a few years ago and had a great experience. He was honest and straight forward in every step of the process and went out of his way to help me find a car that fit my budget and needs. I was a student at Purdue when I purchased a used Honda Civic that is still running well 3 years later. I had looked at several other car dealerships prior and experienced some of the stereotypical pushiness from salesmen that were clearly more interested in the sale than what I wanted. It is not like this at all at Bob Rohrman Honda. I am so glad that I found this dealership and would absolutely recommend it and Jason Murray to anyone who is looking for a new or used vehicle.]
