[109761489277340727882,100486747143492512566,I lived in a Lobos Owned property in Avalon (Queensbury) for almost 2 years. Never had a problem at all. The heat was included in the rent, which was very nice, especially when budgeting expenses. My electric bill was usually less than $50 and a water bill ran about $20ish. Very reasonable. Off street parking. Nice neighborhood, too. While I was there, they replaced all the hallway carpets and the hallway wall coverings. We got new washing machines and dryers in the second year. I had one issue with a leaking faucet and an entire new faucet was put in a few hours after I called the office. One thing I liked about the building was that it had cement ceilings... I never heard anything from my neighbors, not even a footstep, unless we were both on our decks at the same time. Kuhns grocery was 3 blocks away. Ohio River Blvd another 3 blocks away in a different direction. I was only 3 miles from the stadiums and casino. The cost savings to live outside the city as opposed to downtown, Mt. Washington, Shadyside, etc...far outweighed the inconvenience of driving a few extra miles.]
