[104798480655188338009,100126666602774984742,I'm posting to voice my displeasure regarding Staple's business practices and how it treats its customers.Today, I went to the store to return my laptop (OS was not running ) and I was told by the manager that, In order to take it back, the PC must have to work. Why would somebody return something that still works . She also told me that , Its look like its been used more than two days, even though the PC run time is less then 24 Hrs (according to the OS). Needless to say, I will be taking my business elsewhere in the future.]
