[103834164765898164373,100935573299262171819,This is some of the WORST Chinese food I have ever had. Honestly I refuse to eat here anymore . Since was the only Chinese joint in town I kept going back. The third time back I was physically ill. It is no surprise to me another Chinese Restaurant opened in the same plaza next to Food Lion not 400 feet away. There food is not "great" but it is a lot better and hours later I do not feel ill.]
