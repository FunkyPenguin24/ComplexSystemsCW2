[103189323880370023276,101062707022998463500,Awesome instructors that teach the kids to read and love music. I have two boys Cody and Josh the oldest has been taking lessons for 9 years and is an awesome guitar player who can play any sheet of music placed in front of him thanks to two incredible music teachers at Performance School of Music Nate and Mark. Josh our youngest plays the piano and has taken lessons for 7 years, his teacher Grace has done an amazing job teaching him songs he loves to play around our house. I can't say enough about how much I appreciate The Performance School of Music and what they have taught our boys over the years. Everyone is friendly, professional, and enthusiastic. If your looking for a great place to take your children for music lessons look no further then here.]
