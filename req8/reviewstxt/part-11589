[101294486156082486701,100778782461588256805,Never take your pet here! I made the mistake of taking my dog there bcs I thought he had an ear infection, I asked how much it would cost to get him examined, tested and get the meds, they told me no more than $80. Well $200 later I found out that it wasn't an ear infection after all. The whole visit consisted of them forcing me to watch stupid videos about their monthly plan which they try to shove down your throat and on top of it all they couldn't even spell my dogs name right...]
