[105249653250302093161,100992180065047558443,So far I am very pleased. I am having lower back pain and now numbness in my right leg and have just started my 2nd week of treatment. My first 3 visits last week resulted in soreness as Dr Shepherd said they would but I am looking forward to reaching a point where I can walk without the discomfort I have had this past year. I want my quality of life back and I believe with Dr Shepherd's expertise I will get it. Stay tuned for more updates.]
