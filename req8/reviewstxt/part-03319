[110828752964420415436,100330666873037529027,We got takeout from this place last weekend, it was really good. I got General Tao chicken with an eggroll and rice. The chicken is actual tenders, not those balls of gloop. The warning, the eggroll was kind of greasy. The rice was great. My girlfriend got shrimp lo mien with crab Rangoon's and fried rice. She like it as well, oddly enough the Rangoon's were not greasy like the eggroll. If you go get the dumplings/potstickers and get them pan seared. They actually pan sear them and not fry. The cost was like 23 for all of this. Like I said get the potstickers, delicious and you get six of them, and they are large. Free delivery to us, we live in college park]
