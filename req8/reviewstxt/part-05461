[104074658478175447556,100449340381942971580,This is gym lives up to it's name! I joined in September 2013 and I am Reclaiming My Life! As someone who has spent 30 years going to various gyms Crossfit Reclamation is what I desperately needed to get serious about my fitness. Kathy owns the gym and coaches most classes. She fosters a unique gym community that supports each other and great friendships emerge. She is strict about doing daily mobility and having proper form so you don't injure yourself. She helps us set goals and caters our pre-workout and post workout exercises to help each individual. I am addicted and look forward to being there and when I miss a class it bums me out. Worth every penny! ~ Matt Grazier]
