[116472822484773546479,101085320465814581243,I have been playing soccer for over 25 years. Indoor soccer over the last 5 years has not be great. forced travel to woodscross for two sandy/draper teams to play. It is finally nice to have a world class facility in our own back yards. the facility is great, the two on field ref system is great. Fees are competitive! Great youth programs during the summer time. Nothing but props to soccer city, finally someone is doing it right.]
