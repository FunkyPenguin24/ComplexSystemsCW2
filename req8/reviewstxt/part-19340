[104314335367690123722,100025194288569041825,Worst experience Ever. 4 and 1/2 inch pregnant roach came into my room through the huge crack in the door. When I called the front desk to ask for bug spray, the lady was rude and didn't even apologize. Finally managed to kill it. So gross. I just wanted a cheap room and I can handle most anything but not huge roaches. Took a shower and checked out...was there maybe 4 hours. They wouldn't refund my money. And when I called to speak to the manager, he was even rude. DO NOT STAY HERE! unless you don't mind roaches.]
