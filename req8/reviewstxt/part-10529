[103805058864861493563,100721815547041830268,They are excellent! I NEVER EVER cared for red velvet cake. Until I tried theirs. THE STORY: I bought a few for a party since everyone seemed to like red velvet cake. They all took a bite into it and their eyes turned into huge saucers. I was like "what?" And everyone freaked and talked about how amazing it tasted so I tried it and I was pretty floored. YUM!!!!! It doesn't taste like any red velvet I've ever had. It's a dream in a cupcake form. Now I'm afraid to get Red Velvet anywhere else.]
