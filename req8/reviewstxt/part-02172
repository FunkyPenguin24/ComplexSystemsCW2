[101666552376799578266,100271123309042200312,My experience at First Christian Church has been pretty good. I came here from San Diego and I began attending the Saturday evening service along with my wife before we got married. The atmosphere was informal (which I liked), and though the church was large, the atmosphere was intimate. The music was good, too. I'm a rock guy--always have been--and the music on Saturday evenings is not what you'd expect. It spoke to me powerfully and still does. I read the review at the bottom, and I'm very sorry that person had the experience they did. I have no idea who they spoke to that made them feel the way they do, or why those people said whatever they did to the person offended, but I want the offended person to know that not every person is going to make them feel uncomfortable. I don't know what kind of day the "holy" person they mentioned was having. I don't know anything about that person at all, but the truth is, that person could also have been anyone. It made me think about how it is I respond to people I don't know when I see them at church if they look different or act different than I do, or what I think people should act like at church. It's so easy to turn people away from God, and I never want to do that.]
