[106192606257527803811,100342281757589644297,HORRIBLE experience! I would not rent from Budget EVER AGAIN! The people at the service counter were very pushy and rude. I rented a car and was given a van because they were all out of cars. This was after being offered the option to upgrade to a BMW or Mustang convertible. Then, when I declined the insurance I was continuously badgered about what insurance I do have and how I should get their insurance. I extensively looking into the insurance situation before arriving and prefer not to be second guessed by the service about my decision. The return process was pleasurable but getting the car in the first place was a mess. I will not rent from Budget anymore. This location in particular has rude customer service.]
