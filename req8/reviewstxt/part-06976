[114367408245767171407,100531981930652511643,Don't bother having a maintenance issue after Noon at Prentice Park in Madison, and don't expect Gorman to have your back either. Their office hours are a farce. They come and go as they please, if ever to return at all. I had a living room heater go out at 3 PM on a Thursday in 0 degree weather and couldn't get a hold of a soul in the office (that claims they close at 5). When I called Gorman Corporate direct about an hour later, I was told to call their after hours emergency maintenance staff (again, they allegedly close the normal office at 5). When someone from the after hours staff finally got a hold of me at 6 PM, I was told they wouldn't be coming out to fix the heater, but provide a space heater, bringing a new and interesting twist to the word "maintenance." They then inquired whether my situation was life threatening, which I said "no, the base board heaters are still working in the bedrooms." I was then told that the "maintenance" person wouldn't bring the space heater, and to crank my base boards in the bedrooms to full blast to compensate for the lack of heat in the living room, and that someone would come look at it tomorrow. Keep in mind heat and electricity are NOT included in the rent! When I asked if he could still bring the space heater because it is QUITE cold in here, I was then told I would be charged for his time to come out, not Gorman!!! If you're thinking of renting Gorman, make SURE you bring your cash (lord knows you need it!!), but make sure to leave any expectations of anyone giving a damn about you at your last residence!!!]
