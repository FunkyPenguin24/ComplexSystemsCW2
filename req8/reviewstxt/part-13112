[107684366925635708839,100863982129333989921,I had never been to a BookMans, I was use to going to BookStop in Texas. Anyway, I had a great experience here. The staff were very helpful and even lead me to the books I was unable to find. They were all curteous and knowledgeable. I have not sold anything there so as far as their pricing and items of that specific nature I have no clue; however, my overall experience was great. Clean store, great staff and awesome items! Will return.]
