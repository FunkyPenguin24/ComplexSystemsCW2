[107145899250162399002,100170536972868318894,My husband and I went to Orange Hill Restaurant for our wedding anniversary this July 4th 2013. They took us right in even though our reservation wasn't for another half hour. We had a beautiful view of the city to watch the fireworks and were pleased with the seating. The waitress was very nice but we couldn't help overhearing at the next table that the diners had to pay for bread while they waited for dinner. They sent it back because they didn't want to pay 8 dollars for flatbread. My husband asked the waitress about the bread and she said they have some they offer but they charge for the special breads now. I ordered a 55 lobster dinner with a 8 dinner salad. We noticed that the table settings were very sparse. If you ordered a salad you had to keep the same fork for dinner. I know this is a common practice but not usually at a more pricey restaurant. After waiting for 45 minutes for dinner we complained that we wanted our food and the waitress said there were a lot of tickets before ours. The people who ordered after us got their food and it was a table of 4. The manager came over and bought us drinks so that helped. The whole point of this review is a couple of things, the lobster dinner I received was one of the biggest rip offs I've ever had. It was a 6 oz tail on a plate with a square of potatoes and 3 mind you 3 pieces of asparagus. And the other thing is the whole place seemed like it was a restaurant going out of business. Cut backs on the bread and silverware and skimpy embarrassing food. My husband saw them turn away people that did not have reservations but 3 tables sat empty the whole time we were there. We've been eating at this place for our anniversary for 4 or 5 years and they owe me a do over.]
