[117620628647401529917,100755828917607095529,I hired Apex to do a color-match on my 2004 Audi allroad's front bumper, rear bumper and fenders. They did a phenomenal job, especially considering how much work was needed to clean up the wear and tear on the rear bumper. Randy was very nice, gave me a tour of the shop and kept me updated throughout the week-long process. I highly recommend Apex to anyone needing paint or body work.]
