[112159296504354991557,100329390682383699223,Dropped in to eat here based on other's reviews and my wife and I had our best meal of the weekend in Wilmington. We would have come back twice if they weren't closed on Sunday! I had the Black Sea Combo and my wife had the grouper. Service was great, very personable service, food was awesome. Was cool for the chef to come out to collect our dishes and be so genuinely happy that we cleaned our plates! Be sure to save room for the Knefeh desert...I'm still craving that.]
