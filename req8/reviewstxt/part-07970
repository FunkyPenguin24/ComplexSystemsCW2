[115202042946638050329,100586032898497965670,I would like to say that in my seven years of almost daily business dealings with Sure Sarvival I have had nothing but positive interaction and results. I can only speak of my personal experiences and will go on record as saying I believe him to be a fair and honest man. The fact that some people can grab information off the internet, you know…like any 3 or 5 year old could do today, doesn’t say much about the person to me. I agree that you entitled to your opinion; however it’s when you leave the realm of opinion and enter into the realm of slander that bothers me.]
