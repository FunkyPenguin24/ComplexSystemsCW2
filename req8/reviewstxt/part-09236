[100954626024957811358,100651753464669881749,Staff was excellent. I worked with 2 gentlemen who took the time to show and explain the nuances and differences between the Glock 23, 27 and S&W M&P .40 C and Shield. Their prices were very competitive with online, as Buds Gun Shop wanted $30 less for the same gun, but FFL fee would have made the difference moot. I'd rather support a local store anyway...]
