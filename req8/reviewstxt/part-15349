[111246130563026208426,100984629597022439413,Went there for the first time today, because my usual barber (Fellas, over the road) was closed, with no signs explaining why. Great way to lose customers. Anyway, I was really impressed with the haircut I got at Al-Baddar, and the friendly guys working there. I'll definitely be going back.]
