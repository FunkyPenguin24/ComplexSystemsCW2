[102912517939070096343,100866437875930936103,An Angie's List deal pointed me in the direction of A to Z for my chimney cleaning and repairs. They were GREAT! The technician explained what he was doing during each step of the inspection and cleaning. He identified three issues, which he believed needed to be addressed. He was honest that one of the issues should be addressed soon while the other two issues could wait. I felt comfortable with his assessment and had him repair two of the three issues. The technician was amazing! He took every precaution to make sure the area around the fireplace was covered with tarps and there was no mess whatsoever I asked how often the chimney should be cleaned and the technician indicated that, given my pattern of use, once every three years would be sufficient. He had me self-address a post card so that A to Z could remind me about the next cleaning IN THREE YEARS! A to Z offers FANTASTIC customer service!!! I would recommend A to Z for all of your chimney cleaning and repairs! I know I'll be using them again!!!]
