[104614271694997965189,101108352912691377857,I have appreciated the cleanliness of the facility, the friendliness of the staff and how well they communicate. The place works and is dry and temperature controlled which I greatly appreciate. I like being able to access it for extended periods during the day. it would be nice if corporate would replace the front sliding doors. we customers have banged into them a few times and now their mis alignment slows their operation. that's my only concern.]
