[102015708129515776328,101054437032078593545,I specifically mentioned the ad on TV for the Steak & Lobster @$14.99 & the waiter said he would do that price even though the charge $18.99 then he proceeded to charge me full price. I had to leave & couldn't argue it as we were in a hurry & he took forever to come back, I also had a issue with the soup & he said he would send me home a dessert & then never mentioned it again. I was really disappointed for a $105.00 dinner for four. I can see why restaurants are closing here in Salinas, there is no quality of product or service. Very sad]
