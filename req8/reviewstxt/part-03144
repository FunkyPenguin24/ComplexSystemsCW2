[103122416077756049710,100321671189114043044,I purchased a 2013 Dodge Dart i love the car! Its loaded and gets awesome gas mileage. My salesman was Brad Kale, he is very professional and polite and isnt pushy at all he gives u the facts about the car and lets u decide. i was very happy with my experience at Community Chrysler. I have referred 2 friends already one of them got a car just like mine and she loves hers also! Thanks Brad!]
