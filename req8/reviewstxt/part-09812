[110454580833019638864,100682181286128816683,Terrible experience with these people. I hired them to do an Administrative Law Judge application and resume, paying them well over $2000. Though I have been a social security disability attorney for over 20 years, their "expert" Nicole Schultheis failed to properly articulate and word my social security disability experience in the application, causing the government to reject my application by contending that I had failed to prove that I have over 7 years of social security disability experience! The resume she drafted was shoddy, and she lifted whole paragraphs from my website to the resume rather than professionally drafting it. When I approached Ms. Schultheis and Ms. Troutman about their incompetence, they refused to offer me any refund or accommodation. Though I did EXACTLY what Ms. Schultheis directed me to do in the application, she tried to blame me for the rejection of my application, saying that I must have made some changes or otherwise screwed the application up. Stay far, far away from these people...]
