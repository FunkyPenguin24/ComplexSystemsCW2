[117310887499016159812,100360292815646586940,I had a horrible experience at Freeway Ford. I bought a used car there last year and they sold me the Service Contract, which I understood to cost $500 at the time. When I later read more of the fine print, I saw that it actually cost $2500, and I called the next day to ask that it be removed. They insisted there was absolutely nothing they could do to remove it and made me keep it. Now, less than one year later, that same car needs a $3700 engine repair (not due to negligence or misuse on my part ) and the repair is NOT covered by the Service Contract. What a lemon!]
