[110934430384806132193,100039689938571791736,Mirage Limousines was a great group, my driver Tim was early and very good at communicating with me throughout the night. The limo was clean inside and out. I only wish we had more time to drive around. One nice thing about this company is that if your car is over booked, or the people before you took longer than expected, you get a limo, but one of a "higher" level.]
