[103095417082173992512,100143744936120596141,I never write reviews but felt obligated to warn people of how slow this place is. The kids like the arcade which is probably the only reason we would ever go again. The service is the absolute slowest we have ever experienced. The first few times we gave them the benefit of doubt. But after several times here, it is agonizing how slow and inefficient they are. Not sure management has any restaurant experience and I feel bad for the staff that have to hear the complaints. PUBLIC NOTICE: do not go here if you plan for a quick exit or even a reasonable exit. Plan on staying for 2+ hours for diner food.]
