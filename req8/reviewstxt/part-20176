[105109575734484654892,100069345894836410743,Today was a good day took my truck in for service it was making a noise and they took me right in and I waited for about an hour and they found the problem. I was done in about 3 hours and it was covered by warranty. This made it a good day. I didnt mention but I had taken it to another place and they were unable to find the issue so I am glad I took a chance on the dealership.]
