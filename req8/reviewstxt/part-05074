[112337751874950751131,100427284521690608589,My fiancee and I were looking for a great sub or deli in town, and we found one. We happened to show up just before they closed. They still invited us in and talked us through the menu. They were knowledgable in what they had, and even offered sandwiches they thought we'd like. The menu is robust enough for anyone. We also liked how they sliced their meats fresh, and even create their roast beef in house. We both got 7 inch subs, and they filled both of us up. Price wasn't bad either. Jersey Shore has been open for 8 years, and this was the first time I've heard of it. I wish Rock Hill City would allow them a sign, because they are hidden away in a corner. We even stayed after they closed, and they allowed us to take our time, and even offered us more fresh sweet tea while my fiancee and I sat and talked. Great place, great food, great service, and great people. I recommend this to everyone. :D]
