[110962987250428262973,100367132079374011438,Last time we came here we had the big breakfast and it was amazing, beautifully cooked eggs, delicious baked beans, toasted ciabatta... Since then they must have changed management because the breakfast menu has far less options and the food... The big breakfast took at least half an hour to come out and it was underwhelming, one cold piece of toast, a bitter hash brown (time to replace the oil?), "home made" baked beans which weren't even cooked/soft (gimme Heinz any day!). Like others have said, the cafe's location has given it a monopoly and the price is too high for the quality that you get. Won't be coming back for many years at least.]
