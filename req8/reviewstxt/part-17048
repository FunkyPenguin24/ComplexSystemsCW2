[114785386794822582106,101078777699260681847,I'm a tricky patient to have --- I get extremely anxious with any kind of procedure, and having an hour-long root canal made me more nervous than I'd like to admit. Not only were the Dr. and assistant friendly and understanding but they did a wonderful job on my hard-to-reach tooth. Would definitely recommend.]
