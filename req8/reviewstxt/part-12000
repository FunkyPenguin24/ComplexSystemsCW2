[110157409534754169046,100801098722783830814,A Plus rebuilt the transmission in my '03 Avalon last year and recently it had developed a small leak. Even though I was past my warranty by nearly a thousand miles, they replaced the transmission pan gasket and changed the fluid (which is synthetic on mine, usually a $99 service) for FREE!! They also replaced a defective sensor mounted to the transmission housing which technically wasn't even covered under the warranty at no charge--WOW! Scott, the service manager, is awesome to deal with and the car was ready when he said it would be. I'm an A Plus customer for life!]
