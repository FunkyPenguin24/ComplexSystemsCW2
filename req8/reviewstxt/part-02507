[109200396701830305293,100288545664062523096,I highly recommend Valley View Vet Clinic. The staff has always been very helpful and kind whenever I have called with questions. Yes, they are busy, but I believe they handle things quite well despite that. As for Dr. Lee, she is best veterinarian I have ever had for my animals. She's great with the animals and I feel she does an excellent job anytime I've taken any of mine to see her. She is also very good at explaining and helping me understand how my pets are doing. You can tell she truly cares about what she does and the animals that she sees. I can't imagine ever going to anyone else for my pets needs. Thank you Dr. Lee and staff for always being awesome!]
