[106487364747679286784,100920399206939201247,I got the large chicken souvlaki dinner. The chicken was over-cooked and dry, the potatoes were okay - though not very flavourful, and the rice tasted like it came straight from a pack of uncle-bens instant microwave rice. For spending about $20 for my food, I was not filled up, nor was I satisfied by the flavour or the amount. Avoid this place - of course, when someone stands out front and practically drags you in saying it is the best Greek food, while the restaurant is mostly barren, then that should be large enough indicator to avoid the place.]
