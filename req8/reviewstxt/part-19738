[102022122823700955918,100046210949451018608,Maybe the barista trained at a Gulag. I'm not sure how else to explain why the coffee that I waited so long for tasted so bad. Liquid tarmac would have tasted better. Not only was the coffee distasteful, the service was slow and surly. And when I pointed out that my coffee was below par I was told I should "just get stuffed". Possibly the worst service I have ever had.]
