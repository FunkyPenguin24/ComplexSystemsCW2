[112896724135278167921,100501116937585756056,This is a fantastic place on a number of different reasons. I went there for a business lunch last Friday. The food was great and the wait staff attentive and pleasant. They were obviously well trained and they all seemed to really enjoy working there. After lunch my car had issues in their parking garage and before I knew it the general manager, Mike Gray, was standing next to me asking if he could do anything to help me. He suggested a great mechanic in the area if I needed one. I had to go to a meeting just up the road so I walked. Upon my return I hear that David Racine himself took a look at the car to see if he could get it going. Amazing. These people really went the extra mile. Keep in mind this all happened during lunch rush. They certainly know how to treat their patrons well and it's because they truly care. No wonder itâ€™s a local landmark. I will be back!]
