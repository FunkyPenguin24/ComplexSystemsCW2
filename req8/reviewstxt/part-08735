[118338885988288994928,100625168134774068751,Really nothing more than a mill. The optometrist was a nice but clearly overworked. No reason why I showed up 15 minutes prior to my appt but still had to wait 30 minutes after my appt time to be seen. Its now been 5 weeks since my appt and no glasses. No follow up, nothing. Really bad customer service. Stick to Costco or Lens Crafters I am editing my review and raising it from 1 star to 3 stars. The sole reason I am editing this review and increasing the star rating is because of the manager, Rose. She is professional, courteous, and handled my problem right away with various options and solutions.]
