[105397638815328368858,100977387757889162140,I am a local small business located in this beautiful city. I always keep my entertainment local wben possible. I have been to this location on 3 occasions. The food is always good along with their drinks. The last friday I went for happy hour and dinner I went to the restroom and advised the bar tender that I was not finished wbile I went to the bathroom. Upon returning to my outside table my dinner had been thrown away to clear the table because they were very busy. I have not returned because they did not offer to replace my dinner that I had eaten 2 bites of. I intented on contacting the manager because the staff is good but very young. I just started going somewhere else. Good food, beware if you intend on taking your food home, it might be gone when you return.]
