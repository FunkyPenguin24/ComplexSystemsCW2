[107466861489408868250,101052496802795576530,I order very often from here as I live close by I have spent several hundred dollars here in a very short time. I always tip well and always get delivery. The orders always consist of in part, a Spicy Tuna Roll and generally I ask for additional ingredients, specifically avocado and cream cheese which I am willing to pay additional for. However each time this order comes what I get is a slice of tuna with avocado and cream cheese. When I called to ask about this I was told the spicy part is only a sauce with a slice of tuna. However when I order just spicy tuna I get the traditional minced tuna. Since the food was good I continued to order from here. Yesterday I tried to place an order which included the lunch special which they state in writing is from 10:30-4:00. When I called was prior to 4:00 yet I was told it was too close to 4:00 to order. I asked for a manager and was told that Carie would be in tomorrow to call then. Today I called Carie. I tried to explain in very simple terms what my issue was with the Spicy Tuna. She told me that she couldn't understand me, the spicy tuna was always finely chopped and told me not to order from there anymore to call someone else. I was shocked. I was never able to inquire about the lunch specials before she hung up on me. I called back and told her that I had spent hundreds there in about 2 months (verified through my online order history), and that I would no longer order from there. This business barely speaks English but I was patient and understanding. If you get unsatisfactory customer service don't bother to call.]
