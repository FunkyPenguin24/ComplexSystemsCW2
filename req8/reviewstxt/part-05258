[109512389922636488229,100438652756960381208,My fiance' and I love Andy's. We go here at least once weekly. The food is awesome, well priced, and the customer service is the biggest attraction. Bri, is our personal favorite among the waitresses, but all of the day staff is wonderful. I will say the high school girls that work here in the summer aren't as personable, but overall the BEST fast food around.]
