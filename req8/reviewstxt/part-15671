[111685747521898627039,101003340453976382597,We went on the Ultimate Adventure cruise during our honeymoon trip in Key West. My husband and I had a BLAST! The crew was amazing and very fun to talk with and hang out all day. The trip included snorkeling, jet skiing, and parasailing. During the snorkeling, I had some issues with getting the breathing right and panicked a little bit. Monty, one of the crew, took some time with me to help me get the breathing right. He was extremely understanding and helpful on the trip. This trip is worth every penny and we highly recommend it!]
