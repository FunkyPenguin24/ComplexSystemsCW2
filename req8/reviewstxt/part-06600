[106611657559153223088,100510548584700213065,I ordered a used bass guitar from Guitar Center's website, the bass was at this location (Ft. Wayne, IN) and was shipping to my local GC in Austin, TX. On the second day after my bass had shipped UPS's website showed that it had been delivered back to the store in Ft. Wayne. I contacted customer service from the GC website to see what was going on and if I could just go ahead and get the bass shipped directly to my home instead of the local store. The representative told me that he contacted the store and they got it back because there were two labels on the box and that it had been sent out again already so they could not ship it directly to me. He also told me that they'd email me a new tracking number right away. Well, no one ever emailed me the tracking number so I decided to call the store directly. The guy that answered the phone was cool, he grabbed the warehouse manager who located my bass still at their store. I asked if they could ship it directly to me, and not only did they ship it directly to me but they sent it in 1 day express delivery. Thanks GC of Ft. Wayne!]
