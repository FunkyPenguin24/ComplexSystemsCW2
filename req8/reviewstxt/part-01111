[104743172009835954981,100216418958700302129,Anchoring the new wave of hipster takeover in the Valencia area of the Mission, Fourbarrel is an excellent place for more than just coffee, but an excellent atmosphere with a good, art, music and style oriented community. Come enjoy a perfectly brewed espresso for relatively good value and have a seat. The decor is mostly bare, but it gives off a very minimal, industrial vibe that allows one to focus more on the coffee. The back of the establishment is the brewing portion of the cafe itself which makes sitting in the cafe more interesting as you can see the beans crushed just yards away. Come once, come often.]
