[108463340155010131674,101088849109100160012,Excellent experience with this location. I store my boat and jet ski here. No extra fees for storing both toys in one parking space, which is what my last storage facility did. Staff is extremely friendly; they found me a bucket to bail out my boat when my cover filled with water, and they called me to tell me my cover on my jet ski had a tear. How nice that someone is looking out for my investments when I'm not there. Great location and easy access too!]
