[105789230228660426220,100171750225152105040,I took my standard poodle there. I've been wary of trying any new groomer, he's had some horrible haircuts in the past! But Julian's showed excellent service, a clean environment, and really listened to what I wanted. My poodle boy came out prancing happily and with a great cut. I think what counts the most is that my dog was happy. He's been so miserable other places, so I imagine what happened behind closed doors was an excellent positive experience for him. It took 2 hours, which was much better than I expected, and I won't be taking my boy anywhere else!]
