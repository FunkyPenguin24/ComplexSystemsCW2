[115498135994633730232,100290837189024195174,It was our lucky day when Desiree' Steele from Anderson Auto Group, showed us the 2013 Ford Escape. My husband was waffling between the Escape and getting a 2013 Kia. Ms. Steele did a fantastic job of showing him, and later myself, all the features of the Escape. Never was there any 'push' to get us to purchase the vehicle. Her concern was that we both understand all of the fine details of the Escape. We did make that purchase, at a lesser price than the Kia, and have had calls from her since to make certain we are satisfied, and to answer any questions. We will most certainly be returning to Anderson Auto Group in the future, and we hope Desiree' is there to assist us. Thank you, Desiree'!]
