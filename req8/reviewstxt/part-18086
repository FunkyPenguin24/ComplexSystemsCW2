[101163396379109420595,101134047122718940285,My bf got his bike there and he noticed a defect after he bought it and rode it once. They wouldn't refund his money and brought it in for repairs which took well over a month. I give Canadian tire one star cause that's the minimum and its an okay place to buy bagged soil.]
