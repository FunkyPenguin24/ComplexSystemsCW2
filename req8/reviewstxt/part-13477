[109713635506593188421,100883976189163408359,As far as I'm concerned Gailor Animal Hospital is the best vet in the city of Louisville. They have been tremendously helpful with my two special need fur babies... They have provided excellent care for both of them, even on an emergency basis and they even extended my black lab's life by 2 years after she had a spinal injury. When we had to put her down at the beginning of this year, I have never felt so much love in one room. It was extremely touching. I think this whole practice is amazingly awesome.]
