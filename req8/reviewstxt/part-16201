[105761313343358788407,101031780962630103347,Was looking for a car for a few months now. Everywhere I went told me my credit wasn't good enough to get financed. I called Pittsburgh Auto Depot and talked to a guy named Scott who assured me he could get me financed! I admit I was skeptical at first as I felt I had exhausted all my avenues. After sitting and talking to Scott I found that he was a legit guy and I felt he wanted me to drive off with a car as bad as I did. Needless to say a day later I was driving off the lot in a super clean 2007 Cadillac DTS with only 70k miles on it. I can't even explain how good a deal I got on the car and how satisfied I was with my salesmen Scott and the whole Pittsburgh Auto Depot staff. I will definitely be returning and I look forward to doing business with them in the future.]
