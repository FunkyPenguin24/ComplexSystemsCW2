[106247456045571557871,100122640368681713567,We went to FCER on Saturday night with our 2 year old running a fever and possible ear infection expecting to be there for several hours. However, to our surprise we walked into an empty waiting room. We were taken to a room within five minuets & was seen by a Doctor within 15 minuets. The staff was very attentive and sensitive to our 2 year olds needs. It was fast, friendly and efficient we will definitely use FCER again if the need arises.]
