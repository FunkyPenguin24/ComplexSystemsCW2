[108044637927257223293,100228272263893671831,Super unprofessional and rude. I took a trip out to OZ to take a look for a project bike I was building and found that the prices were a bit high, there was very little help and the place was disorganized. They wouldn't even let me out in the yard to browse for bike parts. While I was there the owner kicked a guy out of the store and told him to never come back just because the guy asked for a discount on the parts he was buying. I also witnessed him selling a guy a scala bluethooth for something like $400. I the customer said he just wanted the ability to answer the phone but the owner of the store insisted that he needed the model that lets you communicate between bikes because it was a good feature and that he would want it in the future. The customer was apparently a long time customer as he came to pick up his bike that was being fixed and the owner knew him by name. It's one thing to rip off one time customers, it's another to rip off your loyal repeat customers. Shame on you Oz Powersports. That should have been enough for me to never buy from there but I needed a fairing stay for a 04 Yamaha R6 and I didn't have time to get one from the internet so I thought I would give them another chance. He wanted $140.00 and the going price on Ebay is between $50.00 and $60.00. When I asked him if he could do any better he went on a rant and told a story how he got parts from ebay, there was no warranty and how he had to make money. Before I could say anything he hung up on me. I was actually willing to pay the 3x markup for the part so I could make the next track day but not after being hung up on. I would rather not ride then to ever do business with this guy. Beware!!!!!]
