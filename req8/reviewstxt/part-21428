[110749020330633778881,100136402905050931884,I cannot get anyone on the phone here to check out availability (their phone number is mysteriously showing on South Commons site. Buddy! The purpose of the phone is so you do NOT have to WASTE TIME driving to Walmarts that do not have product in stock! Your "defense" of this Walmart is as bad as their service is. However, I do realize that they are still setting up shop at this new store, and are most likely even more understaffed than the others right now.]
