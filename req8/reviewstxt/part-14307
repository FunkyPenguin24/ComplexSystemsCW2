Specifically, the Lo Mein was made perfectly to order. I actually just placed another order with them as I was starving and we needed something quick and cheap. Their prices are a *little* high on some dishes and about average on others. Expect a great deal of food though. You won't be hungry afterwards. I will warn that I think they use MSG. It's that ever hungry for more Chinese food thing when you eat their stuff. But it's TASTY so I kind of don't care. Give them a shot! Their website is actually very secure. I place my order right through there and they just call me when they get here!]
