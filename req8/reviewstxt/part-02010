[117801927064259207729,100263203620382559688,We had tried a number of personal tutors and tutoring centers over the years and were never terribly impressed with the results. It was my daughter who came across C2 Education in Paramus during her sophomore year of high school. The initial intent was to use C2 to prepare her for her SATs. From our first meeting with the center’s Director, we were impressed with C2’s approach of tailoring the study program to the student’s needs, matching student and tutor based on compatibility as well as the breadth of expertise available. We quickly realized that C2 Education offered much more than just SAT preparation. We began to see results almost immediately. My daughter quickly transitioned from a mediocre to an outstanding student. After seeing the results in my daughter, we decided to move her younger brother from “another” education center to C2 with similar results. My daughter is now successfully enjoying college and my son continues to improve as a sophomore in high school. We highly recommend C2 Education in Paramus. The results speak for themselves!]
