[113177173692040631896,100066474897529918017,Ryan is easy to work with in setting up an appointment and is very knowledgeable about the cars and maintenance of them. He freely answers any questions you have about what parts he uses and tells you why he uses them. It is because they provide better value and longer service. The shop is very clean and in watching him work on cars you can see he cares about what he is doing. If any fluids are involved he cleans up any spilled onto the car. He noticed that I used a zip tie to replace one of the plastic rivets BMW used and offered to replace it for free. This shop is out of my way but because of the value and level of service he provides I will be using him again for my service needs.]
