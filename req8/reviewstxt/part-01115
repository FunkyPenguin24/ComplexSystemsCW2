[111817426661480644732,100216532120709850930,Couldn't have been any easier, i had a box of files over 10 years old that i decided to purge so i stopped into the Fishers location and the staff were extremely friendly and professional. The charge for them to shred my documents was dirt cheap as well. This is a no brainer service if you have sensitive information you don't want to simply throw in the trash!]
