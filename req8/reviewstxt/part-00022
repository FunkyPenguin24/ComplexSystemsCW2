[100642818359966790916,100159845333039765767,I have had 2 car stereos installed by them about 5-6 years ago. The first was stolen out of me car a matter of weeks later. This by the way was a 1990 POS, with no indication on the outside that it had 5-700 dollars of stereo equipment in it. I have a hunch that the theft was most likely linked to the guy who installed it at Joo-Dee... Good or bad you can decide based off of that. The second install was all bad no matter how you look at it. First it took the guy about 3 hours to do a simple stereo/amp install, something I could do in less time and I am mechanically illiterate. During the process of finding a ground for the amp, the genius decided it would be a good idea to drill into the top of the gas tank. As if that wasn't enough when he tried to close the hood he forgot that he had left a tool under it. Then he proceeded to slam the hood once onto the tool, it didn't close, so he slammed it 3 or 4 more times before seeing it. This bent the hood so badly that it barely closed, instead of coming out and saying he messed up ( I saw him do all this) he tried to bend it back to true, which never happened. At this point I was a naive 17 year old, so I took it when the offered me to all the work for free (about $70 back then). But it took me hassling them to get even that. Run far away from this place!!]
