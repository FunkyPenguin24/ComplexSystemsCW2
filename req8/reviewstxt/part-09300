[100130239663477780063,100655539332649254491,I've been to lots of weddings over the years and Nathan is the best photographer I've come across. He has and incredible manner, always gets everyone grinning from ear to ear, always in the right place at the right time, and never in the way (in that annoying way that some photographers have!). That's why we got him to do our wedding earlier this year, and we couldn't be happier with the photos. Nathan, you're a legend, thank you!]
