[105461643094719235777,101144499170652151622,Primo's has never failed to get my order to me very quickly. The staff has always been very friendly and the pizza is some of the best in Carbondale. I would also rate their Calzones as some of the best I have ever had. My favorite thing about Primo's is the unique specialty pizza's they have I still have yet to come across one I don't like.]
