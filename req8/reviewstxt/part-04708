[105458621006109649622,100409379203505101469,DON'T Deal with Them, GO Directly to your creditor!! They will work with you, Trust me I know the game. Noll Collections Doing Business as NCS collections will probably change their name again. Spoke to John Cole, and he was extremely rude despite the fact I was trying to work something out so I can pay them back. I I understand that they probably deal with a lot of rude people so they no how to throw it back, but I wanted WORK it out because I support outsourced sales/marketing/collection. I'm all about customer service and I am easy to close but I just wanted to be treated like an adult. Anyways, I just called up the company I owed my money to and paid them directly without having to deal with rude people that are claiming to be "blunt" and laughing at me on the phone. John you are in sales so I know you are laughing on the outside but it stings so hard on the inside to lose that commission over something as simple this. Ha Ha Ha!]
