[108255683898718954744,100809684605389175376,The worst, CUSTOMER NO SERVICE explains them to a T, they continuously scam you into short term reasonably priced service and the minute your terms are up your prices shoot through the roof. CSR's will tell you anything you want to hear when you threaten to cancel but will stand behind nothing they say. your bills will continue to come at what ever rate they want to charge you. I disputed charges due to a number of promises and even a printed chat conversation where they agreed to credit my account and provided it to them. They still turned it over to collections and reported to the credit bureaus. they are gustapo's. They have a monopoly in our area and take advantage of it.]
