[101202062621621077768,100153715500991811272,My wife and I stayed here for two nights. The room we stayed in was excellent while not too expensive in USD (about $200/night), the hotel's restaurant was very good, and the hotel's service surpassed everywhere else my wife or I have stayed, in the US or abroad. If we make it back to Cappadocia, we'll definitely stay at this hotel again. Also, if you stay here and the opportunity arises during your stay for a tour of the hotel's property, take it... a hotel tour sounds like it is a gimmick, but it really is worth the 30 minutes at this historical location.]
