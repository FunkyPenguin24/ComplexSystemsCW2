[112198289170093495089,100413113681429993072,Genie Hookah is different from any other hookah bar. I love it because from the second you walk in the door you are treated like family. If you respect them they will respect you back. Other hookah bars are more concerned about making money than building a solid customer base. I have been coming here the last five years and I refuse to go anywhere else. Genie is the cheapest hookah lounge around and they offer a wide variety of flavors as well as a wide variety of drinks and chips. Rashid the owner is a total sweetheart and a personal friend of mine. Everyone that works here, as well as everyone that comes here are very friendly and make you feel like you are a part of the group. Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights are definitely the most busy so prepare yourself for a fun evening. There is music, dancing, games, and of course HOOKAH! I love you genie hookah.]
