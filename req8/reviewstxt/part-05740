[117012854669521518922,100463312857189329580,I had an appointment back in March. The place is tidy but very fashionable, I like the black and white color scheme. The staff isn't very large so if someone is in before you, you may have to wait. If you didn't bring a book or bring anything with you to pass the time, you can always watch Netflix. The chairs are very comfy, they don't hurt my back like most chairs. Since the staff isn't very big, there's more of a hands on touch. The doctor is very knowledgeable and it shows in her technique, I rarely ever felt any pain when instruments of different shapes were in my mouth. You get a bag of dental goodies afterwards. It was nice because I had no floss at home. Overall, I had a pleasant experience.]
