[108682076359785065081,100411953239911884321,I've lived here a month already and its just about prefect. my apartment is spacious, I feel incredibly safe here, tons of parking and everyone I've met has been friendly. yes maintenance takes time, but that's because there were only two maintenance meant for the entire complex, it's not their fault, it's management. the grounds are beautiful my apartment is so peaceful and my neighbors are quiet, it doesn't feel like an apartment it feels almost like a house or a condo I love it here.]
