[110117412838572320483,100010893839102362572,As of right now I am sitting on the toilet wondering why I had even thought of going to this so called "fancy" restaurant. I spent $16 on eight pieces of ravioli. I did the math. $2 a bite. @8 bites. Get real! Do not come here. Unless you have money to waste and like small servings and poor service... Oh and sitting on the toilet]
