[113853665030511628764,100592947859554868323,I recently purchased a Subaru outback from Eastside Subaru. I had done some research of the prices for my favorite model and also got some e-prices from several dealerships for several different options. Most of them were nice to reply me, but Mattew at Eastside Subaru was the one who very quickly replied me with most helpful information. When I stopped by the dealership, Mattew introduced me Brian. He also showed me several other cars which were in transit. Because I didn't want any package, he showed me the one including least options. Brian brought a good price for the car, which was less than I expected. He was very nice and responsible for his customer. After I bought the car, he gave me several phone calls to check whether I am enjoying my car and I have any concern for the new car. Because I had very terrible experience of purchasing my previous car, I was afraid of dealing with a car dealer. But Brian and Mattew made it so much easier. I am really satisfied with their customer service. I am not sure whether they were very nice to me because I just bought a car. :-) But I will recommend this dealership to my friends and be back to the dealership again if I will need another Subaru. Thank Mattew and Brian.]
