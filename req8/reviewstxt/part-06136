[113369282607316447076,100484679029748992492,unfortunately the service was awful, very long waits, many items did not arrive, and the restaurant was under staffed. All things considered, the staff worked hard to deliver and meet demand, but it was questionable whether this place is managed well. The washrooms and floors were disgusting to say the least. Food quality was moderate and prices are not awful.]
