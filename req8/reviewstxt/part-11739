[110202221362107953533,100787255052540649704,We recently ordered a Corvette through Gordon Chevrolet. the sales staff was awesome. We had many concerns about our order due to the complexity, but all worries were put to ease by the sales staff. They triple checked everything and even made calls to Chevrolet to make sure the car was going to be delivered as ordered. They also kept us up to date on the progress of our order at every turn. They made us feel very at ease and welcome. The Finance Dept was equally helpful. Finance had all of our paperwork in order and made everything very seamless. The cooperation between the different departments of the dealership was truly impressive. I highly recommend them if you are looking for a new car.]
