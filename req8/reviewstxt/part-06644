[109176247695955730142,100513496452077496740,The Comet Cleaners on Camp Bowie near Tom Thumb has managed to ruin and shrink every dress shirt I have. This adds up to thousands of dollars. I am very careful with my clothes. I have collected fine shirts over the years and taken good care of them. When I moved and could no longer use my regular cleaners, I tried Comet. My clothing kept getting smaller and smaller. The sleeves were drawn up, the shirts wouldn't button. They had not been dry clean but laundered. When I finally figured out it was not me and it WAS the clothes I took them back in. The woman working said that I should have tried the clothes on the day after I got them back. She did not offer to replace any of the shirts, accused me of telling her to dry clean them, and only offered to rerun them. Like that would help? Buyer beware, this is the worst experience I have ever had.]
