[106752664307515454497,100815205313269472010,What a pomp and ridiculous place the sites to see were all created just for the visitors. If you want to see sights, go downtown.. The entire place is secluded and isolated and yet you have to pay to park. Take me to the Fairmont, the Anatole, the crescent. You pay there but you can walk somewhere and its so much classier than the Gaylord. It looks nice but underneath its veneer is cheap particle board.]
