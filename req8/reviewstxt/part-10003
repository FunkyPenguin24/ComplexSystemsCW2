[116976950800497485944,100693550773316341049,I found this company to be extrememly frustrating. After receiving a quote that I found to be fair, I requested the tree removal to be scheduled. They were booked 2 weeks out, which at first was fine, and I was told I was slotted in the 8am appointment. The day before, when they called to ask how I was going to pay for the removal, I was told I had been moved to the Noon appointment. Fine, a little strange, but fine. The day of the appointment, at 2:30, I called to ask where they were and was informed by the scheduler that the previous appointment had added on a lot more work than what was contracted for and they would not be able to make my appointment. The girl said she would call me back after she looked at the calendar to reschedule. After 45 min, I called back and was advised she was still working with a supervisor to work something out. She called me back 10 min later to say the first they could reschedule me for would be the following Friday (a week later). I have never had a company noshow a job before and was completely bewildered that after having noshowed me they couldn't come for another week. I contacted another tree service, Empire Trees, they came out immediately, gave me a lower bid, and took down my tree within 2 days of my contacting them. I was really disappointed with the service I received from Diamond Trees and would definitely not recommend them to anyone, especially if you value your time.]
