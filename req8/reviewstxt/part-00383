[113659713525405236814,100179087325906609938,First off, It was nice to find a bike store open on a Sunday! Thanks for that as my Saturdays are filled with Floor Hockey and other items. My wife and I noticed a great price for a new Specialized Dolce Road Bike on the internet. I emailed and received a response within 12 hours! Not too shabby in today's world. We met Michael at the shop and he was very helpful in finding the right size and bike for my wife. The bike was purchased and assembled the same day. We met Sam(Owner) and his wife when we picked up the bike. It is great to see an owner that is so passionate about his work. I would highly recommend this store for your bike needs!]
