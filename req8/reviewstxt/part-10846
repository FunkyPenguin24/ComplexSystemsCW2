[114456406933403425552,100739284970628339893,I had LASIK here over the summer and I could not be happier with my experience. Not only are the results phenomenal but the entire process, from the first consultation to my most recent check-up (today), has been smooth and easy. Dr. Khanna and his entire office staff are professional, friendly, and accommodating. I would recommend Khanna Vision Institute to anyone considering LASIK - your vision is too valuable to trust just anyone and with Dr. Khanna you can rest assured that you are in great hands.]
