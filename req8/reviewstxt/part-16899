[110340346229436436936,101068921707745984530,This was my first visit to this dealership. I drove from Charleston to purchase a Nissan Cube that I saw on the internet. Not only were these employees super nice and helpful answering all of my silly questions through email and phone, they were exceptionally nice and easy to work with in person. Buying a car from out of state was a little stressful but Mark made it extremely easy and kinda fun. Mark was super nice and laid back...definitely not over the top "Sales-y." I really hate the pressure that you feel when you walk onto a car sales lot, I felt none of that at this place. It was super relaxed.]
