[105216459673787724846,101042346100180842894,I've ordered from Shangri-La about 7 or 8 times the past year when my sister and I are in the mood for Chinese Food. We just look up the menu online and call the restaurant to order the food. One thing that I dislike was the delivery person. He sort of expects a tip and I usually give him a couple of bucks, though he drove about half a mile to deliver the food and he sort of eyes you down for a tip. It's odd and sort of rude. The food however is delicious and well-prepared, better than most places. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking to order from somewhere new :)]
