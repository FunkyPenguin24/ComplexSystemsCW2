[104575877793955427085,100290836761868563612,I work for a small software company and we called Wire-Rite out for an estimate and they arrived almost immediately, were professional and courteous, and gave us an appointment to complete the installation of a few electrical outlets the very next day. They even arrived a bit early to do the work, which was fortuitous, as the unit we own is a former radiologists office, and Greg (the owner) discovered we had lead lined walls. This caused him and his helper to be here many hours beyond their initial quote and caused quite a bit more work than they initially expected. However, he only charged us slightly over estimate and stayed cool, calm, and collected during the entire frustrating situation. Greg was very professional and turned what could have been an expensive disaster into a painless experience for the company. We will continue to use Wire-Rite and VERY highly recommend them.]
