[114518225772490468352,100145084528083505452,I have visited this store often, and I have always been happy with the service and the knowledge of the staff. I think they work very hard to learn about the products they offer. The place has a great feel! One automatically feels better when walking in. It could be the friendly staff, the atmosphere, the incense they burn or just the energy of the place itself, but I usually feel much better after spending some time in the store. I have had a reading with one of the people they provide space for in their store. It was a very positive experience, and felt she really was gifted and she provided me with good information about myself and the possibilities of the future. I like the variety of products available at the store. From stones, incense, tarot decks, books, music, candles, jewelry and statue figures to some classes and of course the healer and readers... this is a pretty complete store and as mentioned in another review, if they don't have it, they can usually tell you where to find it. I will visit there often!]
