[102208555178564388018,100772513952381136515,Fantastic coaching. Especially when compared with larger chain gyms. Coaching that actually takes notice of you and tailors your training for you and your goals, whatever they may be. Always looks to train in a way that suits you in order to keep things interesting, too. Training here and following the principles set before me I've seen massive improvements in my strength and fitness levels. These are still continuing as I'll be looking to smash personal records within the coming week. Spacious and versatile making it perfect for any form of physical training you'd undertake. Plus it's always nice to not have to wait for a bar like I've had to in commercial chain gyms. I can't praise it enough, it's fantastic to come back here when I can.]
