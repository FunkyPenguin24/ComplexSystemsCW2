[100316440051276333322,100765830706574632322,Stand in a queue for 25 minutes to place your order for lunch (one poor girl dealing with a full lunch crowd), wait another hour for the meal to arrive - had to send dessert back because it came before the main course! Poor selection of wines by the glass and the only sparkling on offer was a sickly sweet Omni. The staff seemed to have an aversion to clearing away dirty dishes, every table was covered and clients had to stack them up out of the way so there was enough room for the next course. It was so bad we got the giggles.....]
