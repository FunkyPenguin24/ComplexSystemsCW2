[100041467280665159397,100287974844069006983,I have had nothing but excellent service in the past 4 years of coming here. I am shocked to see multiple poor reviews, and laugh that a majority are because they won't mount your discount tires. If you are willing to send money to big box companies out of state to save 8 bucks on a set of tires, then you should just mount them yourself. I work for a bicycle company and have to replace moped tires on a regular basis by hand (no easy task) and mike took the time to walk me through his process for doing tires with a tire iron without any problem. Maybe its because I work in the customer service industry and understand what it is like to have to put up with "holier than thou" types, but I have felt that every question answered by Mike has been nothing than helpful and professional. Mikes has fixed two of my bikes that have been down in the line of duty due to negligent drivers, and has done regular maintenance for me over the years, and treated me with respect. I do not feel their mechanic charges are more than the going rate, and I am one of the college student they supposedly try to fleece (one who works full time while attending school for the past seven years and works hard to enjoy their toys.) Mike, keep up the great work. The loyal customers that have come to you for years will do our best to keep up your great name.]
