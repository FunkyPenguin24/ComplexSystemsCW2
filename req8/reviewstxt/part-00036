[100206498788857357501,100160982361492058887,Good: they appear to do good work, they know what they are doing Bad: they make you wait a lot more often than not, they sometimes seem to do work that really isn't necessary and charge you for it, their billing and healthcare billing is entirely unacceptable and takes a large amount of effort to straighten out the bad appears for me, to out weigh the good. while i've been a patient for the last 3 years, i feel that they have been too focused on the money making and less on the patient care and experience to the point that i will not be going back.]
