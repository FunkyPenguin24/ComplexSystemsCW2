[100385300710427590956,101170180058976348393,Was not a big fan of this Resturant. The food was decent, but nothing to write home about. The atmosphere is really lacking, and the service is inconsistent. Dishes are small and expensive. Our main complaint was how much we spent. At a table for two, we spent about $100. Very, very overpriced for the experience delivered at this resturant.. We expected a nice romantic spot and got a place plainly furnished, with dirty tables and people from the bar smoking and drinking out front.]
