[102855509319349392236,100768929150131007314,I have moved many timesâ€¦some good and some nightmares. Moving with Fergusons was not only good, but enjoyable. They were easy to deal with right from my first contact with them. Their estimate was right bang on, they were always on time and they dealt with weird items (like a giant unpackable mirror) with no fuss or angst. Everything arrive in tact and was unloaded by very efficient and friendly men. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them, hands down, over their competition.]
