[108065590579892238828,101061771531016557570,I've heard great things about Premium Nissan, especially that their prices were fair. I was pleasantly surprised by the service of this dealership. I was in and out in a flash, and everything went smoothly. I traveled all the way in from North Jersey. These guys were on the ball! My salesperson Frankie Wells was fabulous. He knew everything there was about my new Altima. I had a small issue with not having an extra key which Nissan Corporate forgot to send. Thank God, Premium Nissan was competent enough to walk me through the particulars. The general manager Igor Tselnik actually contacted me twice to make sure that I was taken care of, and that my needs were attended. I will definitely go back to this dealership for future vehicles for my business and will recommend this dealership to my family and friends. I hope that Nissan Corporate appreciates these guys.]
