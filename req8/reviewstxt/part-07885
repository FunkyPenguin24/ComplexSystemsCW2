[118318433154089519779,100581602341940025201,Posted for Charles N. Swafford, Jr. - I have been in the auction and real estate business for 44 years and have closed real estate transactions ith dozens of attorneys here in Madison County, plus all adjoining counties. One of the most important things that I look for in an attorney's office, besides the actual closing, is the help from the office staff. They can either make a realtor look good or bad to their clients. Martinson & Beason's staff is courteous and gives the assistance you need prior to the closing. Receiving telephone calls is a large part of a realtor's livelihood and Martinson & Beason is always available for their clients. I rate Doug and Mac Martinson and their staff at the top of their profession. If I were to choose a law office today to handle any real estate transaction, it would be them.]
