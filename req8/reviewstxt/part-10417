[100058360503780913901,100716089605542832060,Great Vet! We acquired a cat from a neighbor. He had been neutered at Dr. Dan's 3 years ago so we took him there for his rabies and temperament shots. Great friendly staff that are "Pet People" as i like to call em. We have another aging cat that had lost weight and was not looking too good. We were so impressed with Dr. Dan and staff that we made an appointment for our 2nd cat "Monday." We found out she had a liver problem after doing blood work. Dr. Dan gave her an antibiotic and some other medicine, plus a vitamin supplement. Were happy to say she is doing well. Our special thanks to a great veterinarian! I should point out that Monday used to have a good vet whose company was bought out by another. We got the impression that they were too big to provide quality personalized care. I'm glad we found Dr. Dan and staff!]
