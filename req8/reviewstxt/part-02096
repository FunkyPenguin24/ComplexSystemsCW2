[102589380850643529884,100267524765718892283,They have a big selection of cars but thats it. You are just a number. They dont care about the customers and always try to sell for sticker price. They have tried to sell me a car while waiting for an oil change. The worst part is they tried to sell me a car when I got into an accident and went there to ask something about my gap insurance. They are horrible. They should include an option for zero stars.]
