He was informative, up front and catered to our every need. This is my second purchase at Hawkinson Kia and it was just as good as the first time. We were even recommending more people as soon as we got home with our new car. Which is a 2013 Kia Optima. Absolutely love it! Everyone at this dealership is extremely friendly and very helpful. Fun place to be at while you are waiting. Even the other salesman were helping and talking to us between their customer's. We never felt forgotten or neglected. Excellent kudos to William and Hawkinson Kia.]
