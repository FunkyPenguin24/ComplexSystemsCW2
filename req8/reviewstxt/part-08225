[104524831866781230724,100600049905268376249,The folks at work ordered from here for my birthday lunch. The food was outstanding! I usually review based on service, and I can't speak to that this time around because I wasn't there. I had the pork belly sandwich and it was flavorful, great textures and delicious bread. Everyone else enjoyed their food as well.]
