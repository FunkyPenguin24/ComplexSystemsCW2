[115798847813231296119,100659873973360061998,I live in the opposite part of town but make a point to visit the Tuck Shop at least once a week, if I lived closer it might be a daily visit. Food is delicious, home made, prices really beyond reasonable and service with a smile. What more could you ask for?]
