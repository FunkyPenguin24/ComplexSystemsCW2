What to do, who to call, checked Goggle found the name "Father & Son" and said why not. Called first thing Monday monring figured it would be a day or so but 2.5 hours later Dan and his son in-law Mike was there to save the day as that is what happened, 30 mins later it was fixed and at a price that was unbeleibe able. Thanks Dan and Mike your name is your bond, thanks. God forbid but if anything else goes wrong, I got your number...Dave]
