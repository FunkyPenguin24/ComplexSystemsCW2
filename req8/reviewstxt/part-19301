[107324658714277914846,100022823946126440998,I dread going to the dentist more than anything in the world. But if I have to go to the dentist, I want it to be Thanksgiving Point Dental. The staff was helpful and friendly. They let me watch TV while they worked on my teeth. And my dentist was super nice.]
