[103636101884776191538,100214156410030635868,My girlfriend and I decided to go for the first time and I would say she was more disappointed than I was, simply because too many penny slots and not enough other increment slots. I agree with her. It is a nice, clean place and very interesting atmosphere though. So...if you enjoy the penny slots then this is your place to go! I still prefer Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland. :)]
