[109488622811282155309,101042017518657643860,I was sold the moment I walked in and saw one of the cooks impaling marinated chicken pieces on a skewer and putting it into the Tandoor. None of the MKE restaurants have a tandoor so that makes this place the best Indian eatery north of Schaumburg. We ordered Mango martini, Chicken tikka (appetizer), Lamb masala and chicken karahi. Keep reading if you want to know more. Mango martini- For an indian restaurant it was pretty good. Chicken tikka- REALLY GOOD. Reminded me of the dhaba's in India Lamb masala- The sauce was great but the lamb meat wasn't the best, considering good lamb or goat is har to find in MKE, I don't blame the owners, who would drive everyday to chicago to get the fresh lamb meat. Chicken karahi- loved the sauce and the presentation. Overall the most authentic indian restaurant in MKE. ************************************ To the owners- Cut the chicken peices smaller in your dishes to better absorb the sauce and don't cut corners by only using thigh or leg meat, some of us enjoy white/mixed meat.]
