[102794578648061971980,100392181607133665887,I bought a 2008 Camry from AutosDirectOnline which is not only clean and has a low mileage, but also one of the cheapest cars I found that week in the nation. When I went on person to see the car I found it as was described online so I drove it home from Ohio to Michigan that day. The staff was friendly and the purchasing process was pretty much swift and smooth.]
