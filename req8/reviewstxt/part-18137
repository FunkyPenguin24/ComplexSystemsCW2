[102676014895953237381,101137753443444619050,I moved to North Knoxville 2 years ago knowing not a soul or any recommendations for a hair salon. My experience has been polar opposite to the reviews above. Always able to get an appointment, especially last minute, for which I am notorious. Wonderful hair stylists who make my hair look fantastic, reasonable prices and friendly, professional staff. They always make me feel welcome and chat with me while they are fixing my hair. Would recommend this salon to anyone!]
