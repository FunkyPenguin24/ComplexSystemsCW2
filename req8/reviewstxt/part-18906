[117026829997956273455,100001489400115838042,My husband and I have dined at Randall's several times. We have not been disappointed ONCE. The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I highly recommend the Lobster Fran√ßaise...with Vanilla Creme Brulee for dessert. The staff at Randall's is friendly & professional. They are educated on all of the menu items (for those like me who have questions) and always give you a full description of the specials. On a scale from 1-10...I would have to give Randall's & the Randall's staff an easy 12. By far my favorite restaurant in Lehigh Valley.]
