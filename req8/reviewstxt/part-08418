[101957545308763592126,100609710129844011070,Went on Sunday, March 2, 2014, 6:30-8:15 P.M. Got a table fairly quickly as the restaurant was about 1/3 full. Took around 15 min for waiter to get our drink order. Took another 20 minutes to get our food order. Took another 35-40 minutes to get our food. I had the meatball dish. Tasted bland and had what seemed like 2 cans of mushrooms in it. Never got a refill on drinks. Took the waiter another 15 minutes after we finished to bring the check. First time there and wasn't impressed at all.]
