[102089313420729985748,100824031725287415977,I had a terrific visit at the Garland park with my niece and nephew. The park was clean, the bathrooms were clean and smelled nice, and we had a lot of fun on the various slides. I was impressed by the friendliness of the staff, who went out of their way to help. While I was at the wave pool, a lifeguard saw a boy in trouble, and I was amazed at how fast everyone reacted. The horn blew to stop the waves, two lifeguards were in the water while a third kept watch on the pool, and a man in an EMT shirt was there immediately. The only fault I find is that the uncovered sidewalks are too hot for bare feet. I have no other complaints and expect to go back many times.]
