[105705606658210190824,100078543324082734381,Our Miele canister stopped working, of coarse at the worst possible time. We had family over and needed to get the house cleaned. With no appointment, i dropped by this store . I met the manager Alex, and he understood our situation and offered to loan us a vacuum while he fixed ours. That was very nice of him, fortunately we could wait til the next day. This is a great place to have in Ventura. Very small town feel with great service.]
