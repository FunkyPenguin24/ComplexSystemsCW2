[104454153652439795188,100857563976094726476,Welllllll, I had pretty bad teeth growing up and it wasn't until I was about 16 my parents finally got the message that I needed braces. So we came here (mainly out of convenience) and, well, pretty much everything was awesome. The staff are extremely friendly - knew you by name and face - and were always ready to help you out. They were always readily available and knew exactly what they were doing. It's never too busy (e.g., they've never overbooked on appointments) so your wait time in the lobby is about five minutes at the longest, and once you're in the chair, it seemed to me like smooth sailing - in and out in half an hour many times. Never felt any pain in my mouth while they worked on my braces (and to boot, the Christian radio they have playing always seems to relax me). Anyways, it was pretty awesome here. Never understood why others would whine about going to the orthodontist's because, honestly, this place is really amazing. :)]
