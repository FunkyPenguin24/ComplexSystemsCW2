[100086443540026584807,100346097514633513634,If you love to dig through piles of stuff, question what the prices are and never get service this is the place for you. This place is filled with some cool stuff but even more junk. The prices are a little high and I have never found the staff helpful. The one upside is the lumber dept, if you can find something that isn't already sold you will have some amazing reclaimed lumber.]
