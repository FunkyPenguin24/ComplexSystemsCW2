[110329330455446950062,100041680302074638451,By all standards, Marcus Lemonis is a mensch - because I would have punched this guy Hank right on the air for all to see. Hank's mother should be ashamed of herself - if she had any respect for her late husband she would immediately fire her jerk of a son. I would go as far as to say I wouldn't even hire Hank as a janitor. I am embarrassed for the employees to have to work for this idiot.]
