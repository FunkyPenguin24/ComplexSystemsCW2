[105361316128135696467,100793297706762299125,I just spent the weekend at the Red Clover on a "girls getaway" with eight of my closest friends. What a great time we had! The Inn itself is beautiful. The staff are excellent--they took care of anything we asked for, and the food was terrific. Snow-shoeing, cross country skiing and downhill are all just a few miles away, but we were all so happy to return to the Inn at night. We ate one dinner on the casual side of the restaurant and the next we sat on the more formal side and did a "chef's tasting" with each course matched with the perfect wine--a definite recommendation! This place was great for a group and would be a romantic setting for couples as well.]
