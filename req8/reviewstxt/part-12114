[105228471197262727807,100807184489561020331,I have always liked this sushi bar. I had a nice selection of sushi rolls, sashimi and nigori tonight and everything was spot on. I've never been disappointed here. I worry that the last few times I've been here the restaurant has not been very crowded. Its a favorite place of mine]
