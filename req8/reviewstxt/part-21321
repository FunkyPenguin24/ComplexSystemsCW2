[104308483599133297296,100130162916284662209,My wedding was held at the Semple Mansion just this passed Friday, 9/20/13, and let me just say....WOW! My husband & I could not have been more pleased! The space is absolutely breathtaking and all of our guests were blown away by its beauty and could not stop complimenting us on our choice of venue. Katherine, the in house coordinator, was a pleasure to work with and was always willing to help with anything needed! The Grand Foyer, where we held the ceremony, is beautifully decorated with crystal chandeliers that hang from the ceiling that add such a magnificent detail to the room. The dark woodwork is simply beautiful and gives the space a warm & rich look and feel that is absolutely stunning! The newly added Library room across from the Copper Lounge bar is a great place for guests to relax and mingle during social hour as well as just being a unique space for guests to enjoy the ambiance. Our day went by without any mishaps and was an absolute dream come true. If we had to do it all over again, my husband & I know we would choose Semple Mansion as our venue every time!]
