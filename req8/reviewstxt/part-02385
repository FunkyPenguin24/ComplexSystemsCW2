[100482510006164043043,100281714488037541847,Recently had one of the old pipes above my dining room burst, and they just said its common with old properties and that it happened across the street a few days back. After having it take two weeks for them to fix my bathroom sink, and a flooded dining room/kitchen, they refused to even consider any concessions. The apartment is in decent condition for an old property, aside from the noise factor. The hot water is red, probably from rust, for a while. The staff is nice, but the property manager is an absolute jerk. Unprofessionally rude and sloppy, which doesn't help the image of the complex. I have actually seen him wonder around with a 12" gash in his pants... and he is the manager! Finally, the apartment staff recently claimed that they returned a check of mine because it was not the exact price, but never did. In fact, it the court order was the first time I was even hearing about the issue. If they would have actually just contacted me through proper channels, none of it would have been an issue, but apparently nothing they do is conventional. Aside from good locale and decent rates, there is not much reason to want to live here.]
