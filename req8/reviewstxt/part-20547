[106658808453988767926,100088026580023658025,My wife and I stayed here the first time this summer and found it to be a very nice motel. The room was clean, large and had a great view out our second story window of the wheat plains and mountains. Everything about our stay was great and we will plan on staying here again when traveling through Montana.]
