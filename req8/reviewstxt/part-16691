[101156265759220427204,101058407299096197518,Why have I given them such an excellent rating? They’ve earned it the old-school way. They use honesty, dedication and hard work to make their customers happy. I began calling upon the services of this dealership, immediately after moving to Huntsville from Schaumburg Illinois in April of 2003. They began servicing our two Ford Vehicles that we brought down from Illinois. My wife and I have always had and we still have all of our service work done here on our two current Ford Vehicles. The Service Director, Pat Carroll is fantastic. His dedication to complete customer care and satisfaction is always evident. His integrity and ethics are passed on to the customers through via the efforts and personalities of his excellent team of Service Advisors and Technicians. Our requested advisor is Erica Ortiz. She is very pleasant, professionally polished and communicates extremely well. If you ever need parts (because warranties do expire), Jeff Waddell is a specialist who is excellent in every sense of the word. We have purchased 3 New Ford Vehicles from this Dealership in the past 4 years. The most recent was yesterday 9/06/12. Our salesperson, Sally Rochelle, made yesterday's buying experience the best that we've had in over a decade. Sally is very pleasant, honest, polished, forthright and knowledgeable. She’s an excellent listener and truly has your best interest at heart. I highly recommend this dealership and the wonderful people that work therein.]
