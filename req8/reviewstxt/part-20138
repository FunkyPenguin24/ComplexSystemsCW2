[101067941117832173628,100067624812035845779,I had eaten at Sugar 'n Spice before, but had only gotten the burger as I normally do when I am uncertain of the quality of the food. Today I was looking for something different. So, I asked my wife who was born and raised in Spartanburg where we should go. Sugar n' Spice was the choice. The outside looks like a 50's drive-in, they still have the drive up area, but it does not appear to be utilized anymore. The inside is a little dated and they could use some new covers on there chairs. But the decor really goes with the feel of the place. I ordered the souvlaki which came with a side of fried, coleslaw and a slice of toast. The souvlaki smelled great and I had high hopes, but after taking my first bite I was totally overwhelmed by the amount of seasoning. I would love to try the same flavor with about 80% less seasoning and cooked medium as opposed to well done. But, I am not sure if a souvlaki is supposed to be this way or not. The coleslaw was ok and the fries were good but not great. You can get onion rings and fries, but I have to avoid the onions. I am not saying avoid this place, but be careful ordering the souvlaki unless you love A LOT of seasoning. Think I will get the burger again the next time the wife wants Sugar n' Spice.]
