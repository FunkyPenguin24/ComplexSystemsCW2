[112635690409533478321,100251146268977524040,We hosted a reception for about 30 work colleagues from around the world on the indoor bocce ball court last night. The food, the service everything was excellent! Four of us liked the reception food so much, we decided to stay and have dinner. Totally amazing! Great salads, pasta and entrees. Thank you to the folks at La Scala for making our event a success, our evening wonderful, and our dinner delightful. We will be back. Mark J. Spalding, President, The Ocean Foundation]
