[108666916285341996276,100163177768151218641,I have been a customer at Fitzgerald for 10+ years. For car purchases, service, repairs, bodywork, etc. We had built a relationship of trust. I am sorry to say at my last visit I believe I was cheated and therefore overcharged for break work. With 2% of my pads remaining I was told both my front breaks and routers needed to be replaced. Because I have trusted and received such good service in the past I approved the repair. But with further review with friends in the know there were less expensive options they could have offered. I believe I have been taken advantage of, and for this reason I am giving a 1 star rating.]
