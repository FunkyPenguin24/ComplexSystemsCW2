[109858267545516700352,100772259164953559292,Lame. Went because Newport Beach OSF is one of my favorite restaurants. This one needs help. Tuesday night, our waiter was scared, food took forever, do did my second glass of wine. When our salads came at 45minutes we were ready to leave and choose a different restaurants. We ordered gluten free pasta (I know dumb) but they literally sent manager to tell us they were "cooking up a new batch" we got it 30 min later. The waiter walked by me 4 times and never looked over before I said "check" irritated. He didn't even ask about the included dessert that we were passing on any way just hurried the check across the table top and bolted. I wish I had talked to the manager again. My 3,5,and 6 year old daughters were ready to fire him and the server. We won't be back with so many better choices when we're on town.]
