[111618648579861151640,100269939686687143674,I called to make an appointment with David's Bridal, for a Saturday. The associate told me that Saturdays tend to be a zoo, and asked if a Friday would work for me. A Friday appointment was fine, especially since they worked around my schedule, and I was allowed to bring who and however many people I wanted to (I was told at other dress shops that I could only bring __ people, or no kids, etc..). My appointment was made for Friday at 7pm. I was treated very nicely the whole time I was there, and my sales girl was very patient with me, as I can be a bit indecisive at times. I ended up finding my dream dress! The store associates were very helpful, and ever allowed us to stay after hours to make sure we found everything we needed/wanted. I would definitely recommend!!]
