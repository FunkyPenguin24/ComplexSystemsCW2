[108241518269361331001,100732894518959315300,I have nothing but positive things to say about Consolidated Home Repair. Chris was a complete professional and the work he completed on my home far exceeded my expectations. He is a perfectionist and it shows. My neighbors now want him to do work for them as well. I wouldn't hesitate to give him a call if you need an outstanding contractor in the Raleigh area. Good help is hard to find, but that's what you'll get with Chris. Update: Had Chris come back out and fix a couple other issues for me. Super nice guy and very astute at problem solving. I can't speak highly enough about the work he's done for me.]
