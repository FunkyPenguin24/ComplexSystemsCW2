[105112252960745921097,100428844196154000449,Really Simple BUT Good & "Cheap" Asian/Island (American) style food...they have a Great Location as far as Neptune Beach distance! About 2 minutes away (walking) But Parking is Limited since there is a Hotel right in front and next to this Restaurant. I've personally gone twice now with my Pregnant GF and we both have had no compliants. So based on what we ate, I'd say it's a Must-try if your anywhere near there visiting the beach. Also they are Open from the Afternoon and stay Open until 9pm. Usually by the time the Sun goes down ;) Perfect Snack, Lunchz or Dinner]
