[106007171109058712097,100478121318006861755,Honestly, we love it here. Everyone in the office goes above and beyond whenever we need something, maintenance is usually very prompt. The landscaping is beautiful, and they do an excellent job keeping it that way. The location is excellent - being able to walk to Ybor is a definite bonus - and the neighborhood isn't as bad as some reviewers have made it out to be. The pool is well maintained and resident access only ( no worries about neighborhood kids jumping in) and there is on site security at night and on the weekends. We rented here sight unseen from out of state, and I'm glad we did!]
