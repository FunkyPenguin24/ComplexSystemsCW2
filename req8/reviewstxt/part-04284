[106293989367220702162,100386369762531071881,I was shopping for a new 2013 Sonata and emailed 6 different DFW area Hyundai dealers to get their best price. Luis with South Dallas Hyundai came back with the lowest price and it was his best price the first time, no back and forth. The other dealers kept coming down, but they still couldn't beat South Dallas' price. I figured that South Dallas must be running some kind of gimic or hiding the price somewhere else, but when I got out there and had the numbers on paper, they matched exactly what I was told over the phone/email. South Dallas doesn't do any forced dealer add-ons like pin-striping or "paint protectant" like some of the other dealers. They just sell you the car you want at a fair price. I would highly recommend them and will go back to them, even though I drove past 3 other Hyundai dealers to get to them.]
