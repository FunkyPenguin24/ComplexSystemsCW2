[102619659153441449203,100583100743792311475,My husband & I have been long time Lowes members and have had only good experiences with Lowe's products and service until tonight. We entered the Greenland store a little before 9:00PM Saturday night to purchase a plant and get some brochures for a kitchen remake of our counters. We had some questions about counter materials. We passed many people working in the kitchen department and other departments and no one asked us if we needed help or said anything to us that they would be closing soon. We found some samples and picked up some brochures along with a plant that we wanted to buy. We were in the store for at least 1/2 an hour before an employee came and told us that they were closing the store and all registers were closed and we were escorted out. We never heard a closing announcement. We felt invisible and ignored and we were not able to purchase the plant. Very bad service.]
