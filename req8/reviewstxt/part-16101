[117875841157205959315,101026233623876669870,I spent a full day looking at every SUV and truck on all the websites. Building my perfect car with all the options I wanted. Problem being the price was always just to high. We hit a couple of other dealers before ending up at Jeff D'Ambrosio. I like that I wasn't attacked on the lot when we started to browse Big Plus. As soon as we were ready for help someone from Jeff directed us to Brook Donahue. Great guy, he helped us make a decision between the Jeep Cherokee TrailHawk and the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. He didn't push us either way, just brought out both cars and gave us all the info we could ask for. Its nice not to be forced into something when making a big 5+ year decision. We ended up going with the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and are very happy with it. They gave us a great trade in value on our Sante Fe right on par with Kelly Blue Book. And an even better price on the Jeep Wranlger. Didn't think we would be able to get the Sahara. The online build price was at the upper limit of our budget. Overall very impressed, great service and people. Definitely 5 stars in my book!!!!]
