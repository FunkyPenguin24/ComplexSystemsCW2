[103914061568718731667,101153461306296989470,Drove cross country from Mass to California. I was lucky enough to have found the Jack London Lodge on Groupon. It was one of the nicest places we stayed at on our entire three week trip. The woman at the front desk was very friendly. The beds were extremely comfortable and clean. The room was immaculate. I cant say enough about how nice it was and very close to the wineries! A diamond in the rough for sure!]
