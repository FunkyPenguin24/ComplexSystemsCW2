[107767953072648157683,100983240740553152440,Don't use these inspectors. I am selling a house and they did the inspection. When they listed the problems with the house, they said the hall shower diverter was not functioning. I called the plumber out to fix the problem but the diverter was fine. So I paid $75 for a plumber for no reason. The kicker to the story is that the MASTER shower diverter is actually bad and they wrote the wrong room on the inspection. When I called to get them to pay the $75 I wasted on the original plumber visit, I was told by the owner "No". Why not? They made a fundamental error and they should make up for it.]
