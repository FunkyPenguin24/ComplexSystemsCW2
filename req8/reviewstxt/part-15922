[104681682667878488172,101016718710987384245,Horrible! I will never go back! Staff was rude and lacked personality. The service is substandard and so very slow. There is absolutely no organization or direction whatsoever. Their BOGO special is false advertisement. Staff doesn't follow posted hours. They were supposed to be open until 7 pm, I arrived at 6:05 pm and the door was locked. A staff member was at the front counter but would not open the door, saying they closed at 6. No cheaper than other Optometry offices. Don't waste your time!]
