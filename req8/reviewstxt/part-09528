[117519371262555849867,100667275274519065110,Run away. The Pizza is terrible. I mean nasty. The worst I've ever had anywhere, including grocery store, carnival, buffet, etc. I had to check decor and service to publish this review, but I've never been to the store: so ignore those ratings. If the Pizza stinks, who cares about the Decor or service anyway.]
