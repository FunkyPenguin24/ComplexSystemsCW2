[103022746167022711091,100542468695321641521,Totally unprofessional. Showed up at 8:30am for my jump at 9am. A few instructors didn't show up. We didn't jump until after 12. We ended up waiting over 3 hours to jump while the staff was playing frisbee and smoking cigarettes. Nobody was apologetic and most of the staff smelt like alcohol. Once we actually got to jump the jump was great but the facilities and the staff were not.]
