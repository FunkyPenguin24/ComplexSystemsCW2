[113974435617678700793,100670306371777450227,I hurt my back and tried everything to help - exercises, muscle rubs and even anti-inflammatory and muscle relaxant medications. Nothing helped and I was still in agony. Then I went to Ashley at Awaken and after the very first massage I noticed a big difference. She worked with me for a couple of months and my back has been great ever since! I have sent several friends and co-workers to Awaken and everyone has loved the care they have been given! Great people, great skill and great service!]
