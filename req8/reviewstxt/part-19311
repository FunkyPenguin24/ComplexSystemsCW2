[100142608812866958965,100023366950410484090,I recently had the Dinner Diva cook dinner for 5 of my best friends. It was so much fun and of course, the good was amazing! Mary showed up at our house and brought in all of her kitchen goodies. Then she got busy cooking! She made us an awesome appetizer and sangria. Then for dinner, she made us braised short ribs, polenta and grilled veggies. It was all amazing but the dessert was other worldly. Chocolate souffle cakes. It's so much fun to hire Mary to come and cook dinner for a special occasion, but she can also cook for your family so you have healthy dinners all week long. She has a fabulous set of recipes she can pull from and is an awesome chef. thanks Mary!]
