[100382123814148105028,100055884108647721842,Worst dining experience ever! Saturday Night at 7pm. Waited 30 min.. to seat a group of 15 in a half empty restaurant. 1 hour just to get our salads,[], had to order drinks 3 times to get them. My meal was the New York Strip for 17.99. The steak was obviously from the freezer. Also, an hour after ordering we were told they were out of meatballs, potato soup and only had 1 Ribeye. One of the kids with us had his pizza completely forgotten. When we complained to the manager he really didn't care. Avoid this place. 2.5 hours of my life wasted for bad service and really bad food!]
