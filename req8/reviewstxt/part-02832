[113247902574477588776,100304951871907985600,JOSHUA COCKERAM!!! Spent several hours at Dick's Mackenzie Ford today with Sales Associate Joshua Cockeram. Best time I've ever spent at an auto dealership. Joshua showed me several autos and went through the new 2014 Fusion from top to bottom. This guy really knows his stuff. Very professional. I'm 66 years old and my first impression caused me to think he was too young and inexperienced. Boy was I wrong. I didn't buy today, but I had no intentions of doing so when I arrived. However, if my decision is to finally buy a Ford product, I will buy from that dealership, if not from Joshua. Bravo!]
