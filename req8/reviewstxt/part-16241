[106089184038911001389,101033606429952279747,Amazing atmosphere, very welcoming, fish the cat is just a cool character and the land lady (I think her name is linke) was the nicest person ever, she even let us store our bags in her friends studio on our last day. I advise anyone travelling to Amsterdam to pay a visit, cheap beer, great food and full of locals which means it's got their sign of approval. I'll be going there next time I go! Paul]
