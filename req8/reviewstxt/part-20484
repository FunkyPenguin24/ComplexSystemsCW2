[100397938379546977314,100085019135577730589,Would not have know about this place unless it was for google. Located right down on the waters edge. Lots and lots of stairs to get to this place so if you canâ€™t use them get a boat in. The food was good. Had the fish and chips. The serving was huge. The dressing on the salad was not so nice.The staff are friendly and helpful.]
