[102906214353824346776,101033244406555020893,Stopped by here, wanted to try them out, always see the parking lot full. This place is amazing, from the outside decor to the plates on your table to the color bottle display and fireplace in the bar area. The food was excellent, cooked and prepared just the way we asked for it. Our waiter Sean P. did and outstanding job, far out-ceded our expectations. We will definitely be dining here again.]
