[101933701951527280719,100718564631265397988,I have been a vocal student of Saul Fox for about a year now. I thought I had a pretty good voice when I went to see him, but I soon realized I had not even scratched the surface of what was possible. Saul is one of the best teachers I've had in any discipline. He challenges you to work hard and go beyond what you think you are capable of doing. He is always positive and encouraging while making clear what areas need more work. Saul always knows what songs to teach you to complement your particular voice and maximize your strengths. Also, he provides opportunities to perform and develop your confidence in front of a live audience. If you have a desire to perform someday as a singer, I highly recommend you give Saul Fox a try.
