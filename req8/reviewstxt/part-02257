[102580544358019004019,100275760717580137705,I want to say that I'm sorry this place is closed, but the one time I ate there it almost killed my girlfriend at the time. You may assume I'm exaggerating, but I'm not so sure. You see, she had this clam chowder soup which was kind of not so warm and all that, and not long afterward she got this crazy, crazy high fever which lasted for days. Scary stuff.]
