[110882895443368736838,100218755342886126420,First off Brian is not only an outstanding Attorney, but an amazing human being! He is kind, compassionate, and understanding. From the very moment I met with Brian I knew I was in excellent hands! His knowledge of the law is second to none and he is really slick. My case was not a big money maker in any way, but this did not deter Brian from treating it with the utmost importance. He gave me his cell and always returned my calls promptly. I felt like we were old friends rather than client and attorney. I was facing very serious felony charges and Brian got me ARD! If your life is in the hands of the court do not hesitate to call him!]
