[106969614735144649528,100807464512270850233,I wrote THIS personal email to Cody at EDC. I wanted to share it as my review because it is not everyday that you can email someone and have him respond in such a personal and professional manner: Happy Holidays to you Cody, I never had the chance to truly thank you for the help and insight you gave during my brief time over at EDC upgrading my wife's ring. I was the guy with the twins if you remember? Obviously, via this email address, I work in the Arts at UD... anyway, you were such a champ man and my wife is finally getting a chance to wear it after the birth of our daughter. Its gorgeous and I am ecstatic (as is she). Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you to you and the entire EDC family..... As you can see, the personal touch was amazing and the sharing of each others time and information made the experience flawless.]
