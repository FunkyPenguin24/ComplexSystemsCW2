[111960579219740685566,100318716581564222528,My Favorite Gallery in Asheville, bar none. Christin, the gallery owner, surprised me. At first I thought she was just a sales-girl; I just started talking with her and found her very helpful, and she was a good listener. The Mix is very eclectic. There were several great glass artists that caught my eye, and they had a very nice collection of my favorite: Raku. I ended up getting two beautiful paintings,.which she shipped to my house for me. This will be my first stop next time I am in Asheville!]
