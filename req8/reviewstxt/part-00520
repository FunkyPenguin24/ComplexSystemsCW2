It was about 10 euros (less if you're a student), and there wasn't a time limit. Free tea, coffee, and water was offered. You could also buy some soft drinks and snacks, if you wanted to. It wasn't overly crowded, which was nice. There are spacious lockers available, that were included in the price. Two showers were also available. It was just a nice friendly atmosphere. You could even walk out into a secluded little patio, and cool down in between sessions. No one there stares at you either. It's very Finnish. It's also not an electrical sauna, so it feels a lot more natural. The man that was running the place speaks excellent English as well. I highly recommend!]
