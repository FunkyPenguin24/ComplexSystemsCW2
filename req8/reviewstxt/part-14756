[115313771473336511661,100953523490939728195,I've been going to this Chipotle a lot over the past year but recently (past 5-10 trips) the portions have changed substantially and not for the better (mainly the rice and meats). I'm not sure if this is due to a new company policy or the fact that the staff has changed. I'm paying the same amount of money as before, except now I only receive half of the amount of food. I've even said something to the staff, such as can I have more rice or more meat. For the rice they gave me about a quarter of a scoop more (at the most) and for the meat I was told I would have to pay double, however I used to get double this amount in the past and was never told I had to pay more. It's come to the point where I don't plan on going back, which is kinda sad as this used to be my favorite place to go for lunch.]
