[100720545235684365721,100426741340713242697,I contacted the service department to price having a door handle replaced and was quoted a price for parts and labor. After confirming that price, the service writer told me to stop by to have the part ordered. When I stopped in to the service department, I encountered a VERY rude valet and a service writer who could not be bothered to help me so he told me to talk to the parts department. The parts department gave me a much higher price on the part and when I questioned the discrepancy, he rudely told me to go talk to the service writer. This service department is staffed by the most rude, arrogant, and condescending people. I will not be returning.]
