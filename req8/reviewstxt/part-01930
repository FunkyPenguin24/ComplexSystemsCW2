[102683591095416633270,100258563968758692079,Mobile Shooting Center is the best in town, and for a long distance outside of town. Their prices are consistently lower than anyone else nearly 100% of the time (on firearms), their staff are very helpful, and know a great deal, and they are the nicest folks you'd every want to meet. One anonymous poster here talked about buying a "new" firearm, and it was 2 years old... Well, you can also go to a car dealer and get last year's car. Still new. I would imagine that person got an excellent deal. These people are not dishonest in any way. I have never - ever - had any issues with them. They have always stood behind everything I ever got from them, and they even help me with items I got before I knew about them. They even helped me fix a gun that I broke (and I mean _I_ broke it, through my own stupidity), and they didn't charge me anything other than their hard costs. (Shipping to the OEM.) I have bought at least 1/2 dozen firearms from them in the last few years, and they are 100% on all of them.]
