[116006930310251266170,100924433139502006724,My experience at Burnside has been nothing but positive. I have been going to the clinic on and off for various injuries for about 8 years (competitive sports will do that to you!), and they are always positive and resolve my issues in a matter of a few visits. The reception staff are also very helpful when it comes to both booking appointments and clarifying any questions I have regarding claims. My most recent injury Joy helped me using IMS techniques and by the time I left the clinic I was already feeling better!! The staff are knowledgeable and kind, and I would highly recommend this physio!]
