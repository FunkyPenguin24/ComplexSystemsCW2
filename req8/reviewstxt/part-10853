[110489233135617311091,100739522433886256948,This was the first time we've eaten here, so my husband and I were going to share one bowl. The visit didn't start off well when the waiter read me the riot act about sharing a bowl as if we were trying to get away with something. So I felt obligated to order an appetizer as well even though I didn't really want that much food. He then took me over to all the raw ingredients (including raw meat that looks just nasty sitting there) which were set up buffet style and showed me recipe cards I could follow if I wanted. Well, if I wanted to follow a recipe or figure out what food goes well with other food and how to season it, I'd save money, stay home and cook it myself. I go out to eat so I don't have to do those things, as figuring out how to season meat leaves me in a complete state of panic, which is why I love making salads... I ended up putting something together that was edible, but I was so stressed about what they heck I was doing, I was not hungry by the time the food came to the table. I was also put off by the fact that there were several signs to tip both the servers and the "Grill Masters". Not quite sure why when the patrons "get" to put the ingredients together themselves. I would NOT recommend Genghis Grill to a friend, I'd tell them to eat at home instead and save themselves some money.]
