[101005819128392572814,100418303045755364472,Fantastic people. We were in desperate need of a car, and without much in the way of funds. Tugrul, Mike, Phil, and all the guys in finance worked miracles for us. They put us into a great car at an amazing price, with payment terms we could afford. Things are tight for us right now, but against all odds they made it work. I'm completely impressed, and I will buy my next several cars from AutoFair, no question.]
