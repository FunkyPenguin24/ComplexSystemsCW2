[105070145668354652696,100682479186436547266,Just signed my second lease at Stonegate and couldn't be happier. Yes the gate can occasionally go a few days without working but I have yet to live in an apartment where the gate wasn't always broken. The staff in the front office is always extremely nice and will help you out with any problem immediately. The two time I needed maintenance to come out so far they showed up very quickly and fixed it without any problems. The pool area is very nice and the clubhouse has a nice pool table and shuffleboard table along with a separate room with big lounge chairs and big screen tv to watch sports on. Just got new equipment in the fitness center so it is very high end. They have a lot of different floor plans and some of the best prices in Austin. Also a great area with Southpark Meadows right across the highway with almost any store you could need. Would recommend anyone to Stonegate if they are looking to rent in South Austin.]
