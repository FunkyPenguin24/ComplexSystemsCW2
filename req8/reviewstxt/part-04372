[100853147761712514512,100391242567937635663,The school is very dark and dingy, my kids went there and hated it and I was trying to figure out what the problem was then I did a lunch day with them both and they have roaches and rats running along the campus and roaches crawling freely in the cafeteria. When I complained I was told "We are aware and trying to do everything possible to get the rodent situation under control needless to say my kids didn't eat school lunch after that.And exactly 2 weeks later the same issue was still in full effect nothing happen the decided to tell me that since they are backed up against the woods it's normal. So now my kids are no longer at the school.]
