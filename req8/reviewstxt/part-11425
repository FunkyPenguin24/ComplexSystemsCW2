[101462493895639006835,100770191016558593274,I'm finally excited about working out again! I joined WOW for 2 reasons: the team training classes, and the 24 hour access. I love knowing I can go workout whenever I want - including on Holidays if I so desire. The team training classes are amazing. I have gone through the class with various trainers and they are all amazing. They all push in different, but equally challenging & supportive ways. I can't afford a trainer, but with these classes, I get the benefits of a trainer at a price I can afford!! Oh, and I am a huge fan of the steam room... so wonderful after an intense workout or run. The staff are easy to talk to and always willing to help. I live about 25 minutes away from WOW and still think the drive it totally worth it!!]
