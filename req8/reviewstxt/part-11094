[101781165671896514048,100752899718443101100,My car wouldn't start in an downtown Albany garage. The first place I called wouldn't even come saying they couldn't get into the low-ceilinged garage. Osborne came and the technician walked a portable charger to my car. Turns out it wasn't the battery, but the kind gentleman got my car moving so I could get home on a freezing night. I'm not going to start calling the dispatcher for his sparkling personality, but he got a service guy to me and wasn't rude - what more could I ask for? I am very grateful to the road service guy and Joe's Osborne Street Garage.]
