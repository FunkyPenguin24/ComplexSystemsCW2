[105590824114627654954,100508803454382651355,Think of a cleaner version of Cici's Pizza with less chance of digestive distress and you'll be thinking of Talliano's. The employees are polite, clean, and take requests for the buffet. It's not the best pizza, but it's still pretty decent and there's a lot of it.]
