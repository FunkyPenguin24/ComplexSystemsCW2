[115778575727495242663,100058939965861511047,I would definitely recommend everyone to take their vehicle to Joel Auto Repair & Transmission. I recently took my car in to get an oil change, new radiator, and new thermostat and will be using them again to fix my catalytic converter. They offer the lowest prices and do exceptional and fast work. Everyone is friendly, courteous, and extremely helpful and knowledgeable. They are honest and fair. I normally don't take the time to write reviews on places but considering how difficult is to find a good and honest auto repair shop I had to share. I will definitely be using Joel Auto Repair & Transmission for all of my auto repair needs in the future.]
