[114459747910318634194,100150936171697242918,I see Dr. Andy Wright at ABA. I started seeking chiropractic treatment in my hometown several years ago for whiplash/vertebral sprain following a car accident. When I moved to Toledo, I began a search for a new chiropractor. I visited several different offices, but ABA and Dr. Andy made me feel comfortable, explained to me the different type of chiropractic care I would be receiving (because it was different technique than what I had received previously) and he treated other issues I was having sometimes even before they caused me pain or discomfort. I am now 5 months pregnant and Dr. Andy and Laura, one of the massage therapists who works out of ABA, have kept my pain, discomforts, heartburn and headaches to a minimum so that I rarely have to take Tylenol for relief-keeping my baby safe as possible. Scheduling is great - if I need to fix a problem I am almost always seen in the next 3-4 days! But I typically receive care from them every 5 weeks. I really feel as though the treatment I have received through Dr. Andy & Laura have helped me to gain overall health as well as help me to have a smooth, healthy pregnancy.]
