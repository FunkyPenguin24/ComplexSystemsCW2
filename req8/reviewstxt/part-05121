[106982686354244991172,100429613410633458436,Just picked up a 2013 Volvo XC60 from International Volvo of Orland Park. What a great experience I had working with Adam the Internet Manager. I negotiated the price with him via email prior to visiting the dealership and once I arrived he had set me up with my salesman Bob C to take a test drive as well as go over the features of the XC60 and then Joe the finance manager finished up the paperwork. Thanks again to all three of you. Keep up the great service.]
