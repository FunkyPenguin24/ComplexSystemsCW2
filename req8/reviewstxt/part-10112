[115924776825081314009,100700016037098005332,I have had nothing but Great experiences from Patrick and his crew in the past 5 years. When the warranty ran out on my 2007 Bmw I was worried about finding an honest and reliable company to help me keep it running and in good condition. Thankfully I got a recommendation from another BMW owner about MB Auto. After the first time taking my car here I knew I had made the right decision. If you are looking for an Honest , reliable, trustworthy company, It is MB Automotive. Thank you again to Patrick and his great crew]
