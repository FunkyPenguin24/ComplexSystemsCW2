[111780521832128914584,100808391763465919954,I had dinner here recently with my family. It wasn't my first time here, so I knew what to expect. I ordered the lamb and asked that it be cooked medium rare. While we waited, the wines, the ambiance, the service - they were all wonderful, and made for a great dining experience. When the food came out, I cut into a lamb chop and noticed it was medium. If you're like me (which I assume most of you are if you're looking for a steakhouse) - then you're particular about how things are cooked. The maitre d' immediately noticed my concern, and approached me. I told him that it was medium, and that I had requested medium rare - he looked at the lamb and said, you're right. Immediately it was taken back, and a few minutes later the general manager was over to say they were personally overseeing the lamb and would have it out asap. In less than 10 minutes, they had a new plate of lamb out for me, cooked perfectly. I was very pleased with the care and integrity they had in making my meal right. If it's not right, they will fix it, and quickly - and btw, the rest of my family ordered steaks, and they were all cooked to perfection. Overall, the food is delicious and I would recommend Uncle Jack's to anyone looking for an all around great meal, at a price worth the value.]
