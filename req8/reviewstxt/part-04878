[103633610188928038990,100417300935942265727,I'm usually very skeptical of giving 5 star reviews, but Panda House, OMG, it's amazing. The food is authentic Chinese food, tastes really good, the lady works at the counter is very welcoming and helpful. We ordered two stir fries and one beef noodles; each stir fry includes free soup, (fried) rice and desserts. We only spent 18 bucks and the portion is massive. I definitely recommend it.]
