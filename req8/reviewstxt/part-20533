[105691719044694131166,100087510603576918140,My family and I stayed the night on Saturday, Feb 23rd and everything was great. We intended on checking out the next morning and skiing Burke before heading to Jay Peak for the week however when we woke up our 6yr old was sick and was not getting out of bed. Thankfully the extended our checkout time so that she could stay in bed and rest while I took my other daughter to ski for the day as we had pre-purchased our tickets. This place is great and we will be back!]
