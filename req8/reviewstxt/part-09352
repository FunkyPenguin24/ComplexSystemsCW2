[117438892788407350170,100658114771631419316,I have 2 personal and 8 business vehicles serviced there on a regular basis. Always get prompt, professional service at a fair rate. Never leave feeling gouged or lied to. I have sent both my mother and sister there as well and I normally do not refer family members anywhere. A nice side benefit is the record keeping they do. I can always go back and find out what was done to which vehicle with no issues. This has helped once or twice when a part I had replaced broke and was under warranty. I did not even have to ask Roy's - they simply told me that the part was covered by the manufacturer and took care of all the details!]
