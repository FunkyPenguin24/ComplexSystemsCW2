[114473784614492038607,100238524445627933904,Karatsu Kunchi is one of those traditional celebrations in Japan that brings a smile to anyone who experiences it. This festival dates back hundreds of years, and gives all the people involved the freedom to let loose! Random strangers will invite you inside to dine in their homes and drink their sake. People are happy, drunk, and have a big old 3-day party. The highlight of the event are the hiki-yama, or the neighborhood floats. They are intricate, huge, and old. Not to mention beautiful works of art. If you're in the Northern Kyushu area during this festival I highly recommend seeing it.]
