[118064265729806280311,100142974140925297474,My son has been apart of CCN Destin since he was 6 months old, he is now 5. Do to a move I enrolled him in another center, that lasted no more than 2 months and despite the traveling I re-enrolled him in the Destin CCN where he remains to this day. The center and providers are a wonderful and very family like. Mrs.Theresa, the center's Director is one of a kind and has always had a personal approach to dealings with us parents and Miss Michelle his VPK teacher is a blessing. Her teaching skills are above average and my son is reading at 5!! I would recommend any concerned parent join this family and rest assured that your child will be well loved and taken care of!]
