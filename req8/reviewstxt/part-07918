[106532428212058192925,100583220097066553131,Went at 1:30pm to avoid any lunch 'rush" I had the shwarma combo with Fries. Fifteen minutes later I received a nice basket with the Shwarma and hot fries. The fries however, were also greasy -- they had been put in the oil before the oil had reached its correct temperature. The fries were limp, flacid -- although they tasted as though they would be excellent if cooked properly. The meat in the shwarma was a bit dry. I watched two other customers wait 10 minutes after me for a single gyros combo.]
