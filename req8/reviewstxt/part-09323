[104924120329061165971,100656846732636371097,It's really a great club! the protein shake bar is awesome for after workouts(or before if you're into that sort of thing) all the equipment its generally clean and up to par and most members are friendly, encouraging, helpful and full of conversation! The pools are neat but if you're not a parent or elderly, you might want to go at an early or really late hour, for they have aerobics and obnoxious kids(swimming lessons). The outside hot tub is great anytime and you can usually get it to yourself for a few minutes, which is nice! All in all, this is an excellent gym and i recommend it to anyone! Also, the staff is great! They will contact you personally if you express any concern, i'm honestly just amazed. if you're looking for a gym in idaho falls, Go to this one. its not just a gym, its a club and its worth it.]
