[111682011998372678121,100801499324699966020,Jenny H is Great!! The rest is terrible!! After that car had arrived late (but that was not a guarantee apparently just an "estimated" delivery time) I drove away in my "new" car after being told and given a "guarantee" that everything was looked over. I was even given a check list specifically stating this specific stuff had been looked over thoroughly. When I got home the next day I realized the turn signals where out. There where no floor matts, There was a slurpy that had been spilt under the seat (cup was still there) the trimming in the door had been partially removed and clips to keep on the body panel where broken. When I contacted them about it I was told they could get me aftermarket parts for the repairs and I could take the day off of work to drive back down there (about 4 hours round trip) The cost I would insure to do that is much grater that just having the dealer do it locally. This is the 1st time I have written a review like this. Again as a sales consultant Jenny is greatâ€¦But I strongly advise you stay away from the rest of them. A dealer will take much better care of you.]
