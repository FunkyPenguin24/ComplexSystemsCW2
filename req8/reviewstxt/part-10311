[104932782927481185061,100710948439917187013,Driver beware! On Saturday, January 5th I drove my car through the drive-thru here - and a big piece of warped plywood got wedged under my car. The plywood damaged the undercarriage of my car and the repairs are going to cost $370. If you happened to be at this McDonald's on that day around 10:30am and saw anything, PLEASE get into contact with me. Even if you had a similar issue with the plywood board at that location, or witnessed other cars have a problem. The manager (Chris) who came out to help me remove the plywood says he's doesn't remember anything happening, and the insurance company says I made the whole thing up. Of course there's no video! This location is owned by James Dotson, who hasn't returned ANY of my calls. I definitely *do not* recommend anyone take their chances on this place. Dishonest management, disconnected ownership - really a horrible example for a national brand like McDonald's.]
