[104366006733554295635,100892568822504467960,Great food, just love their cubano, the food is just great and we love to go there. In the winter it can be a little chilly though, but that's because the building is old. I've never seen any screaming kids there though and I personally loved the quiet atmosphere. I liked their Chicken cordon bleu balls, they were tasty and I loved the horseradish sauce which had a kick to it. I would recommend this place to anyone!]
