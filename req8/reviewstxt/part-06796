[100956787466416317579,100522017368634611240,If you have not been in Gold's Gym Tampa in a while then you need to come back and check this place out. The owner of Gold's Gym Tampa totally renovated this gym last year. They have added all new machines, free weights, spin bikes. They now offer cross fit cage classes as well as Les Mills Group Exercise classes. They remodeled all of the locker rooms, they even have a sauna in the locker room. They put in all new flooring throughout the gym and painted the entire facility. I love working out here during the week when I train with Edgar, who is a Fantastic personal trainer. However Saturday mornings are my favorite workout day. I like to start with Boot Camp training 1st thing in the morning to get my blood pumping, then I like to do Jessica's Yoga Class, then Shari's Les Mills Body Combat class and end the day with an Awesome Massage with Sierra. (YES they have massage here 7 days a week too!) GOLD'S GYM TAMPA ROCKS!!!!!]
