[113469876234947398271,100028164745672677388,Fantastic - Outstanding! Recently, I had to be in New England for several weeks leaving my family in Galveston. As luck would have it, while I was gone, my wife’s car broke down and had to be repaired. It was a great relief knowing that Miguel Arabia (Dr. Detail) would take care of the car at great speed and very reasonably. Hats Off to a qualified, honest mechanic and his shop. I can recommend Dr. Detail without reservation to everyone needing a car detail or for automotive repairs. Marshall Monroe, Chef, Stacey’s Creative Cuisine.]
