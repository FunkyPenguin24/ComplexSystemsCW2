[114712561479287489312,100415922562037209819,Every time we go, I feel me and my son receive the doctor's full attention. They are proactive when it comes to my son an d I feel comfortable with every doctor there. They never make me feel stupid when I ask questions. Both the nurses and the doctors try to help me as much as possible. They have my son on an expensive formula and they give me samples whenever they can to help us out. I love this office and will be sad if we have to move.]
