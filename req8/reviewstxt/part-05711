[103572362513109885292,100461834671643990859,Let me start by stating the fact that Grubbs will take the test drive to you. I called in during my lunch break and was too busy to go in for a test drive to the dealership. Tim Roberts informed me that he could bring the car to my workplace to test drive. I cannot emphasize how important this was to me, especially with a full schedule. Once I decided to purchase the car, I was given all the information I asked for and more. Since this was my first car buying experience, I was guided by Tim and others in the Grubbs Infiniti team (Pete Hankins and Nick Amandelaro) through the process. I was given a great deal on the car and got numerous options on warranties and financing options. The people at Grubbs Infiniti do an outstanding job of making you feel like family and are some of the nicest and most customer service oriented people I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I definitely recommend the dealership if you're thinking about leasing/buying a new or used Infiniti.]
