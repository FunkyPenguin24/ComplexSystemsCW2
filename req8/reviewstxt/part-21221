[108847061388604335666,100124094719908623591,My fiance has always been interested in Martial Arts and when he mentioned possibly wanting to take classes here, I immediately responded with, "I'd love to take the classes with you!" Then I thought about what I had just committed to and became EXTREMELY nervous. I stressed about starting for the entire week (I mean REALLY stressed) and then the day finally came for our first class. Upon arriving, we were greeted warmly by EVERYONE and not one person made us feel unwelcome. The class went so well and by the end, all of my nerves had disappeared and I was very very excited about coming to the next class. Any person here that you are communicating with, whether it is an instructor or a new friend, is extremely helpful and they all want you to succeed without feeling any pressure or judgement. What better atmosphere could you ask for? I have only been training here for 4.5 weeks, however this program has given me a new outlook on a lot of things and most importantly, it's so much fun! My fiance and I are finding ourselves much more interested in practicing techniques at home rather than wedding planning. Not complaining though :) I would and DO recommend training here to my friends and everyone else! I guess it's also important to point out that what are you are learning during classes is very useful and can be applied to our every day. Whether it's life lessons, a physical self-defense technique, or learning how to fall without injuring yourself, everything here is taught in a way that can be understood with modern-day scenarios.]
