[102596766713736674725,100771204141675715558,I have found Executive Dental Arts on Google when we moved to this area. I feel that it was a lucky find. Dr. Spivak is a wonderful dentist. Extremely knowledgeable and attentive. Explains every details about any procedure. My wife and I already use his office and our son will be going there when he turns 2. His assistant Julie is great and always with a smile ready to help. His office is new, clean and spacious. His equipment is new and well maintained. It is a pleasure to provide a personal recommendation to Dr. Spivak and Executive Dental Arts.]
