[115226271075241252720,101031862143475066106,i would like to let anyone who has not had the opportunity to visit Bert Fish Medical Center, that you have missed what real medical attention is all about. You. The real person, not what you have or don't have. Just you with a medical problem. Of course you will have to be responsible for your needs, but that is not there first concern. Again it is you they are concerned with. I went there this week with a life threatening dilemma. Scared to death that I would be turned away, but too sick to do anything else. I had no choice but to take a chance with this hospital. To my delight they opened their arms and their hearts and gave me first class treatment and service. From administration to aids, everyone was top notch. My surgeon was world class, down to coming in early to secure that my procedure was a success. I am one of so many that is not employed as of now, but I do have work coming this winter and will be able to pay may bill in full, I know that matters like we all do, but what got me is that Bert Fish cared about me first. Thank you, Thank you, Thank you.]
