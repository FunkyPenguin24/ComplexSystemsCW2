[110924040385217423266,100939294742236189229,I was shopping around with my parents for a car. We stopped by Nissan of Manhattan, the sales person James Tan was very knowledgeable with the product and tentative to our needs. He was not pushy nor in a hurry to make a quick sale. He patiently answered a long list of repetitive questions in Mandarin, Cantonese and in English to cater to each of us. His excellent customer service and attention to detail made it an excellent experience. I would not hesitate to recommend my friends and family to him.]
