[100717301281374319630,100836583983297945811,The teenagers who work there an incredibly unprofessional. I stepped on a wasp there last summer (ow!) an had to get first aid. First they asked me I I was allergic to wasps, I said no, and the girl responded with "good because were out of epi-pens." They took my vitals while talking about high school gossip and then had to ask three time for some ice to put on the swelling. (i did a first aid/cpr class and i know what to do for a single un allergic bee-sting) Then I asked if someone could get my bag bc it had my glasses in it because I was getting a headache from not wearing them. Nobody went for it, thank god my friend came to check up on me and got me my bag and glasses. I took an Advil I had in my purse then went home to get the stinger out myself. I worry about what would have happened if I had a serious medical issue]
