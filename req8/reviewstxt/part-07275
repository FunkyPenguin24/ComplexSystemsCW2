[106810153623068544113,100547483583823297265,A glass pane from our hutch broke just before Christmas. Packerland had already closed, but one man was still in the office. He saw me and quickly came to unlock the door. Then he took the broken parts, measured them and cut me a new piece right there. He didn't take my name for someone else to handle when the shop was open again. That is great service.]
