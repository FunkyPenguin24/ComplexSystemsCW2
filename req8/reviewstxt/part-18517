[116638148040140734923,101156903920123491799,I was so excited to find Gluten Free Pizza, I had a coupon to buy one take out gluten free pizza and get one to bake later. I was dissapointed when I was handed my second pizza shrink wrapped and frozen. Reminded me of grocery store frozen pizza. The pizza was okay, not delicious but to be expected with GF.]
