[114726274553479628162,100523579034832139406,I entered this establishment to inquire about getting my newly adopted dog spayed. The Woman I dealt with was smug and unhelpful. When I was asking about appointments, she began to shake her head before she even started looking. It turned out there were appointments available, so why the head shaking? This came off as very negative. I inquired about pricing and when she told me, she totally had an air of, "You can't afford this." I told her that I had heard that they participate in the c-snip program and offer affordable spaying and neutering. She donned her smug smile again and shook her head while she took great pleasure in telling me, "no." If this Woman has pets, I feel sorry for them.]
