[110760563459810520016,100917364967113848156,I've found my experience at Mr. Mike's to be the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. When I got there for a 6:30pm reservation, it wasn't busy but it still took 10 minutes for someone to finally come and seat us. The woman who seated us was pretty rude and unapologetic of the wait. Our waitress didn't take long to hand us menus and take our drink order. Our drinks were brought pretty quickly (best part of the experience). I had ordered a Long-Island iced tea which was very watered down. Probably the worst Long-Island iced tea I've had. When she brought our drinks, our waitress didn't ask us if we were ready to order, instead she turned to the table beside us, and asked the couple who got there 15 minutes after us if they were ready to order. Once she brought the couple their food, she finally took our order. We ordered tiger shrimp stuffed mushrooms, which is claimed to be a favourite on the menu but is actually disgusting. We also ordered two New York striploin steaks medium rare. We were brought the wrong food twice and when our food finally came, she waitress forgot our appetizer. It was finally brought to us (after we had to ask again) once we were almost done our meal. My steak was basically still breathing and for the price you pay, you're not getting much. Our entree was about $25 but should've been lower priced. It came with a few string beans and carrots and two onion rings and a steak. The waitress was unapologetic about the lateness of our appetizer. I was pretty upset that a couple who got there 15 minutes after us had their order taken and was served before us. I wouldn't recommend this place at all, save your money. It's not worth it.]
