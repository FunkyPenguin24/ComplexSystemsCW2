[106170869012996412572,101150661555952607626,I have been using DR.Slatten for over 30 years.Two gals that work with me use him and one just took her daughter to see him, I took my mother to see him and she lives in Lawton. Just got back from his office. WOW. He now is one of two Optometrists in the state with Scription. I was so impressed with the exam. His staff is great. They always have taken care of me. I have vision in only one eye so this is who I trust.I can't wait to get my new glasses.]
