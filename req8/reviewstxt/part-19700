When I moved into my apartment, there was hair in the shower, old charcoal and cleaning supplies from the previous owner in the laundry room, one or two things in the fridge, and crumbs all over - never been cleaned. I got my key, then had to process into Fort Lee. By the time I returned and got to my apartment to move in, they were gone for the day, so I couldn't do anything about the issue. I cleaned it myself because it was so filthy and reported it the next day. They said there was nothing they could do because I had no way to prove it and I shouldn't have cleaned it up myself. Why would I make something like that up and report it to them!? I wasn't even asking them for anything, I said, "I just want to bring to your attention that my apartment was like this and you may want to keep an eye out that nobody else moves into a place like that." They had a nasty attitude to respond and got very defensive saying I couldn't prove it. Whatever. I have finally moved out and refuse to move into another Independence Place due to my experience at the Fort Lee one. I don't even want to visit someone that lives at one. I hate IP. They have owed me a few hundred dollars for overpaying my rent before moving out at the end of May 2013. It is now November 2013 and they still have not sent me the check, despite me calling at least once a week. Each time I call, they listen to my story as if they hadn't heard it before and say, "Oh, I think I remember you... I'm so sorry, what's a good address to mail it to you and a phone number to reach you at?" They have never contacted me and I still do not have the check. I am taking them to court if I do not get the check soon. They stole my money.]
