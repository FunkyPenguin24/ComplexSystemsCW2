[103839463450930764470,100782045612376061251,After waiting 5 weeks for my shade sail to arrive, they arrived but had been poorly measured and could not be fitted. That afternoon I received the following email: "For us to redo the shades will cost us more on this job than if we just call it quits at this point. Therefor we are not going to proceed any further and just accept our loss at this stage". While I accept mistakes happen, a business that treats customers like this does not deserve your business and I urge you to find a more reputable business to deal with.]
