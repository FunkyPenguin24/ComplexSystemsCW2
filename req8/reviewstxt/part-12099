[101865499454320186442,100806571625951613948,Food: The only food items they had were fried (except hot dogs and hamburgers), No guacamole, Nothing was clear what kind of meat it was, and they were very stingy with the "Free" alcohol which they repeatedly emphasized that tips were not included. Overall the food tasted terrible except for the chips and salsa) Beach: Dirty, could not sleep on it because people would come by literally more than once a minute trying to sell you stuff. The excursions they suggested were not good at all and the "Jungle Tour" simply shuttled you from one sparse set of shops to another and tried to get you to buy things there. The final restaurant we went to was the only place you could get food as it was in fact in the jungle and it cost about 15 dollars for a piece of chicken and a couple of leaves of lettuce. I do not recommend this tour option. The staff, however, were very friendly and helpful when you asked anything of them. Almost everyone spoke both English and Spanish (So did everyone in Puerto Vallarta, it seemed)]
