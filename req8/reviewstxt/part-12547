[101087045793472098831,100830928336767667342,I have been going to Dr. Andresen at Andresen Active Healthcare for one year and I am very happy at this practice. They are very flexible and accommodating in terms of scheduling - I am able to make same-day appointments. The office is well-equipped, welcoming and clean. The staff is always very friendly. Dr. Andresen himself is the ultimate professional and very in-tune with the needs of his patients. It's a no-pressure practice - Dr. Andresen doesn't push package "deals" or treatments you don't need, like other chiropractors sometimes do. Dr. Andresen treated me when I was pregnant (from about 22-37 weeks) and has also treated my infant daughter, so I really trust him. The optional hour-long massages are heavenly and a great value.]
