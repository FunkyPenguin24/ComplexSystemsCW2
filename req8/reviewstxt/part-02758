[100143132140901389585,100301253515100054652,Airport is well maintained, it is beautiful, traditional Kerla architecture. What I didn't like is quality of food available, bought Pizza for Rs 120, and it was pathetic 4" home made non-veg pizza with hardened chicken like rubber, and tomato sauce topping with only onion and tomato. This is kerla is tourist destination, was expecting good food options. Special for tourist who will be travelling to different locations from here]
