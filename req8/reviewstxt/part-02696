No one here acts like they really want to be there or want the job, which makes customers feel like they should get lost and stop adding to the irritation. Part of this effect is probably from being located in snooty-town, Shorewood, but this location is 100% of the reason I started a private account with UPS, who apologized and said they're not responsible for franchise locations like this one. My advice to the employees is: try treating the customers like people that you actually enjoy meeting, not like a nuisance.]
