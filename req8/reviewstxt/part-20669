[110460019584211958011,100094633669646209394,My husband and i have been eating regularly at the Post Deng Cafe since it was the Post Mao Cafe a little further up the street. It's a truly wonderful place, and the food is glorious. In particular, the shredded fillet steak, crossback lamb ribs, and triple-cooked pork hock have me writhing in my seat with pleasure every time we order one of them for dinner. (Can't have more than one of the three on the table without a large group, though, it's a LOT of food.) If you just look at the surface, they don't look very professional, but they clearly care about what they're doing, and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable, much more towards friendly than formal. It's truly the only place i've ever been able to truly relax while eating out. They've taken excellent care of us every time we've been there, and we'll be regulars there as long as they exist, hopefully for many delicious years to come.]
