[106384774524525724559,101052531221873970405,I purchased my new 2014 Mini Cooper Countryman JCW from Debbie Ivie. It was a wonderful experience. There was no pressure and she was very communicative during the entire process. Living 2 hours from the dealership I wanted to have as mush done as possible before making the trip. She made it possible for me to show up and see the car sign the documents and drive off. I would recommend this dealership and Debbie Ivie to any one.]
