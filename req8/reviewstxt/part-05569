[109350109057738045539,100454418537238486929,Who are we kidding? This is a more expensive Planet Play without the video games. Same salad bar, same pasta bar, same basic pizza. The pasta bar has 6-7 sauces instead of Planet Play's 2, the pizza is marginally better, the salad bar is exactly the same. Pizza Pie Cafe has better tasting and more exotic pizzas, but doesn't have Planet Play's baked potato bar, nor their ice cream machine or chocolate chip cookies. Also drinks are not included; add the $1.79 cost for a drink to your basic $8.50 pizza buffet charge, and it costs more than Planet Play's basic $8.99 cost including drinks. I didn't have their pizza desserts, but was told they taste great, especially the apple cobbler thingey. I'd recommend this place to: People with a lot of hungry kids. Everyone fills up for about two bucks less than Chuckarama.(No drinks). I'd also recommend this place if you want to limit your spending because if you take them to Planet Play, the kids will whine six ways to Sunday until you spring for a few video game plays. Like all good Utah buffets, the soda dispenser includes Diet Dr Pepper. Ahhhhhhhh.]
