[110913942027904713716,100330554158719823109,I hired them to do a carpet cleaning after I found out they were cleaning the carpets at my office, which always look impeccable no matter how many customers have walked on them that day. The cleaner arrived almost on time, which a tiny delay of about 10 minutes, but I didn't mind. What I hadn't foreseen was that the service we use at the office is in fact a dry carpet cleaning and the one I ordered was just an ordinary one so I ended up with completely soaked carpets. I had to wait almost a day for them to dry out and couldn't set foot in my living room the whole day.]
