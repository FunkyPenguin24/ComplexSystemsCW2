[100533398425710958755,100038724745051946515,I got my wisdom teeth removed last week which was pending from 6 years. Teeth was in inclined position coz of which doctor need to cut open and do the extraction. Whole procedure was very smooth and didn't had any pain during and after extraction. Post extraction medication/treatment was good. I would suggest Venu's Dental for any kind of dental treatments.]
