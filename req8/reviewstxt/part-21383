[103978987766730659730,100134034362924537240,Ever since this place opened, my wife and I have been hardcore prophets bringing many out of town friends and family in there. "Great rolls, chicken fried chicken, vegetables, and waffles" etc.... They had an excellent selection of vegetables and you were able to choose the 3, out of 10 or so, of them. Our favorites included whole glazed carrots, green beans, and some great mac & cheese. However, they now just give you some pretty mediocre mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. They changed their menu on 12-12-08, took away the great salad and bread appetizers and made some other big changes that really knocked this place down from an excellent five star home cooking place down to a pretty mediocre establishment. The venerable "chicken friend chicken and waffles" is no longer a menu item, although they did allow me to still order that. There are now many better places in the area, but maybe they will get some sense and go back to the old way of doing things.]
