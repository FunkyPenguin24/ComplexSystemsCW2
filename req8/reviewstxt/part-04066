[105850539776401394642,100373071250883500886,I had my first visit to this dental office last week a follow up a few days ago and today another check up ( upon my request). I absolutely LOVE the dentist and the staff here. They are such a joy to be around and extremely upbeat and happy. They have taken very good care of me and I recommend going here rather than their office on the east side. I originally made an appointment there, but the receptionist and staff were extremely rude and unhelpful and I am happy to have switched offices for my appointments. They also have very good pricing for those whom are uninsured, the best I found in the area!! <3 <3 <3]
