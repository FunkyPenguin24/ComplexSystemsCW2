[114335749897941196411,100288512951806726366,I absolutely love going to Dr. Wing for my orthodontic treatment, I love my braces, they have never given me a problem and I see changes in my smile every single time I go to get an adjustment. I am very happy to have chosen Dr. Wing as my orthodontist. I am fascinated by the way my teeth are moving and shifting. The staff is always very friendly and they remember who you are so you always feel welcome. Dr Wing is an outstanding doctor who I definitely recommend when people go to into the dental office I work at. Thanks so much! I'm super EXCITED for May when i get my braces off!]
