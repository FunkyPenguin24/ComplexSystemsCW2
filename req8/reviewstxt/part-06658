[110424809655993023085,100514393260371813323,If I had read the reviews below before eating here, I never would have tried it. I'm glad I did! They have the best, most affordable lunch specials. My favorite thing to order is the terriyaki shrimp with fried rice, it has to be the best I've ever had, cooked to a perfect slightly-crunchiness with great sauce. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is the lady that's a waitress there is always a little moody, so the service leaves something to be desired...and having been a waitress before myself, I am usually not that picky or negative about that sort of thing. So, if you can prepare yourself with the possibility of dealing with a little attitude & go just for the food, you'll enjoy eating here. :)]
