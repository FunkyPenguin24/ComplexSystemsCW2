[114015448836334160397,100028837526047805194,A friend referred me to Becca, and I cannot thank her enough! In just a year, I've trusted Becca to do pretty much everything to my hair - cut, highlight, all over color, keratin treatment, bangs (!) - and I've never been happier about the way it looks. She's incredibly talented and has the sweetest personality. I always look forward to going in to see her, which is important when you have super thick hair like mine that takes hours to highlight, cut, and style! I wholeheartedly recommend Becca and Philip Michael Salon!]
