[105966169161758550869,100632223860112358612,I took my family of 7 to Copper Mountain Ski Resort during the week of Thanksgiving. 6 out of 7 had never been skiing before. I rented the ski's online at Christy Sports from the Copper Mountain website. Very simple to do and i saved 20% by doing it online. Upon arrival all the paperwork was done and the process of getting ski's and snowboards was simple. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I would recommend this location to anyone needing equipment rental. Thank you for a pleasant experience.]
