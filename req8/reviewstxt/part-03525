[103836149954504287475,100342038690629812745,I have never in my life had such a horrific experience at Wal Mart. I grew up going to Wal mart, love Wal mart and always get SUPER excited about my Wal mart trips. They always have the products and materials I need at very fair prices. Today, however, a walmart employee verbally assaulted me. I was waiting to check out in the 15 items or less line and a walmart employee was trying to get by with her cart. She just stood in front of me and glared and sighed acting as though I was inconviencing her. I quickly and politely asked her if I needed to move and she continued with her snarled look and slightly shook her head yes. I replied, "ma'am all you had to do was say excuse me" in which case she pushed me and my cart aside and walked away with her empty cart. Just 20 seconds later she walked back up to me and started screaming at me in front of everyone saying that she did say excuse me and cursing at me. I was absolutely humiliated. I kept repeating "ma'am I hope you have a great day, ma'am I hope your day gets better" and she just kept screaming. Finally she walked away from me, walked back to her cash register (about 4 down from me) and kept screaming at me from that far away. Again- absolutely humiliating. I quickly checked out and then requested to speak with the manager. When the manager approached, before I could even finish my story he interrupted me and said ma'am first of all I'm so sorry- let me take care of this and walked away in the opposite direction- never to be heard from again. This place is a joke in terms of customer service and I know for a FACT Wal Mart has higher standards than this. As mentioned previously, I have been a faithful Wal Mart customer nearly my entire life and never have I seen such terrible customer service. I hope their business etiquette greatly improves but I will NOT be in support of this particular Wal Mart establishment ever again.]
