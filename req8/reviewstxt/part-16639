[114273275244981455128,101055525393575308796,The staff is kind here, I don't sleep with pajamas and never encountered bed bugs. Its quiet so I was able to get two good nights of sleep. Over all it was very clean but they could do a better job of cleaning the tub out. The shower head has good pressure and allows for easy changes to the settings. For some reason the window in my room opened all the way and had no screen. All in all it is a good place to stay when in town, with easy access to and from the interstate and close to restaurants. Has a rather small pool but it was fenced in and secured as well as very clean. Although I did not use the pool, I would've had no problem if I felt the need. And for the $58/night that I paid in mid June, it was perfect!]
