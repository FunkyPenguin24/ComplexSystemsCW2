[111565079901625920606,100065279672311366329,I went there to buy music book and flute cleaning rod. One young male was helped me to find it and gave me the price. The price was on the tag also. I took both to the counter and an young lady rang the items. Rod rang as $6.29 but the tag said $5.99. I mentioned that price difference and asked why. The lady checked the inventory and told me that $6.29 is the right price and the price just went up, do you still want it? I think that is cheating (displaying one price and charging another). I went ahead and bought it but that is my last trip to that store. I have a photo with tag and receipt. I think the MO state recently sued Walgreens for similar issue.]
