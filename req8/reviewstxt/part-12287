[111999413140719689741,100816490398723221467,This hotel is awful!! And a poor representation of the marriott Brand, This makes me dislike all Marriott hotels. We had several rooms there,spending over $2k atleast, and their service is disgusting. Not to mention I was in detroit for an event, and the staff reuined all my work clothes. I was left with one outfit for the rest of my stay because they reuined them, stained them, and shrank all of my clothes. Working with claims isnt any better, they are trying to give me little to nothing as reimbursement for my clothes. Travelers beware, do not stay here, its not worth it!!!!]
