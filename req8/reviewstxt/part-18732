[101755599545358611883,101169411951173437286,We start to twitch if we go more than a week without Chipotle. You can switch up your order however you like, every time you go, and everything is fresh and tasty. I feel a little silly praising a chain restaurant but I really feel like Chipotle is worth it. My wife and I have even decided that the next time we move around town, there has to be one nearby. We like it *that* much. Decor never changes, but is nifty enough to stare at (or look out the windows at the world). Service is always super fast. From the time you enter the front door to the time you sit down with your grub, it won't be more than 8 minutes tops, and frequently less.]
