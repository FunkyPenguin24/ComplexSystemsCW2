[112844659209273382161,100682132791135411310,The staff was wonderful. The area was open and clean, the facilities were nice, not too dirty but not too clean, but you're camping so what do you expect? We just got back and are already planning our next stay. We recommend this site to anyone looking to go float the river or get outdoors.]
