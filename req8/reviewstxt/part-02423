[107471739674417564537,100283910828166669001,I have been a regular visitor to Budapest over the past year, and tried a few places, but this is by far the best. Not only is it ideally located in the interesting part of Budapest, but it is also quiet. There is plenty to enjoy in the thoughful provision of things to make a stay easy, enjoyable and interesting. John also helped me out when I needed it.]
