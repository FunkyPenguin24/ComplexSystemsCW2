[103561005260102812983,100206090528379264205,Rick, his wife and his team have always been great to my wife and I. We have two vehicles and take both of them there exclusively. Their oil changes are cheap and have never had to return to have work redone. Their mechanic fixed some potentially major issues with my truck and it's running great. They also donate all used and old oil to Oregon Heat, a local non profit that helps heat homes in the winter for families in need. Take your car here. You won't regret it. -B]
