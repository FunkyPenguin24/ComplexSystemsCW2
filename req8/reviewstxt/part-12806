[106658803281450357249,100845777331356242782,While visiting Port St. Lucie, Florida we were looking for a place to get some pizza. We asked someone for a recommendation and she suggested Frank and Al's. We were very happy we tried them. They have great NY style pizza with an exceptional crust and the pizza was nice and hot when it came to our table.]
