[106162929880485640962,101048525095459242411,This place has live entertainment, that's a plus, its basically a fight to get a drink, and one time i was told i was drunk, hadn't had a beer yet cuz they were busy. The bartender, who's name starts with a G, was a jerk to me, called me sloppy drunk and then had me removed from the bar. I was mad because he kept my 50 dollar bill. Worst $50 beer ever (plus cover) i refuse to go back. Also just urinate anywhere, smells like everyone else does. Your bathroom is just disgusting! On a good note the waitresses i had b4 were just great!]
