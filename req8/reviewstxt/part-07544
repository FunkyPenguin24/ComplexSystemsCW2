[108853499276338964363,100563176479138802762,I confess to my guilty indulgence going to 4Rivers BBQ for not only BBQ but great mouthwatering slices of cakes. The food is awesome, the staff is extremely friendly and patient and I absolutely love going to any of their locations. For the folks who are impatient New Yorkers like me who hate to wait in lines, simply order in advance and pick up at the takeout window! That's my little secret for you! I must also add that the Founder of 4Rivers, John Rivers, is an awesome Entrepreneur and Businessman. I had a chance to hear him speak at a business event and he is definitely worth investigating with regards to his practical business wisdom and savvy about financing and management Four Rivers is one of the best kept secrets in Orlando for not just great food but also great BBQ!]
