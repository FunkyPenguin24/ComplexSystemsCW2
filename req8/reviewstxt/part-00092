[100690560658260983877,100163536796307105903,this place is a nitemare, first off.... i delivered my first son there in 2002 and it was awful. the nurse was yelling at me and they made me walk around in more pain then i could ever have imagined. every hr they had 15 nursing students come in and check my dialation, wich is painfull enough with 1 person, let alone 15 STUDENTS! they ignored my repeated requests to not allow the students in with me. my son was born sickly and now suffers from mental impairment due to oxygen deprivation thanx to the ob dr's waiting too long to deliver him with no fluid in the sac. he nearly died. my next awful story is that of my sister inlaw who repeatedly brought her daughter into the er telling them that she was sick. they told her it was a common cold. this occured several times befor the child lost her sight speach and mobility. they then told her it was SPINAL MENENGITIS! the child survived a few months as a vegetable and has since died. way to go abington]
