[106902090750405104341,100668700046260867022,My experience at the Oak Tree has been the the experience of a life time. Reasons behind my statement is for the simple fact of the staff that gives their all. I didn't think that there were people out in the world that actually care about your well-being. (A Man of Your Word) is posted all over the properties and they are being living examples of what that really means. This was the best decision I made when I chose to come to the Oak Tree Recovery House. It's most definitely the best Sober Living transitional home I'd ever been in. I recommend that if you want the best service from individuals who will love you into early recovery, I would advise you to give the Oak Tree a shot. You will not regret it for sure.]
