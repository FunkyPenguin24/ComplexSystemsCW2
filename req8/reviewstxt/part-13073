[102774227575674323461,100861101128863814988,I was there on a busy long weekend. There was a queue out the door, but there's a friendly maitre'd who got everyone seated in pretty reasonable time. Kids are well catered for with colouring-in supplies, a playground out the back door, and a kids menu. There was also a particularly skilled face painter on hand that day. Food was excellent (decent portions, nicely presented and cooked well), as was the coffee (espresso & piccolo). The staff are great are talking you through the coffee taste profiles and choosing the best beans to take home. The table service was a little slow, but not bad considering it was rammed for Sunday lunch. The crowd was a great balance of hairy hipster, lycra-clad cyclists, young (hip) families and local council housing residents. Recommended.]
