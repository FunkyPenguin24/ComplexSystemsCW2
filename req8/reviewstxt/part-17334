[108912864479448289156,101093494210014532529,This was the first (and so far, only) restaurant I've visited in Northern Liberties. I was treated to this restaurant by a friends family and let me just say that after visiting El Camino Real, many of the other restaurants in the area have a lot to live up to. We had to stand awkwardly in the entrance way to wait for a table to open up, but we were seated within five minutes of arriving and our orders were taken immediately afterwards. The servers were very courteous and polite and had no problem taking multiple orders in a very short span of time. The quality of the food was far better than I had ever expected. One order of the homemade nachos and guacamole were more than needed for the five of us seated at the table and they were very, very tasty (if not a little bit on the spicy side). By the recommendation of my friend, I ordered a chicken quesadilla and it was by far the most delicious thing I think I've ever eaten at a Tex-Mex restaurant. The chicken inside was prepared very well and the ranchero sauce on top added a nice creaminess and paired well with the cheese inside. The only problem would have to be how crowded and loud it was -- but for a Saturday night at such a seemingly popular restaurant, I didn't expect any different. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a nice night out with a young, friendly atmosphere and great food.]
