[114785785146987963517,101055809718077003715,So I'll try to recap my experience as objectively as possible: Last December my wife and I needed to board our recently adopted Staffordshire Bull Terrier. She was a rescue dog that was totally submissive and never had... and never HAS... shown any aggressive behavior with us or any of our friends' pets. We emailed the W.R. and were told by their staff that they do not allow this particular breed to play in their 'play rooms.' Here is the email exchange prior to the date of boarding. Woof Room: "Unfortunately we can't have full bred Staffordshire Bull Terriers in open play daycare. If your dog is mixed with another breed we will be more than happy to do an evaluation. Also, your dog can still stay in the hotel but she would receive personal walks throughout the day instead of daycare. Please let us know if this works for you and we can go ahead and get her scheduled." My response: "We have an evaluation scheduled, where we can talk more, but we don't know if she is mixed or not as she was adopted. If you feel more comfortable keeping her away from other dogs, we trust your instincts. She may prefer one-on-one time to play daycare." We boarded her, shook hands and left the state to visit family for the holidays. I received a phone call the next day informing me that our dog attacked and killed another dog (a papillon) while in the 'play area.' We were responsible for paying the vet bills, cremation, and the full cost of replacing the family dog. The Woof Room spoke on the other owners' behalf and insisted that were responsible for 100% of any resulting costs. They utterly washed their hands of any responsibility... unless you count the money they paid to the other family... and seemed hostile anytime I questioned their liability. After a few scary, tense, and sad weeks we were left with nearly $2000 in expenses and a city labeled DANGEROUS DOG. We are currently enrolled in private sessions to help with our dog's behavior (hoping to knock down the label to our dog). Here is my subjective opinion: 1. It was unfair for the W.R. to loosely represent the other owners in dealing with us... and extremely uncomfortable when dealing with the hostile co-owner 2. We were told that our dog was put in a time out the night before for acting aggressive towards this poor little dog... and she was put back into the same room with her the next morning... a sign on poor communication/diligence with the employees. Totally irresponsible!!!! 3. During the entire incident I did not feel like I was treated as a customer... but rather as a malicious criminal. _________________________ I STRONGLY urge you to consider boarding your pet somewhere else. I cannot even imagine what the other family must have gone through... and hopefully the Woof Room's inexperienced staff never allows this tragedy to happen again!]
