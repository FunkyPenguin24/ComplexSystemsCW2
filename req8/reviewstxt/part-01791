[112763798692395768065,100252060475646979845,This place doesn't want your business. They wouldn't mount my tires because I didn't buy them there. They gave me some BS, that they weren't able to replace the tire if it got damaged during install, a policy put in place due to idiots putting 22s on a civic. I told them it was a factory tire and size replacement, didn't matter. I told them I would sign a waiver, didn't matter. That's cool, I'll give my business to some one who wants my money.]
