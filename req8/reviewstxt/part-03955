[102928879155079233088,100367018944315345527,After seeing Crystal Lee's photographs following several of my friends' weddings, I'm convinced she's definitely the one that my bride and I will have taking our photos. She's top notch, works with only the best equipment and when she's had a "second shooter" along for more coverage of an event, that person is just as qualified and professional as Crystal. You'll be impressed with her eye for "the shot" and you'll be impressed with your album on your coffee table for years to come.]
