[114148916398952777802,100248349996799365942,The Olive Garden in Middletown has the WORST customer service I have seen in a long time! I have worked in food service so I know at times you get bad employees, I get that... So I usually don't allow that to sway me from eating there too much. But EVERY TIME out of the 3 times I have ordered carry out we have had a problem with the person taking the order and 2 times now I have been treated like I am a huge inconvenience for them when I get there to pick up the order.. I don't say this often but I will NO LONGER spend a dime in that location!]
