[117307151506039470173,100155274965797728802,We came here for my wife's birthday because we heard they make great cocktails. The cocktails did not disappoint, but the service was mediocre at best. We had to wait nearly 30 min for a table, IN SPITE OF HAVING A RESERVATION, and there was an unusually long wait between bringing our drink and taking a food order, even though we all got appetizers. Clearly they are trying to maximize profits by squeezing reservations close together and overworking the wait staff. All of this wouldn't have bothered me too much except that they automatically added a 20% gratuity to our bill. I reserve 20% for a truly great restaurant experience, which this was not, and bristled a bit at not having a choice in the matter. I understand the need for automatic gratuities for large groups, but there were only 7 of us, so this seemed excessive. Oh yeah, and if you don't like seafood, the menu is a bit limited.]
