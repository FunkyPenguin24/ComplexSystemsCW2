[111743853173327645263,100418823063786380389,Collinâ€™s Nissan is an absolutely fantastic dealership. Every time I visit this dealership, I am treated well and the staff is always very helpful. Paul Rankin has been our sales representative, and he has done a terrific job at meeting my needs. He is very informative, professional, friendly and honest! He always answers my questions with a smile and goes the extra mile. If you are looking to purchase a car, I highly recommend this dealership, and Paul. It has been a fantastic experience, that I hope to continue in the future.]
