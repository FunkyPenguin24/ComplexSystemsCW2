[108358138614683410512,100168631011525491228,I was told that I would get my linens delivered today from 1:30-2:30 and it is now 4:30pm. Not an easy company to work with, period! I was here and even followed thru with a place for them to pick up and deliver without me being present. My company was not able to deliver services as a result. Even though my preferred delivery time slot is 2-4they insist on interrupting while you are trying to conduct your business and services. Not happy with this!]
