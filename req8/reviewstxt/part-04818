[110763028291423707831,100414062904440828590,I was quite impressed with my purchase. I had to do a trade and was able to get completely out of my old car with no negative equity and into a brand new 2012 Mazda 6 i Sport 6 Speed Manual. Took a little bit of time to find the my car, but it worked out great and they worked with me on the financial side as well. A fantastic group of workers. Special thanks to Mike Marotta and Tony and Zach.]
