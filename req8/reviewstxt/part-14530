[116107493117088138248,100942222588025755708,We started coming to Gulf Shores about four years ago, and we always stay on the Fort Morgan road. The first year we were there, we discovered Scoops, and now it's part of our daily routine. We play all day, eat a big dinner out, and then go to Scoops for dessert. Every day we're there! Love it. The ice cream is excellent, but perhaps more importantly, the staff are unfailingly courteous, friendly, and cheerful, even during their busiest times! Only wish it was a little bigger so more people could enjoy it! Huge thumbs up!]
