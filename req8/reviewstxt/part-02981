[105529342655000036081,100313077909348372922,On December 6, 2012 I bought a brand new 2013 Hyundai Elantra GT with the Touch & Go Package. I am extremely happy with my purchase and felt comfortable working with John Sacco to finalize my decision to buy the car. The price was reasonable for a brand new model car, and given there was not a very large inventory being held. I would definitely recommend Burns Hyundai to anyone looking to purchase their next vehicle.]
