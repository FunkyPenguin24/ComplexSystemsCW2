[105489187274545455864,101120847002892122155,Quick and easy. Izzy was very helpful. Really like the vehicle I purchased, and it was a great deal. A warning on trade ins though: the manager gave extreme lowball on trade-in that was over $3000 below blue book value. I shouldn't have accepted it but I did. They then then proceeded to list the car I traded in for nearly double the price that they paid me for it. They didn't even take into account nearly $3000 in recent maintenance and new tires. They are great for customer service and car deals, but don't trust them to trade in your car.]
