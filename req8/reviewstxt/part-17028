[109057144458483194208,101077375902415961288,I was having issues with my Civic not starting a few weeks back during the "cold snap" and had to get it jumped. After I had it jumped I took it to the Brooklyn Center Honda dealership where I purchased the new-used car a few months back and they told me the battery tested good. They also changed the oil and supposedly checked fluids. Fast forward to yesterday when we had another cold snap. I went out to start my car and low and behold...it didn't start. I was able to jump the car and get it to Luther Hopkins Honda (I was referred by a friend) and was helped by Jace Harken and Jim Manning (both super awesome, by the way!). They were able to immediately find the source of the issue (yup, the battery was no good) and even found some fluids that needed to be changed. I was super impressed by the problem-solving and friendly, efficient service there and will definitely be bringing my car back to Hopkins Honda from here on out. Thanks, Jim and Jace!]
