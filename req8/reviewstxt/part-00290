[101491446281138107755,100174664972371871070,I was very frustrated with dealerships and the whole idea of car shopping. Classic Nissan was a breath of fresh air. Ian was great, He took the time to listen and find us what we needed, not try to "sell" us. He was professional, courteous and honest. T.J. was great as well, He wen to bat for us and got us a great deal. John was informative and straight forward. It was a no Nonsense process. I will recommend this dealership to anyone. Plus We LOVE our new Rogue!]
