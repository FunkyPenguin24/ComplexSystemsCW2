[104768035191876842064,100132188231831367297,Excellent skylight repair and done quickly at a very reasonable cost. One of the other two(2) contractors I called for an estimate finally called back to schedule an appointment after Century had already estimated, and finished the repair! Outstanding quick service!! Contractor also went out of his way to fix some additional problems on the roof-- namely some nails that were poking their ugly head through the last roofing replacement. This was also done without additional charge. I highly recommend Century Roofing for such repairs.]
