[104549446373213413570,100824460878939261087,I absolutely love this dentist and his office staff. I will continue to drive all the way from Dallas to see them as I think they are one in a million. I appreciate that I feel like I can trust Dr. Smith to take good care of me, but not suggest unnecessary work that keeps it affordable. He took extra time to talk with me and I didn't feel rushed at all. I felt very at home in their office by one of the very sweet and friendly dental hygienists and also found out we had mutual friends at Denton Bible church. I will definitely be back for their friendly small-town hospitality and great dental care.]
