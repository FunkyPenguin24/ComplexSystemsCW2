[111411575731434751720,100076964223331488417,I have been going to see Dr, Roy Elturk for about a year after having an experience at another dentist office that left my husband and I rather fearful. I have not been disappointed with the change. His staff is very friendly and helpful. The office is very clean and the environment itself is very comfortable. My hygienist today Jessica was very friendly and gentle and the treatment coordinator Gayle is quite helpful. All the work that Roy has done in my mouth is beautiful and you really can't see that any has been done at all. The other side that was done elsewhere,this is not the case. They are also very good with children and are willing to go the extra mile to make sure your child is comfortable and will allow you in the room with them if they are at all fearful. Bottom line, I would recommend them to anyone who is looking for a good dentist or has had a negative experience elsewhere.]
