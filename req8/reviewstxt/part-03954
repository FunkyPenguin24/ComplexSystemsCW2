[113305256261715387755,100366980105382982592,It was the 4 of us that went. 2 adults & 2 kids. Taco Tuesday's! Got 3 street tacos for $3.33. Good...really enjoyed. Got the BBQ Nachos appetizer size a lil smaller than expected. Hubby ordered and I didn't expected them to taste good... didn't sound good to me. But they to were pretty good. Kids got a quesadilla and split it. We were all still a lil hungry. Got a pitcher of Bud Light for $10.95. Wished I had got more food with that money. Total $36 + tip. Place was nice bigger than expected, no lines immediate service, waitress was really nice and manager close by that was courteous.]
