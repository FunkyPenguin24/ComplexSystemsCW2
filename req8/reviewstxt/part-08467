[113626913374384132001,100612017162173015846,Kidz Play here is a great location to keep your kids entertained and occupied. The business is also locally owned. The staff and owners are very friendly. They make you feel welcome, the facilities are very clean, and they do what is needed to insure your time there is enjoyable. Whether it is going there for free play or one of their plan activities Kidz Play is always on our list of choices when thinking of things to go do with the kids. We havent taken advantage of this next thing in awhile, so not sure if they still offer it, but you can also leave your children there to go shopping, out to eat, movies or other - and with all that is around at Concord Mills area that is nice when you just want some time alone, or with your spouse.]
