[101739648746831707664,100639544393916877097,Markenfield dry cleaners took my 2 months old jacket for dry cleaning and completely destroyed it over night. My jacket had huge raccoon fur around the hood and was bright red colour. After cleaning it the whole thing looked as it was run over by a tractor, it was no more fur and colour was washed out. They kept lying about methods of cleaning used, first lady said it was dry cleaned then she admitted putting my jacket into the washing machine, because the hood was soaking wet on my arrival. I don't know anyone who would decide to put real fur into the washing machine!!! She didn't even think to call me and ask if she can wash it instead of dry cleaning. Obviously she didn't care at all. Markenfield owners refused to apologise, they didn't want to tell me who their insurer was until I kept insisting for few days and told them that I'm going to see my solicitor. Really bad customer service, poor cleaning service, bad attitude. Please aware this could happen to anyone who wants their clothes dry cleaned at Markenfields. Well, you can also wash your coat and jacket at home in your washing machine, which will give you the same result, but wont cost you anything.]
