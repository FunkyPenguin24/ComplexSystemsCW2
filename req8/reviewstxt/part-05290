[107470054659240405222,100440725237110660727,The starter in my 2006 BMW went up and I was stranded at Kohl's in newark. I called, they told me what tow company to use and the tow company charged THEM. They fixed my starter and everything was done in a day. They even made a special arrangement so that I could pick my car up after hours. When I paid, they rolled the fix and tow into one payment which made it really easy. I've always gone to the dealership but this place makes me trust the smaller local companies. I'll drop in at Fair Hill Auto next time I need something done next time.]
