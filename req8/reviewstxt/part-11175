[114900495647416501859,100756967568740646634,I had the opportunity to work with the Samuals team when looking for a new home, They took what is normally a stressful and nerve wracking decision and made it easy, informed and comfortable for me and my family. Rowan & Karen listened to my needs and wants, as a single mother I wanted to find a larger home for my family but needed to stay in the school district my kids were currently in. They understood what was important to me, did not waste my time showing me places "just because" as other realtors do and really zoned in on properties that worked for me. The Samuals team were on top of their game sending daily updated listings, demographics and current news of what each community had to offer. Their proffesionalism combined with their superior knowledge of Naples real estate and amazing personalities made this buying experience great! Thank you!]
