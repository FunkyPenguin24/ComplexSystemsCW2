[108770174001853174477,100119548960661140710,Not good experience. I feel like I didn't get what I paid for. I posted what happened with my course and they keep deleting it. I will repost as others has right to know what happened to me. Class was okay , but I feel that there was too many stories, and there was not enough learning. The teacher went off topic and would let students get into some longer talks and not keep on topic. It would get boring then as I didn't find I could relate that to what we were trying to learn. Some more driving education videos would have been good choice over the stories. We did get to leave early both days as it was the holiday weekend and steve had to leave as he said he had dinner plans. I was disappointed that I didn't pass my road test, even though manndeep had said I was ready and I would have had a bit more driving if she didn't take the breaks in most of my lessons. I was out for just 2 hrs, and couldn't you take your coffee breaks before or after you had come for me for my lessons. I didn't like sitting having to wait for you for taking your coffee breaks and also several times Manndeep was on the phone talking in punjabee to her son, and I had to park waiting for her at the curb for her to finish her talks. I didn't make you ever have to wait for me. I did get to drive a nice car, it was a new honda, but she was always on the brake and I was getting kind of annoyed at manndeep, as I didn't think it was needed at all and I have driven lots before lessons. I will practice with my family and then try to do another road test as I didn't pass. The road test can only be done at one registry and only one day specifically. No choices in the registry to do the test or the day that you want to do the test.]
