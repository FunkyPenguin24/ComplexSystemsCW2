[110896073903401428341,100628356972747642677,Doing business with this small shop was an absolute pleasure. I was treated with more respect here than anywhere I've ever been. Jose has extensive knowledge and is very well-spoken. The price was given to me BEFORE the work began...very refreshing to experience this in the realm of automotive mechanics. The end result was exactly as described and exceeded every initial expectation I had. Time, craftsmanship, customer service, and price were all better than I could have imagined. I would drive many miles to see these guys again.]
