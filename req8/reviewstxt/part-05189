[115851682016036128677,100434235561647505716,At first I thought this was a nice place but I was wrong. I went there to have 2 tires replaced and three studs fixed. That is of course a major repair but I could not believe it would take 15hours to do. I dropped off the car at around before noon and I was able to get it at 3pm the next day. I was so irritated because they first told me that it would take 2-3 hours and it kept going on and on. I had to go back to wait twice. I think the technicians are very incompetent or just a poor services. They are the worst. Just do not take your car there, unless if you have a lot of money and no plans.]
