[108091689905591439513,100292139971048702550,I couldn't understand why I was running a full minute and half slower than usual. Pain seared in my hip joint, but I didn't know what to do. Call a Dr? Would he just recommend pain killers? Instead, I found Peak Balance Chiropractic. With just the first treatment by Dr. Harlow, I felt a tremendous difference and was able to resume my training schedule. Dr. Harlow's knowledge of sports and her desire to improve the performance of your body, are just a few of the reasons I highly recommend her and Peak Balance. Dr. Harlow's care helped me rediscover my love for running!]
