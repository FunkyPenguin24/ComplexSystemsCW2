[111856310347703673450,100396893711289564425,After having hit and miss experiences buying used cars over the years, I recently bought my first new car from Gem Mazda. In comparing this experience against my previous dealings with Car Dealerships, I can comfortably say I'll probably ALWAYS be driving a Mazda! (zoom zoom) The sales team is low pressure, accommodating, extremely helpful and they obviosly enjoy their jobs. We took our time, researched vehicles, and were not pursued by the sales team like a hungry pack of honey badgers like we were by other Manufacturer Dealerships. Dave Rohe helped us on our first visit, and Markus closed the deal while Dave was on vacation. Both gentlemen were wonderful. Dave helped me learn how to navigate all the bells and whistles on my car, and I'm a happy camper. Our experience with the finance department was just as enjoyable. (a first!) While we heard the obligatory schpiel about available packages to protect the car, there was none of the playing of games regarding taxation, or fees like I've endured at other dealerships. I was quoted by email an "out the door" price that was fair to all involved. A problem with a vacuum hose in the engine caused the engine light to illuminate our second day of ownership. My first dealing with the Service Deparment was just as pain free as the purchase of the vehicle - they took a hose off another vehicle on the lot, and had me on my merry way feeling confident about my purchase in no time. Keep up the good work, ladies and gentlemen!!]
