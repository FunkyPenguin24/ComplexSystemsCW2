[113875725172281479513,101130147825649043193,We were passed off to three different salesmen. I had a huge down payment almost could pay all cash and have excellent credit and they quoted me at 9% apr. The 2013 hondo fit I test drove had to be jumped. They said this happens all the time. REALLY?! Why would anyone buy a brand new car that stalled twice on the test drive. I went to toyota the next day and bought a 2013 prius C. Got an amazing deal (2,000 under invoice and 0.9% apr). My advice is if you really want a honda go to carmax or some other honda dealer. This place was horrible. I wish there was a lower rating to give them.]
