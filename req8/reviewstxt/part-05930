[105258476011705343416,100473004727044148778,I bought a used car that had significant damage undisclosed to me and Carfax. I thought I could trust a dealer and had no one in town who knew something about cars to help out. When I realized the shape the car was in I tried to get a refund two weeks later. Mr. Carr agreed to fix it, but the AC still did not work among other initial issues. Good service, but I would not recommend buying anything other than certified or new if you must shop here.]
