[110591447648310188732,100866958162384014617,My husband, dog and I moved to Solera in April. We are so happy to live here. The staff is friendly, professional & quick to fix any problems that may arise. They have a great maintenance & cleaning staff. The building is kept very clean. They also are very pet friendly which has been a huge blessing to us. There are professionals of every age that live here so everyone fits in! The location is great. We feel very safe and can walk everywhere. We never thought we would spend so much time outdoors while living downtown. We have a beautiful, updated apartment and are enjoying our time here. Thank you Solera for doing it right!]
