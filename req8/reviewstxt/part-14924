Again, the food is absolutely perfect. The kitchen is well run, every thing I order is spot on. Great portions too. The "lounge" which is just the expanded tables around the bar, is very nicely run. The staff is polite and treat everyone well. What I really like is they treat business people well and that matters because we are on the road so much. I highly recommend Outback in Goleta.]
