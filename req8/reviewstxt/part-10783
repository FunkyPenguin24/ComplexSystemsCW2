[100734435309072652419,100735395564572833489,Great rooftop view of Sixth with a giant sized jenga up there. The "martinis" are delicious and quickly intoxicating. They have some of the best happy hour drink and food specials, even on Fridays! This is one of my favorite girls night out places as the tapas selections are huge and the ultimate girly drinks of fruity martinis.]
