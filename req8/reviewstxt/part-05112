[109033971857084078846,100428970732290013194,This kohls has poor customer service. The employees are rude and unhelpful. The hiring manager complained on a job interview about about how unappealing the job is. She make strange remarks about how she was so glad she was a manager now, so she did'nt have to deal with the people. I make it to the second interview and ended up being denied the postion because I have a criminal background of assult from when I was younger. I obviously did well and they wanted me back for the second interview but as soon as I checked yes for the background, they denied my employment. They disrciminated against me when they told me it would have no affect on my employment.]
