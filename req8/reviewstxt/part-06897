[106360450735935543378,100527500742840022066,I've always had top-notch service brought with top-notch professionalism and at an affordable price from 1-800-GOT-JUNK. My first call to them enabled me to get rid of quite a bit of obsolete electronic equipment. This year, due to logistical problems on my part in getting some bookshelves built and set up, I had to call them twice when I would've preferred to call them once, but that's what it took to get rid of more equipment, shipping boxes and other items and both crews were up to their usual A-game standard.]
