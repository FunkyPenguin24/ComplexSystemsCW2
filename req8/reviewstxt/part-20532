[100583968163032618021,100087418787321615842,Dry Canyon Forge had a booth at Winterfest in Bend, and my son Vito (10yrs) got the chance to make a hook in the 4pm workshop with Hunter. It was awesome. Not just that in a little over a half hour Hunter walked Vito and another kid through the process, and he got to walk away giddy with the delight of creating something from steel and fire; but the way he worked with them, his patience, focus and the pure quality of his teaching made it a joy to watch - and this from his Mom- who has been teaching art for 25 years! She watched with me and was truly impressed, and this from a tough critic. I'm a Builder, and find their work beautifully crafted and thoughtful. These guys are great.]
