[105829884123696613212,100335790722880449440,Mr Bernstein was a pleasure to deal with. He took his time and really listened to my problem. I called several personal injury lawyers in Miami and he was the only one that I felt comfortable talking to. Now knowing Mr Bernstein and his track record I strongly feel that he has more experience than most other accident lawyers. The other lawyers just hung up the phone and essentially said that it was too difficult of a case. About a year ago I was injured in a serious accident in Miami FL on South Beach and was rushed to the emergency room. After leaving the hospital I didn't feel comfortable with the prognosis. The doctor said that I would be fine. Many months passed and I still wasn't fine. After talking to Mr Bernstein and consulting him the end result was peace of mind.]
