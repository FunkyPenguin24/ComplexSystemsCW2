[100323436678725324808,101052792777741378709,Really nice selection, was able to fill in most of the long standing gaps the first time I went in and they have managed to hunt down most of the other issues I was missing. I have not be able to find some of these comics for years. Owner was very knowledgeable, and recommended a couple new series that I am really enjoying. Found that he got to know what I was looking for and recommended things based off my personal preference. Will definitely be sticking with the store.]
