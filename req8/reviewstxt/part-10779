[116361776306559162597,100735247514418580134,Bought a Zoeller Quick Jon 202 Grinder Tank from Zoeller. 9 months later the pump went out. (inside the 1 year warranty). Zoeller will have nothing to do with replacing it. Had to buy another one for $527.00. The rep. (Ryan), said first it was the check valve then it was the venting, blah, blah. 2 independent plumbers said the installation was perfect. Sent 2 e-mail to the public relations person and got no reply at all. Advise: don't trust their warranty.]
