[100191494033340301191,100295719727047216789,I have purchased two vehicles from Dave Smith motors and I rate them very highly. I traded in a Range Rover in 2011 for my new Denali and they beat my local dealership price by almost 10k. A year later I purchased a new Durango Citadel and again they beat the best local dealer price by 7k. I had the Durango shipped to Seattle for $400, it was a seamless transaction.]
