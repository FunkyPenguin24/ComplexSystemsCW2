[102393882920219983110,100287132865288248226,This is the worst "hotel" I've ever stayed in. It isn't even a hotel, it is a motel with outside entrances to the rooms. The room was dark, dank and musty (probably from the thriving mildew colony growing in the shower). The room is tiny and cramped. The mattress was cheap, hard and lumpy. The pillows are very small and uncomfortable. The coffee pot in my room hadn't been cleaned since the last guest and there was no coffee anyway (except for decaf). The breakfast consists of some stale packaged danishes and other bread. One morning there wasn't any orange juice or coffee. I wouldn't stay here again even if it was free.]
