[100221117259261603207,100666425577551733667,I live in Las Vegas and I came into Reeves to buy my car because they are the BEST. I always go to see salesman Mike Khoury. This is my second BMW from Reeves, and Mike is the best. I knew I wanted a car I just didn't know which model, what color, etc...luckily Mike has the patience of a Saint because I am not the easiest client to please. Mike is very thorough, and made buying a new car easy. He even shipped the car right to Las Vegas. The next car I buy will definitely be a BMW and I will always go to Mike.]
