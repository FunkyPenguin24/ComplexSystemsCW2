[102455925580983516752,100406693527221566913,I could not be happier with our experience w/ Nicole and Behind The Lens Maui. Nicole was so outgoing and really made everyone feel comfortable for our family photo session. The location was fabulous and her talents really shined in our pictures. She was great with the kids and really helped bring out their personalities. Our session had to be rescheduled due to spotty weather and she was flexible with our desires and plans. You will not find a better, more professional, photographer on the island of Maui. I am hopeful our paths will cross again down the road.]
