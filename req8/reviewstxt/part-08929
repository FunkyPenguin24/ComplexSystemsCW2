[109125213848789518611,100634955713046732367,Doreen recommended a unit sized on my furniture description , reviewed the pricing and showed me two units. I rented a 10 x 15 and am very satisfied. The property is spotless and in a nice area. Doreen next reviewed all the documents and I was finished with the transaction very quickly. I will recommend this facility and Doreen to all my friends needing storage in Las Vegas. JME]
