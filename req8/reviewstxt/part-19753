The bend and everything was right below my window. And how can you sleep on a wedding night? I had to leave the hotel at 7:30 for a meeting on Saturday. On the evening before I have asked how is the breakfast served. I was told that on weekends it only starts at 8 (if)., but I will be taken care off. In the morning nobody knew anything about it. At the end I was offered a donut from a wending machine.]
