[105547204457908592140,101014323053192677053,The best nursery school in Beacon. Developmentally appropriate activities, wonderful attention to individual children's needs, and a great staff. Don't go here if you want your kids to do worksheets all day: they will play, paint, sing, listen to stories, learn to get along with others and to follow directions. This is the stuff kids really need to learn before they enter school!]
