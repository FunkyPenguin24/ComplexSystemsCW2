[109486121658014826638,100621809373803840034,I had some issues with a ceiling fan in which the light stopped working one day. After taking it apart I didn't quite understand what the problem was. I called them to ask for advice and replacement parts. They were helpful over the phone and even more so when I came in. Their advice was solid and they were friendly. I wouldn't hesitate to ask for advice or buy parts from here again.]
