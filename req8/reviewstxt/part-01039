[100153455845329063456,100212873249320122355,I love Tool Town Pizza, but I must say that I really, REALLY miss how they used to make the pizzas before the current owners. I used to be able to almost polish off a large pepperoni pizza all by myself. It was that good. I still give them a 2 though, but beg them to try and make it like they used to!]
