[111914949127633817434,100447688421667933596,Have known Zack now for nearly 8 years. He is a leader. Zack is consistent Real Estate Professional with the track record, diligent, and result that is bar none. I believe he will always have his client best interest at heart. I know whatever problem any home buyer or seller is facing during or before the transaction, Zack can help you manage and resolve it. That is his greatest value and asset, solving problem and getting result. I would highly recommend Zack Alber.]
