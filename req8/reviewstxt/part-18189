[117398546335284924438,101140221630553528919,Worst McDonalds I have ever been to. This review is based on years of sporadically going down to my local maccas, and having them stuff up the order more often than not. In fact, I think I can only remember 2 occasions where they got it right. They never put pickles on the burgers unless you ask, and when you do ask for extra pickles, the smart a$$es think its funny to put a soggy handful of about 20 on there. They frequently, and conveniently forget to give you certain items that you've paid for, and half the time, you bite into it and it's cold.]
