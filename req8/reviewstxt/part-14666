[101328996374356746103,100948239680658806526,Philly Pet Care took care of my kitties for a few days while I was out of town. I was very happy with the level of care, and when one of my cats was suddently not feeling well, Dave and Kristie took it very seriously and kept me posted throughout. I will be happy to call them again when I need cat sitting!]
