[109423240704014365455,100834924123862568381,My children and I use to go through Oak Creek Canyon in the late 1980s and the 1990s traveling to and from Parker, AZ. The entire canyon area was a splendid example of God's generosity toward His creation! The slide rock area the first time I found it was like a fantasy! That was way back before the parking lots and then the State Park title was bestowed and removed much of the magic from the area!! We all remember our side trips to Oak Creek as wonderful adventures, especially the times we camped and relaxed near the Creek. For those who have come after, well, they just can't truly experience slide rock or the Canyon... Now It is 'civilized' and has a 'price' on what was once free... Too bad! Same think for Jerome, AZ! What a mecca it too was at one time!!]
