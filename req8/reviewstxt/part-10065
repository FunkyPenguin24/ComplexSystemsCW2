[109848853758254991012,100696699802970393548,As soon as you get on the lot, ask for Sim Luu. My wife and I were interested in getting a 2014 Prius Plug-In. We were first met by Sim, who came off as genuine rather than the stereotypical car salesman. As we went through the car-buying process, Sim laid out all the details for us and our financial options. I really could not have asked for a smoother car-buying experience. Sim was actually able to make it enjoyable. Next time I need a car, I will be going straight to Sim again.]
