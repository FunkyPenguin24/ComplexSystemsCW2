[101869798442195346342,100034535086531960616,18 months ago Audio Express installed a factory Sat receiver in my Mazda (They were recommended by the Mazda dealership.) It recently stopped working. Audio Express gave me an appointment (yes an appointment!) to check it out. They had to take the car apart to get to the sat module and determined that the module itself had gone bad. At my request they took the module out of the car. They buttoned it all back up and told me to come back when I had a new module. NO CHARGE!! That is twice they have now taken my car apart with no damage or sign of any kind. I'm definitely a repeat customer.]
