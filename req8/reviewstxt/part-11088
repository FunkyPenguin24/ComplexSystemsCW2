[113936427525458014065,100752566316723748645,The atmosphere would be a great place to take a girl out for a nice dinner with the lighting and wine selection being perfect for the occasion. My evening started with a good service with a Jameson/baileys and Veal meatballs as an appetizer. The drink had more Jameson than baileys so great drink and the Meatballs were great.The first dinner plate (MINE) : The special, poached tilapia and rice; rice came out dry as if it has been in a warming container but not closed and i was served the top portion, but the tilapia was cooked well. Dinner plate 2 (Hers): The fettucini Alfredo sauce was watery with little taste. How do you screw up fettucini Alfredo? Thats the easiest entry to make. Im not one to complain but I paid $52 for this meal and I wouldn't care if my food sucked as long as hers was good because I am trying to impress her but she didn't even like it. Ill try it one more time before I never go back and hope that it was just a one time thing.]
