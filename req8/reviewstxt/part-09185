[117957190140040415420,100648770740455297803,I'm still a beginner with aquariums. This was my first time at the store, outstanding poor service. I was a new customer in an unfamiliar store and felt invisible. The place smelled dirty and was dirty. No one expressed any interest in helping out whatsoever. In fact the staff seemed more interested in ordering take-out than helping us out (Beef and Broccolli). As I was meandering through the place with an infant in her carrying seat, the same employee who was ordering take-out wordlessly squeezed past us before I could get out of his way, forcing a cramped and awkward situation. I decided to edit down my shopping list to a bag of gravel and a new filter stone. This is the first and last time they will ever get my money. Guess what folks--Petsmart is right across the street.]
