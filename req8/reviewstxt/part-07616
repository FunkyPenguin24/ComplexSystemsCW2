[113521703358707461362,100565914565318029095,We just got our springs replaced after a breakage, and used Garage Door Specialist. We're very happy with the work they did. They upgraded our springs (longer lasting, longer in terms of length too), replaced our noisy bearings (we hadn't realized how noisy they had become over the years), and set us up with a 10 year warranty. They came when promised, and were done quickly. We couldn't have asked for better service.]
