[102322343572906712666,100332842995747118975,Gillman does not support their Veterans.( At least not this one) We have purchased a car there and I have refered friends and Veterans to the Gillman organization, and get all of our servicing there for 5 years now. Today that stops. Because I am a Disabled Veteran my credit is not the best. My husband and I are needing a second vehicle, so of course our first choice was Gillman Nissan of Fort Bend or Gillman Honda of Fort Bend, how ever, I was told today by Chris Gillman, that I could have the car I wanted, If I paid my bills. I went to Chris because I was insulted and upset by the General Manager Pete Harvey on an earlier prospective deal and made it clear I did not want to deal with him again. They do not have my best interest at heart, and was just looking to make a sale]
