[110655415321010315566,100071359665704046831,While driving down to Manhattan from Boston, we randomly pulled off an exit in search of food for lunch. My friend who is familar with this route said unless there was a billboard stating there would be some place to eat, then we shouldnt pull off the expressway. I decided to test my luck and saw what looked like an old victorian house just off the exit. We walked in and were blown away by the place. From the waiter who treated us like we were royalty to the food that was fit for a 5 Star Resort. Everything we ordered was top notch and I'm sure this is the best kept secret just outside the city.]
