[100223027115105073757,100570920375938874080,My husband and I took my parents here for dinner last Saturday. It was a great dining experience. Between the four of us we had chowder, chicken and pasta, ribs, a New York strip steak,one hell of a baked mac n cheese with salad and delicious hot bread and butter for the table. All were cooked well and you could feel the love in the food. I would recommend to anyone and look forward to working with them on future banquet business.]
