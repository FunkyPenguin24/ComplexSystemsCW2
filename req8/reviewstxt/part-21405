[112897754582012474163,100135083457001961733,We had our son's 13th birthday party at Xtreme Challenge in Thornton a few weeks ago, and my kids (and his 15 friends) are still talking about what an amazing time they had there. We have heard, "that was the best birthday party EVER" more times than we can count! The Xtreme instructors were a lot of fun, but also committed to keeping the party safe, which was very important to me. We have already booked parties for our younger son's party and our older daughter's partyâ€”that's how much fun we had!]
