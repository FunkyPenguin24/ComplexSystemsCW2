[103213776291266933193,100362796344112059392,The Myakka River is a beautiful backdrop for this campsite. The folks behind the desk at check-in, check-out are fantastic! However, campers are almost on-top of each other whether in a tent, trailer or RV. While the few tent-only sites face the water, there is no privacy there, as folks park their lawn chairs on the other side of the water to fish all-day-long and watch you. Alcohol is permitted, which seemed to be the catalyst for 6 middle-aged, extremely disruptive campers to pound beers both Friday and Saturday nights (nobody is at the site to keep campers in-check)...enough to make me never want to return to this campground. I had complained at the front desk Saturday morning which didn't change anything, as the misbehavers did not alter their inconsiderate behavior for their fellow campers the second night. I went to chill out for the weekend and returned home frustrated and angry I wasted my time at Camp Venice Retreat.]
