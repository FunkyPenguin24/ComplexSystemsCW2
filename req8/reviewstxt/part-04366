[114907152894482807355,100391053763436518923,Had a problem with my cell phone battery and they didn't have the replacement in stock. They did however spend 20 minutes fixing my phone and got the battery to actually hold a charge so I didn't need to buy one. Says a lot about a place when the people there are really motivated to help versus just trying to make a sale. They will be my first stop from now on for anything that they carry.]
