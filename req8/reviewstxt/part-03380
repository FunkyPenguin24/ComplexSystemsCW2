[104258467093421047710,100333634978824362986,Curtis, and his team at Evan's Automotive have all their ducks in a row and them some! We took our Grand Cherokee in for regular maintenance, and during his inspection one of his tech brought our leaking rear axle to our attention. His tech explained the importance of replacing the seal, and with his information we were able to make a decision to replace the seal before something worse happened. The pricing was very reasonable, and I've paid a lot more for worse service at other shops. The staff at Evan's is some of the best I have ever dealt with and we are happy to take our vehicles in for service because we know we'll be treated with honesty, and intriguing. And don't forget the cleanliness of the shop, everything is spotless!]
