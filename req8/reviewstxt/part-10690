[110108618620174358450,100731040407038787927,Cryousa was a welcome relief. I am in my late 30's and constantly put myself to the limit with jiu jitsu. Not only that, being a college athlete and an airborne in the Army, I put a huge beating on myself for the last 20 years.. I could tell the difference in my joints as well as an overall relief from day to day stress. I evened managed to drop a few pounds. I highly recommend this treatment for those weekend warriors and anyone else that is looking for an alternative to painkillers and shots!]
