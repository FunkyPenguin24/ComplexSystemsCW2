[103911726999190180439,101090653635013620954,I was so impressed with Dr. Wehling's philosophy of holistic healthcare and how he worked with my daughter that I made an appointment for myself. I was really surprised at how quickly my pain was reduced. After only 2 visits I felt a major difference in my neck, shoulders and hips. Dr. Wehling understands how the entire body is interconnected, and effected by lifestyle factors such as nutrition, exercise, water therapy, rest and stress management. His office provides a pleasant, relaxing environment â€”with convenient location, flexible scheduling and a great electronic check in system that tracks your medical history and progress. Dr. Wehling combines scientific knowledge with innovative, natural care that is totally personalized...and the results are amazing!]
