[100380991917533650226,100898005872267339646,Stopped in for a quick business lunch. Service was efficient and courteous, ordered the Angus cheeseburger and fries. Burger was cooked as I ordered it (medium rare), fries were obviously fresh cut (not frozen from a bag) and I was very pleased. So many places promise good burgers and FAIL, but Tommy's served up a nice fresh upscale burger at a fair price. I'll start bringing more customers there.]
