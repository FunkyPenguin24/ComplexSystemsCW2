[115778205891022871809,100111376179942846319,Super yummy, crab Rangoon soooooooo good! They have chili and plum sauce. Most Chinese places do not carry plum sauce. Went on my Birthday and they gave me a small piece of cake and a cream puff. I'll be a customer when I'm in the neighborhood! And the staff are nothing short of courteous and sincerely nice. Highly recommend. Plus- they deliver!]
