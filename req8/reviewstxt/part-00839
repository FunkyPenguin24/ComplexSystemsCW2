[100727520869944765182,100202581941499471609,I have been going here for more than a decade with all of my cars. They are honest and reliable. One good story is that I once brought my car in because of a side-blinker malfunction. It was an older car and I had assumed it was non-trivial (flasher, wiring, etc). Turned out after inspection it was a light bulb only! They charged me $2.10 and nothing else. Once I found these guys in the late-90's, I have not taken my cars anywhere else.]
