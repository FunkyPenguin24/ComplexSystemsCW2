[107050843811528319777,100576834065313269599,In 1985 I put my mother up in the hotel when she came to visit from Florida; during the historic circus parade event; mostly to see how her grandson was growing; she loved it so much; the hotel; she wanted get a suite there to stay; she had taste; My son had his rehersal dinner there about yrs ago before the wedding the next day @ the Milwaukee Club; family from around the country and world enjoyed the hospitality; Recently my 5 yr old granddaughter chose the restaurant patio area for our monthly visit and breakfast was fabulous and so accomodating; such great atmosphere on the lake area from a still historic; comfy; hospitable establishment for all! Thanx, from Morgan, her dad and grandmother!]
