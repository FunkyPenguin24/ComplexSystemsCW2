[107682183651371445576,100912387280916494722,I am one of those rare individuals who actually enjoy going to the dentist. This was not always the case, and this odd behavioral abnormality started in the summer of 2003 when I first attended Champagne Family Dentistry at the insistence of my father. Their staff wrote the book on customer service, their workplace is spotless, and they seem to always be upgrading their equipment to be on the front lines of having the cutting edge technology. Even when I lived overseas (in Italy and Guam) I would wait until visiting home to make sure my teeth where properly taken care of. Well that is not entirely true, to my everlasting regret. In order to make sure my dental hygiene was up to date, and I was not able to make it to Champagne Family Dentistry, I opted to use a different dentist. My experience was nowhere near what I had with Champagne Family Dentistry and reminded me of why I used to hate going to the dentist. In closing, I live 1.5 hours away from Champagne Family Dentistry, but still make the drive (3 hours both ways) three times a year because they are just that good.]
