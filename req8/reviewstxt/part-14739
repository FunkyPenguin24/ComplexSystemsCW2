[109290557182508753626,100952530553093973363,mcdonalds cabuyao as of nov 18, 2013 is still under renovation. i hope that the management have done this earlier so that it may serve their customers prior to holidays on december.... still mcdonalds is more likely to have a number of customers rather than those of mang inasal, jollibee and chowking. (sister companies). anyways, as far as i can see, now, they're renovating to serve more customers and to have an enhanced customer experience, i like the new concept of the building.. i hope that there is also a second floor. ^_^ it's like a view deck like the one's with jollibee in front. ^J^]
