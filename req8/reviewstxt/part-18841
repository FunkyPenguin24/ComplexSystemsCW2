[106233022854210188266,101174621761679607867,Fully agree with the other posts. The pharmacy is sub-par. On several occasions I have called and talked to their staff and they "guarantee" something will be ready at a certain time and that they will call you.... I never get the call and the prescription is rarely ready on time. Seems like it takes forever to fill prescriptions.]
