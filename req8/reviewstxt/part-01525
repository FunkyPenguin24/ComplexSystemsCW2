[111229433102140704532,100237131157033782518,I was expecting a large building with well stocked showroom. I didn't get that but I wasn't bothered. It soon became clear that I had made the right choice. I have a 'grey import' Toyota Regius mpv and had decided to go for s s/steel replacement rather than Toyota's conventional box. Right from getting the vehicle on the ramp everything was discussed about what I wanted, how it should sound and how it should look. I ended up with a dual exhaust -instead of the standard single - that ended in two very nice oblong end trims. I tried the round ones but the oblong were more in keeping with the shape of my rear light clusters. Tried a couple of boxes to hear how they sounded and ended up with the slight "growl" I wanted. Mine is a diesel so I wasn't going to get aV8 soundtrack. I got exactly what I wanted at a very fair price. No hesitation in recommending these guys. They are passionate about what they do and what their customers want.]
