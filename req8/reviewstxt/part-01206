[111999284132914619672,100221696423450155519,I have been going to Dr. Clark for about a year now and my chronic neck/back pain has gone away. I love going to the office and getting adjusted. It doesn't take long and the staff is friendly and accomodating. I used to have neck pain when turning my head from side to side and lower back pain that would radiate through my whole body. Dr. Clark showed me some easy postural changes that have helped a ton, and the adjustments give me the relief I need to feel better. I injured my knee (dislocated patella) several months ago and wouldn't have thought to go to a chiropractor, but Dr. Clark has helped for it far more than any of the physical therapists I've seen or anyone else. The massage table thing they have you lay on prior to the adjustment is super rad also. Highly recommend!!!]
