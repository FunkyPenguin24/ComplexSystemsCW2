[108047401750818108418,100197763976748390471,I did business with these fine folks a couple of years ago when I was taking care of a sick relative. Wow, what wonderful kind caring people they are. They went above and beyond to make sure we got the best equipment and always with a reasonable price. If they did not have what I needed, they would direct me to other sources as they just now did today over the phone. They treat you like family. May God Bless them !]
