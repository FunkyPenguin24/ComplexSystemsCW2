[114554493557671631487,100005317452678215479,The thing I like most about Lifestyle Homes is their ability to build my clients a home that feels custom for an affordable price. Because Lifestyle offers such a wide array of choices in cabinetry, flooring, counter tops, exterior siding styles and colors, tile, door and trim style etc.... my clients can have a home that reflects their taste at the standard price quoted on the floor plan they choose. Lifestyle delivers a home that is unique to the client -even on a stock floor plan - without charging upgrades on every finish. I appreciate that!]
