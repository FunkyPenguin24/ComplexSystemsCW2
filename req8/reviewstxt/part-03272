[101102470442400912759,100327936687527642008,I show up to Dunkin Donuts every morning and get the exact same thing. The people are very friendly, however, whether or not I get the right order is hit or miss. The problem is always my coffee. I ask for the caramel swirl coffee everyday. I look forward to it. They don't put in the caramel swirl half the time. If there was another DD close to my work, I would go there because this is ridiculous. Especially when I repeat that I want caramel swirl, they act exasperated because I said it a second time, and they still forget to put it in the coffee. It is not a complex coffee order. It is a matter of putting the syrup in a cup and pouring in the coffee. I have not gotten my caramel swirl coffee in a week. I finally decided to review them. My take on the establishment: great people, but check your order because it probably won't be right.]
