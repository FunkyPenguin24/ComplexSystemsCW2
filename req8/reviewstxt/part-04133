[107928801261353203410,100377439677595082194,When we arrived everything looked ok. when we were ready to go to sleep we found a pair of socks in the bed, so that means they didn't clean the sheets after the last guest. I talked to the manager and she told me that she was going to clean the room for me. The next day when we were getting ready to take showers we found out that the water heater was not working, it was untli 1:00 pm when we could start our day and get ready to go to sea world. I understand a water heater malfunction but not washing the sheets after each guest that is just wrong.]
