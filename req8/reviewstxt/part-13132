[102560826538215274933,100864984777465528888,Another first class meal served by first class customer care staff. I have been to a few Indian Restaurants in Fife, and can honestly say this is THE best in Fife, and maybe even in Scotland. The quality, quantity, presentation, and taste of food was absolutely spot on. (Peas Pilau Rice is to die for, my wife reckons the garlic naan is too garlicy??......you can never get enough garlic!) I have eaten there about half a dozen times in the past couple of years and have never been disappointed.....really should go more often.]
