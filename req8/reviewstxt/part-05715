[100997847176091279771,100462073452180529255,Worse DQ ever! They are way over priced. They water down the ice cream and the hard shell dip. They NEVER get the order right and argue with you if you try to sort it out. It is never clean and the staff is rude. I love Dairy Queen but this location in Maricopa is horrible. The price of an ice cream cone is about 70Â¢ more than in Phoenix. One time I ordered 2 double bacon cheeseburger combos and when I got home I only got 2 tiny burgers and when I went to sort out the order, they argued with me and said I'd have to pay the difference. When I told her (shift manager) I paid $18 for for the 2 combos, she refused to give me my food. She asked for my receipt and I told her "you never gave me one".]
