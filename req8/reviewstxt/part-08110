[101111740767097049391,100593651492135775280,Until tonight, I would have give Johnny's 5 stars hands down. However, tonight's experience was so horrible that I will never return to the Hideaway, nor will I think of it fondly. There was a some mix up over our bill and for the most part that was resolved with one server. We tipped generously on top of the gratuity to try to make up for the mix up. Then, another server demanded that we pay her gratuity as well (long story). When my fiancee refused, we were treated as if we tried to rob the bar and the server. Not the case. This particular server had a poor attitude the ENTIRE time. Service gets zero stars. The one star given goes to the crowd and fun that I have had. If you go, order from the bar. The servers are horrible and the attitude is worse.]
