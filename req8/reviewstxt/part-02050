[114111349622581228444,100264907865961994746,My first experience with Stonewater was a much needed brow wax. I had been working 70-80 weeks and didn't have time to keep them well maintained. I couldn't find a single salon that would fit me in with almost no notice. When I called Stonewater, Daryl worked hard to get me in that morning. Before I arrived I was concerned I would be rushed through and they wouldn't take the time to find out what I wanted. I was wrong. Alicia found out exactly what I wanted and took the time to do it right. I scheduled another appointment with Alicia to do my hair just two weeks later. When I returned I again felt relaxed, and was able to get exactly what I wanted out of it. Alicia made my hair look AMAZING. I have never loved my hair. It has been unmanageable, heavy, frizzy, and sad for quite some time. Alicia give me a new style, and found a way to make it look sleek, light, and beautiful (even when I am at home). I will be returning. Their prices are in line with other salons and spas in the area and their service is incredible.]
