[103963674215706477190,101058540260363206266,The office at Broad St. and the one overlooking Central Park are both chic and comfortable. My physician, Dr. Jani, is an NYU grad and an internist who seems good at spotting problems before they can develop. She is also personable, as are the half dozen or so front office people I have dealt with at either office. (She moved; I followed). I lived 20 years in Cali., and this is a Cali. based operation, with a pleasant, nearly laid back vibe. I sometimes come a bit early and linger just to look out at their amazing views, the kind you see in movies. Never did that before in a doctor's office. If only all doctor offices were like these!]
