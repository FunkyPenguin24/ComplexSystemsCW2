[104066791528585848891,101112494172659692751,I'm placing an official red stamp at this location. I am not going to "chance it" anymore. This location has permanently lost my business! Reasons for negative review: 1. No warm welcome, greeting, or smiles from staff. 2. Staff got my order wrong. How can you get a Number 1 with cheese wrong? I got a hamburger without cheese and extra onions. 3. No apologizes from staff. 4. Long wait to get first order. Long wait for second order. 5. After the extra long wait to get my order, I asked them to make it "to go" and they didn't. I had to ask again. 6. Cheeseburger and fountain drink (regular Coke) had an unusual taste. (Praying to God they didn't poison me.)]
