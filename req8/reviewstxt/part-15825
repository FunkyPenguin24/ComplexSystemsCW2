[100502578835415542227,101011469466327392892,Having just recently been burned by Kal Tire i returned to Green and Ross with my other car. First time this location. Expecting the worst, desk manager came out to parking lot, inspected my tires and reassured me that replacing only one tire was necessary. He had an easy in to hose me resisted and the rest of the visit was as i could only have hoped it would be. Nice to get real service, genuine desire to deliver and no nasty feeling youve just been had. Thanks]
