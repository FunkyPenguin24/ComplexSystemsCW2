[100504138885874116855,100894398195608246440,I don't eat at this Subway anymore after my mom, dad, friend, and I all got sick twice after eating the sandwiches from here. Girl working here messed up the order 3 times on one sandwich and messed up another one. They really need to start training their employees better here and maybe not leave the lettuce, tomatoes, etc sitting out on a counter all day.]
