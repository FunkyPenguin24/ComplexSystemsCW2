[100900670792857258981,100727362476400999359,The Montessori Scholars Academy is a true gem. I visited the school in March of 2013. The building is brand new and the atrium is built specifically to minimize allergies, maximize natural light, and have fresh air flow. The safety of the building is quite secure, with a keyless entry code at the entrance, a check in and out system for the children, and an emergency system in place. The playground is big, clean, and safe. The kitchen was exquisitely clean, and the menu for the children very accommodating to allergies and dietary restrictions. The attention the teachers pay to the students was very impressive. You can tell they truly care about the education of the children and the success of the Montessori system. If you have any doubts about the place, make an appointment! Ms. Veronica, the school director, was extremely accommodating to my last minute appointment request and gave me a thorough tour of the school and answered all of my questions regarding curriculum, education, and philosophy. This is a world class facility, right outside of Atlanta!]
