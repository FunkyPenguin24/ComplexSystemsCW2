[114471659807915960497,100384960734918717059,My husband and I are very low key people so we decided to get married at our local Justice of the Peace in Fullerton We had always wanted to try Chomp, so we took our best (wo)man, my 4 year-old niece and 15 year-old nephew here. They treated us like family! The food was reasonably priced $30 for the most expensive Teppan meal, and they made an unforgettable day even more so!]
