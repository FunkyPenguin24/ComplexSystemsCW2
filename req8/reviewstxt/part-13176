[110875716247481824232,100866854783954888809,Johnny: Did a superb job of getting me to arrange things in the house and for me to get rid of many items in the out building so the new buyers were willing to get a mortgage and to buy my property, after I had moved everything out of my house November 1, 2013. I was very happy to close 21 February 2014. A good job well done. Weston W. Haskell]
