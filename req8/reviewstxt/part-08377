[109990285602870063977,100607610752946840359,I had to mail (2) oversized checks and was concerned that they would break. Jacob helped me out and took care of everything. He recommended how I should package it the most cost effective and safe way. Both guys were great (the one with the hope tattoo on his arm), greeted me when i walked in and were super friendly/helpful!]
