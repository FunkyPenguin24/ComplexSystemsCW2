[112878759592056591083,100451337339240072088,Charlie is one of the gems of the East End, a great character and just as important a great barber. You will not be disappointed with the service and the cut. Best still is the price which knocks spots off the barbers at Canary Wharf! I always jump on the DLR and slide over during a break. A word to the wise, cuts are by appointment only, so book or you may miss out.]
