[102854425377264250887,100096110593676124540,This LA Fitness, provides only the basics any gym provides and there has been no attempt in my 2 years as a member to provide a clean, well maintained and organized gym facility. I am a tradesperson and as the weeks go by no attempts to repair basic small damages or keep a regular detailed cleaning schedule has occurred. No soap in dispensers, dirty paper towels all over the facility, weight plates strewn across the gym on the floors (first thing in the morning!), old shoes and clothes rotting in the changerooms for weeks. Really not up to par. Water fountains have gone unrepaired for months and equipment stays damaged for weeks. Sinks are filthy, lockers broken, toilets are disgusting Poor management, not recommended at all. They really need to shape up, worst gym I've encountered yet.]
