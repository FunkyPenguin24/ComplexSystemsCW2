[114611570463022020653,100351285019634418373,I went to this place yesterday after my pomeranian seemed to have gotten into my trash and eaten something that made her sick. The doc took a look at her, asked a few questions then looked at me and said he can do xrays or blood work, but he didnt know what was wrong with her. So I said whatever you recommend. He said I'll run back and schedule some blood work. He quickly walked out of the office. At this point, I haven't received any estimates on the cost, I'd only been told the exam was $49. I get called up to the desk to get my dog and then am told I owe $500! The doc didn't tell me he was taking xrays and no one told me how much it would be. I feel completely taken advantage of, my dog is still sick and now I'm out extra money for the holidays.DO NOT GO HERE. It's a complete waste of time and money.]
