[107908586574457370565,100456696385413560833,Just hit this place up, friday night with friends. Had 2 open tables. Service was prompt, and the food was... Surprisingly great. Some of the best hamburgers I've had in a long time. Beer selection was likewise excellent. Atmosphere was different than what would be considered typical Portland, with clean interior, lots of wood, central bar. Plus the servers were *Very* cute. Recommended as moderate priced restaurant.]
