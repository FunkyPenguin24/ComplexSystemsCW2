[114028053291449035508,100287904518895743380,Absolute worst service ever. Ordered a pizza last week and they forgot our drinks, which showed up 2 hours later. Tonight we order a pizza and are told it will be an hour to hour and a half. 2 and a half hours later, all we get are excuses. Pizza finally shows up, cold as if it was took off a buffet. I gave the delivery guy $5 to take it back. They declined the tip and took it back for free. Should have took it because that was the last chance this Pizza Hut ever had to get my money.]
