[107389264206934238019,100659266502385330245,Dr. Nemec & his staff are very supportive of any health concern, issue and will go out of their way to help patients with any health challenge. I have seen patients heal from all varieties of health issues ranging from type 2 diabetes to Chrohns disease to cancer. Dr. Nemec is very versed in nutrition and has numerous entities of education for patients. His purpose of teaching towards patients is phenomenal. Total Health Institute is truly a mind, body, and spirit center and again has a large emphasis on education especially nutrition and thorough understanding. Would recommend to all family members!]
