[100406026090041476866,100487750862442397737,Worlds Series game night, the restaurant was packed with excited fans. I told server Anthony that my friend and I wanted to watch the game (2-3hrs) and he commented, "OK just take care of me". This was understood but he could have avoided saying it. I decided to leave after being jserved during the bottom of the first inning after dinner because I was not prepared to buy drinks for the next few hours to make good on the request to "take vv of him". Once finished, the check was delivered, and there was an extra entree charge of the chicken wing special. Because It was the special for the evening the entree fee could have been missed had I not paid attention to the check. The extra charge $14.00! When I confronted Anthony he behaved as if he knew about the error. I felt Anthony was trying to take advantage of the spirit of the evening. He may have made extra gratuity by voiding off the entree after we left the establishment adding the 14.00 as the tip. I'm commenting because, I believe this is a very bad(fraudulent) practice and patrons should be aware of this alleged deceptive behavior. Keep your eyes on your checks at this place. Also the food was hot and the table was tacky or sticky as if full of hardened old grease. The floors are slippery. Please clean up your place!]
