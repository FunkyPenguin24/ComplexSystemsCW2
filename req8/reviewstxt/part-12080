[101439702767379496119,100805906420990440859,Heidi Clark was the most amazing sales associate. I was shopping for several different models and makes of cars. Heidi's no nonsense, supportive approach. I sincerely felt like her number one goal in my purchase was to get me into the right vehicle to fit my lifestyle and transportation needs. I was treated with respect during the whole transaction. I cannot thank Heidi and the Fusz team enough for the ease of this process. I can honestly say that I was not treated this way at the other dealerships that I visited. I have had my Kia Soul since July. I love it! It is a joy to drive and I can really load some serious cargo in the back. Thanks again to Heidi for her caring and professional service. Sincerely, Sherry Smith]
