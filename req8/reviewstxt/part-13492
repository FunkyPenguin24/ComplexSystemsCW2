[101347285148346312494,100884810105352994119,My mother, 83, received expert care at the hospital when she broke her hip during our visit there in Summer 2012. She received a partial hip replacement, and everyone, from attendants to the hospital's social worker, nurses, doctors and chief surgeon all gave optimum care to my mother, and kept me, her daughter, who was with her at the time, continually informed in detail about my mom's needs and the procedures she would undergo before, during and after. We were and remain grateful to the expert medical team at Maui Memorial. Mahalo, one and all!]
