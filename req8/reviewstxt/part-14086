[100126556943771561844,100916526229094448445,Turn the Page has so many levels of help it blows my mind. They can educate you so you can do SEO, blogging, and social media on your own, or they can do everything for you including press releases. You pick the amount of interaction you want to have and they will do the rest. It is truly amazing. They are better than having a full time employee whose only job is to get you noticed on the internet. Unlike an employee who get complacent and does not like to learn new things, Turn the Page is constantly evolving. Their staff is top notch. They enjoy their job and their enthusiasm is infectious. No matter how good you think you are doing, they will take you business to a whole new level.]
