Some of the behind the counter servers seem pretentious when you ask for items to be made different than THEY like to make them. But really, they aren't serving themselves, they're serving customers so you'd think it'd be the other way around. Also, their website says nothing about their kitchen not opening until around 11:40 am... I guess if you just want a coffee then you're all good.]
