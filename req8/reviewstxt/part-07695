[109205858210813088843,100570825218970370703,Three years ago I went in for some crown work. It was disasterous to say the least. I have never been happy with the fit and the ordeal of having it put in was painful. I had to go back twice as they couldn't get the fit right and even after that it was clunky and the Dr. had to grind it and play with it for an hour to FORCE it to fit. I have two other caps that are fantastic from a dentist I used to use in Indiana. That was nearly 15 years ago and they have not budged. Now, about 3 years and this one pops off! I will NEVER go back to Dr. Prasad.]
