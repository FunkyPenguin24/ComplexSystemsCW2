[109619685315848976122,101063831866713038657,When our 02 Durango had a leaking head gasket we decided to trade. We worked with Mike and Camillo and came up with a deal on a Caravan Crew Plus, it was a great vehicle but after a month we missed our Durango so we went back and worked with Mike and Camillo again trading the Caravan in on a Durango Citadel. Of course this was sort of complicated but Camillo and Mike helped us through it. Special thanks to Brenda for getting us through the paperwork on the two transactions and following everything up. Also thanks to Sam who did the delivery of the Durango to help Mike out. We also have to mention Anthony as he was always a friendly smiling face during the time we spent at Unique. We are happily on the road again enjoying the Durango experience and hoping it lasts as long as our first one. Looking forward to dealing with Unique Chrysler with our future service and maintenance.]
