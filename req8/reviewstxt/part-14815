[104342577429799894125,100957148412003581628,I highly recommend that you do NOT bring your car to this shop .They "fixed" my Subaru, but after driving it for less than 10 miles the Service Engine Light stared blinking, When I called them they told me to bring it back in, They didn't listen to what I was telling them, they jumped the gun & went for a $1,700 head job instead of a manning up & saying they did the job wrong in the first place. And on top of that, they told me it was driving fine... Ummm no it's not, I know it's my car.]
