[111850174365537353170,100529554709469034122,Okay, I admit it. I purchase "seasoned" vehicles. I only purchase vehicle brands that I know are serviced by Franklin Automotive. Over the past 14 years, we have purchased 3 Volvo sedans, 1 Toyota and a Lexus. Franklin Techs have pampered them all. Because I trust Frank and the guys, I am not afraid to drive my cars well past the 100,000 mile mark. Their prices are fair and the service is beyond exceptional. I recommended Franklin to my mom. Now, no one but a Franklin technician touches her Avalon. She is more of a Franklin fan than I am.]
