[100774676298951399724,101050563660721719913,Way out of line with the pricing!! Pasta dishes should not cost $14 at a pizza joint!! The food was ok at best and the service was horrible! I went there with my girlfriend because she had gotten pizza there before and thought it was very good. That may be so but stay away from anything else. The sauce I had on my tortellini tasted like it was from a can. She had baked rigatoni and again it looked as though they poured some prego over some noodles, added some cheese and baked it. For the prices I think the quality should have been a lot better.]
