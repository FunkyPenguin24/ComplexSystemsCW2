[105700390263573305483,100972430365839531277,To the review below: Have you never purchased a car before? They are trying to get the best deal from you just as much as you are from them. It's a big game, no matter where you go. I've used Ferman Chevy for their car services as well as bought a car here and been nothing but absolutely satisfied. When I was buying my car, we were trading in another car, we haggled back and forth, which, like I said is par for the course, and got the price we wanted for our trade. We also got them to come down on the new car. You just have to be persistent; welcome to the world of car buying! The salesman are all professional, and typically very upfront about what reality is, not to mention knowledgeable and good looking! I've never had a bad experience here, nor do I see that changing. As soon as you pull in the parking lot someone is eager to help you, not to haggle you, but to do their job and help you find what you're looking for! If you live in Brandon or Tampa, or any of the surrounding areas for that matter, this is your place!]
