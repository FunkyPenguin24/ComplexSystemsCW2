[101785074112653490467,100509493359928137677,This review is about Wells Fargo as an institution and not about the specific branch. While checking my balance on line, I accidentally signed up for a service that had a monthly service fee. I called the bank to cancel the service. I was told I could not cancel the service online or over the phone. First, I had to go to a branch and set up a password then call back. I explained I signed up without a problem and asked why it was so difficult to cancel. To comply, I went to the branch and set up a password. I then called the bank. As of this moment, I have been hold for over 50 minutes listening to the phrase: "The next available banker will be with you as soon as possible. Your call is important to us and will be answered momentarily." I do not believe I am important. It is way to hard to engage in simple transactions. I also believe the bank intentionally does this to generate revenue. If it is hard to stop a service, the bank makes more money.]
