[107131945591191444350,101000108150276146206,Lorca is undoubtedly the best coffee shop in Stamford. They are continually bringing in new flavorful roasts that perfectly compliment their variety of soups, sandwiches, and baked goods. The baristas are also extremely knowledgeable and take the time to make perfect espresso drinks. The shop is small enough to feel cozy if you're trying to relax but large enough to accommodate a group of people if you're having a casual business meeting or catching up with friends. They also offer special order full cakes, pies, and other desserts with several gluten free options.]
