[100217646972981141257,101065558897701531336,While goung through training in Newport, I decided to partake in sone seafood and saw this place along America Cup Dr. Thought I'd give it a shot, and had an enjoyable experience. The service was very good. I had the crabcakes, and they were all right...more breading than crab meat. However, the seafood casserole I ordered was outstanding. I would recommend that dish to anyone who likes the thought of fish and shellfish together in a dish that isn't fried. The price is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good.]
