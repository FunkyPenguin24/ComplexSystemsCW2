[109165042013458438296,100632515392022884489,Dr.Cass is the best and kindest hearted vet! You will never be rushed in an appointment. You will never go in for one thing and be convinced your animal needs a thousand other treatments. She will take the most hollistic approach possible, while still being practical and making sure your animal is taken care of and gets better. She is understanding and accomidating with scheduling appointments. I feel so lucky to have her taking care of my pets!]
