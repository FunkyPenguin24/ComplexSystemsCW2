[105431932988503877372,100869224497155798744,BUYER BEWARE!!!!! STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!!!!! I went into the dealership looking at the 2004 Mazda Rx-8 that was listed at $9995. So of course i thought what a deal? So i continued to pursue the car and i get to the dealership and the price in the window was $11995. Now that didnt scare me because most dealerships online pricing is the final "Sale Price" which i was okay with. So as im looking at the car i noticed a few problems and asked if the rusting rear archs could be fixed which i was told it would be fixed at THERE expense. So after test driving and feeling the car out i felt as though $9995 was a fair price and my sales consultant agreed at 9995$ is a great deal. As i continued i asked for a "out the door" price. A few moments went by and my sales consultant came back to me with a price of $13,200. Shocked as anyone would assume i was wondering whats with the spike in price? They came back and told me that they had to replace the engine (KEEP IN MIND THAT WHEN I TEST DROVE THIS CAR THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT WAS ON!!!!! IN A BRAND NEW MOTOR!!!!)and that costed them alot and the rust removing would COST ME MORE money so the price was 11995$. so i left the dealership in complete disgust because $13200 was no starting point on a $9995 car. As i got home i was eager to do some research on this car and come to find out MAZDA PUT OUT A RECALL ON ALL MOTORS From 2004-2008. ALSO MAZDA DID A RECALL ON THE REAR FENDER RUST. ALL OF THESE COSTS WERE AT MAZDA'S EXPENSE BECAUSE IT WAS A RECALL. THERE IN NO WARRENTY NECCESARY FOR A RECALL!!!!!!!!!! So i called back the next day to see if something changed, maybe they'd like to reconsider and be fair and sell a car. So i called the and acted as if i never looked at the car and i was told that my sale price out the door would be $11,100 from a salesmen with 4 years experience. And i asked him if he could double check that price with his manager and he said trust me ive been working here for 4 years, that is the best we can do. NOT EVEN 30 MINUTES LATER I GET A CALL BACK SAYING THAT THE PRICE I HAD GOT THE PREVIOUS DAY WAS THE PRICE I HAD TO PAY. Then i asked well what was that price? And he said that he didnt know. It really just goes to show that there sales floor is full of liars and people who will try to rob you blind. All in all, Dont fall for there scam tactics. This place is bad news.]
