[115026210551580898623,100943112234979263711,I have lived in 4 cities and have had a number of dentists over the years. Dr. Savitsky is, by far, the best dentist I have ever had. She is a phenomenal practitioner - highly skilled and truly brilliant. But, for me, what is more important is that she will help you make the best decision about your options. She will not (as many dentists do) recommend (insist) on the most expensive treatment option. She will help you consider the timing, cost and results of any procedure. I have been seeing her for almost 7 years - my daughter sees her as well. If I could take a photo of my teeth and include here - I would! Plus (this is a bonus) - Dr. S and her staff are wonderfully helpful and friendly. A visit to the office is an enjoyable experience in every way. Look no further - once you are her patient, you will never leave.]
