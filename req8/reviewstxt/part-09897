[103526764433466366990,100687570064014854204,I have been to this place a couple times now and I can say that the folks working there are unprofessional; I think the manager herself is unprofessional. The hairdresser *will* try to sell their Matrix line; other reviewers have voiced the same feeling. On my last haircut, I mentioned that I was using Nexus and I happened to divulge that I purchased it from Sams. Oh boy what a mistake, the lady went on and on - products sold at Sams is expired, it is a closeout store so components would have deteriorated, middle people mix different stuff into the products. What !! She wouldn't take any explanation from me .. and had nothing to back her theories. She extended her views to all stores like Sams, Walmart, Costco. In essence, anything bought else was fraudulent. Back to haircut; the haircut was not good. My hair was left zig zagged; the hair dresser also didn't have all the clipper sizes.]
