[106468646417947579206,100604726926611690775,I've been coming to Dr. Brakes on and off for the last 2 years or so. I've only gone to them for major service/maintenance and they never disappoint. Mike is always doing his best to inform, educate and equip consumers with better understanding of what needs to be done. He's not overly pushy like other service centers I've been to and always keeps me informed of any issues that arise. I would recommend Dr. Brakes to skeptics and anyone in need of service for their cars.]
