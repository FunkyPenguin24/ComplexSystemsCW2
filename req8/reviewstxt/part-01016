[100623633863406671060,100211781198703127160,We recently worked with Don as our real estate agent in purchasing a new home. We started our search August 2012 and ended with the purchase of a short sale that began in October 2012 and closed in the beginning of January 2013. Don is personable while still being a professional. He was always available to show us homes as they came on the market and always answered my many emails quickly. He knew what we wanted and didn't let me settle when I started to lose hope that we would find our dream home. You always hear how purchasing a short sale is a tedious nightmare, and I didn't find this to be true. I know it's because of Don's hard work and keeping everything on schedule. I would highly recommend Don to anyone of my friends or family. Thank you, Don. I couldn't be happier in our new home!]
