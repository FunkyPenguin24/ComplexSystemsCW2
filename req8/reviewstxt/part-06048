[112043128286173318328,100480067428377115400,Have gotten takeout from here over the past couple of years and have always been happy with the food quality, selection, and price. One time I asked the owner if he served duck, eliciting him to serve something of menu that was delightful and prompting him to have a conversation with me about the history of China over the past century. Totally unexpected, and awesome! Friends and I ate in the dining room for the first time this week and it was well worth it. Family meals and the " Imperial meal" were abundant, tasty, and a great value.]
