[118328390979431479049,100434248585111478141,Do not trust this company! They came, spent 20 minutes, charged me $207 to tell me my compressor was out and I needed a $4500+ entire new unit. Got a second opinion and found out they had removed the capacitor from my unit and took it with them. This made getting an opinion from another company difficult (which I am sure was the idea!). When I called & demanded my capacitor back, I was given one that was not from my unit. They also gave me two different stories as to why I had to replace my entire unit and not just the compressor. Stories turned out to be false. Will never do business with Fowler again!]
