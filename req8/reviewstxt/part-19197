[103699128555087521353,100016058810472785239,This florist sent the wrong arrangement than what i ordered and paid for. I ask for a refund and they said we sent it out and the customer loved it. The guy on the phone did not want to work with me or give me a refund so I would use them again. But he didn't want to work with me. So watch out what you order it might be wrong and they will not do anything about it.]
