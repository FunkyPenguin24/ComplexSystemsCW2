[109258679309981511659,101004554128699499978,Compared with CalFit, there are advantages and disadvantages. The price is awesome at less than a third, people go there to work out instead of be the "mom's social club" although you run into large groups of the Affliction/Air Jordan crew that loves to go in huge groups and fill up the place, always plenty of cardio machines...Disadvantages would be that some in demand machines only have one unit and bummbells only go to 100. All in all, I'm glad I made the switch and am better for it. Desk staff is friendly and hours are great, I always go before the crowds.]
