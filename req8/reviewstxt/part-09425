Service is mediocre at best, there are a couple people who do their job well but good luck finding them. Parking sucks, product selection sucks, this sears just plain sucks. I am honestly surprised this store hasn't closed down yet. Get it together! This store should be on par with the suburban stores, Oakland deserves better.]
