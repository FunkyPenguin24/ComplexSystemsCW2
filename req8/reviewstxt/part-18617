[108921505380296800979,101162299374517615665,Dr. Fehrenkamp is a wonderful doctor. I've been seeing him for a long time and he always takes the time to talk to me about how I'm feeling and I feel like he really listens to me, rather than just nodding and looking at his watch so he can see the next patient. I've been to several endocrinologists in the area and he is by far the best.]
