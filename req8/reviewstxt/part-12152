[102455016614120636056,100809129750951891127,As a single female, dealing in the world of buying and selling cars is worse than going to the dentist. I steel myself before entering a dealership, knowing I will be treated "less-than" a man and that every attempt will be made to take advantage of my naivete. Well I was in for quite a surprise when I walked in to Lithia Toyota. I was immediately referred to Jerry McKeen who put me at ease right away. I spent the next hour and a half with Jerry as he worked to try to work out a mutually agreeable deal. He understood what I wanted, where I needed to go financially, what I was attempting to accomplish. Although I was not looking for a brand new car or anything that was going to net him a big sale and commission, he treated me with the utmost professionalism and kindness. Jerry was absolutely wonderful. I have always been a Honda girl, but after today I may be crossing over to Toyota! Thanks, Sonja R.]
