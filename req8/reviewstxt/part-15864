[114308253501958867395,101013673631473635589,Dear Bobby & Danielle, A huge THANK YOU for all of the time & energy that went into making the 3 rings for Alisha & I, (especially her absolutely stunning engagement ring!!). It was our friends who initially recommended you to us, now we get to highly recommend you to others. We're both just so pleased how everything turned out, we very much look forward to having you as our lifetime jeweller. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you again. Ben & Alisha xx]
