[102813212664232367291,100586166955313100172,Lakeside Farms is one of my favorite restaurants of all time. I sometimes drive more than two hours to have breakfast there! The apple fritter is the best on the planet, and the environment is so friendly and wholesome. Go there and give them your money.]
