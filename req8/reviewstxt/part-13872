[113492643611061279438,100903722549351884714,We sat in a booth where the wall was only partially painted (classy). Waitress brought me pecan pancakes instead of oatmeal pancakes as I ordered and then tried to tell me they were oatmeal. They were undercooked as well. My wife ordered potato pancakes that were thick heavy, soggy and over seasoned. We were overcharged on the bill at which time they said that we saw the price on an outdated menu that they had on the counter. Lots better places to eat in Elmhurst.]
