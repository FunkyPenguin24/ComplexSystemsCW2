[102004928387348348936,100635152078116385044,We recently moved to the area, but have been visiting for many years. The Royal at Heysham is a lovely old pub which serves fresh, home cooked food from a menu which changes regularly and a good variety of cask ales and good quality wines too. The menu is split between their standard menu which in itself is very nice and their daily specials menu featuring fresh and interesting dishes. We always order our food at the bar where we find the staff very helpful and friendly and have never waited too long for our food, which, bearing in mind is freshly cooked always comes in a reasonable time (If you want fast food go to Mcdonalds). Their fish and chips are to die for with a huge, lightly battered fish, fresh cut hot chips and wonderful mushy peas. If you're in the area make sure you give it a try you won't be dissappointed.]
