[106007477488832247427,100589838981758112476,I absolutely love working with Diego Molina. His creativity is outstanding, with a real eye for detail and setting up the perfect shot. Diego is very kind and patient, and he takes the time to explain what he's doing. I had a particularly challenging shoot where a wedding cake was placed in the reception room on a table against an open window on a bright, sunny day. I was so amazed the way Diego was able to capture the true color of the cake with no shadows. The detail shots are breathtaking. I highly recommend Diego.]
