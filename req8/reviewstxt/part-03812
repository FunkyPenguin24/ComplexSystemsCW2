[109919326656552693876,100359429825877523503,I haven't worked out in years but I tried out BodyBar and LOVED it. I was sore and it felt great. I had a blast. It's a small class and the instructors spend a lot of time making sure your form is correct. It's a full body workout on the Pilates type machine. HIGHLY recommend! It's worth it!]
