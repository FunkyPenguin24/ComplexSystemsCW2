[102764703771434477708,101062523603266238467,Not much to say! The place is the BEST! The food is always consistent and excellent, and the special items on the menu like the scallops, tea smoked duck and chilean sea bass are the best! Decor is very cool - just gives an extra bit of ambiance. But the staff are outstanding! I've been there dozens of times and never had bad service. Whether at a table or at the bar, the service is friendly, professional, always on their toes - again, not much to say! They are simply the best!!]
