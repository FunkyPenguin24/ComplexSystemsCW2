[112804456127774060030,100427323661357762555,I arranged for a rate of $49 plus tax over the phone and in an email correspondence, but when I showed up, the reservation wasn't there and the clerk wanted to charge me more. After negotiations, I was able to keep the price at the agreed upon rate of $49 plus tax. The walls and ceilings in the rooms exhibit water damage from roof leaks and the water pressure in the tiny showers is terribly low. The bedding is outdated and not fresh. The clientele is generally described as seedy. The worst part about my visit was coming home itchy to find out that I got bitten by bed bugs and may have to call pest control and wash everything. Trust me, spend an extra $20 and stay somewhere else.]
