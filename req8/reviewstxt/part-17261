[101401438826072480986,101090416178940323976,When I met with Severine about the wedding I told her that our wedding style was going to be a little be less structured and more "improvised" than the average wedding. I asked her to go with the flow. We did schedule some picture time with my family before the wedding though. The result: AMAZING! the pictures we have seen are truly beautiful and me, my husband our families and friends keep telling us how beautiful the pictures are! Severine adapted to our wedding style perfectly and it shows!! Thank you for your great eye and professionalism!!]
