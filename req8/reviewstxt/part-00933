[107837686909494420227,100207631587808591516,We have been going to Capos for years. We usually go there for special occasions....the staff is friendly...the food is usually outstanding...once it was not as good as usual but reading the reviews below it seems to me that someone is trying to sabotage this place. I love Capos and in fact, im going to buy a gift certificate for friends of mine to go there this week. As far as ambiance...it doesnt get any better. The food is amazing too. I like their old location much better than the new one for ambiance. I will continue to go there.....for the food and experience....i dont think theres another local italian restaurant that compares. On a side note, the owners could be a bit more friendly.]
