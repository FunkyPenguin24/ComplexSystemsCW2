[112061192482378428752,100256783903829229522,There is much to love about this establishment. We ventured into this place because we wanted to try the newest brewery in town. The beer was fantastic and the food was really good too. Best part is that we never had to wait for a table. When my family was in town they kept asking if we could go back to Brew and drink Fiona's (coffee stout). I would recommend Brew Pub to anybody.]
