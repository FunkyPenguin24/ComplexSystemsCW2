[113534610637214392573,100887222242412857903,I would give it a negative 1 if possible. Got treated like a number, not a person. No personal touch, no diagnostic test before asking you to leave it for service. Just what's wrong, you have to leave it for 3 days, and if you have anything important, you may want to take it home and back it up because it may get lost. Then at that moment, you have to make another appointment to bring it in, because you have to take it home and back it up. And the appointment isn't the next day, its a few days away, maybe a week away. Doesn't matter that your mac had smoke come out of it, doesn't matter that its on fire, your just a number, not a person to them, get back in line basically. Terrible store.]
