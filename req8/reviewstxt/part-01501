[102295570850852636882,100236436833555509214,We had Custom Closets & More update our closets in 2012. The experience was great, from beginning to end!! Everyone involved from the office staff, to our designer, to the installer were courteous and professional. We have sent several friends to CC&M and all have been very pleased!! A couple of months ago we decided that our garage needed to be updated. So, naturally we went back to CC&M. Once again, awesome service from beginning to end!! We can't say enough good things about the people or the product. We very highly recommend Custom Closets and More!! They are 5 star all the way!!!]
