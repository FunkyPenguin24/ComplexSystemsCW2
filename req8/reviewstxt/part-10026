[112163847996380312175,100694723381575700947,Craig Holten came to visit us at our new home soon after we moved in. I was a little overwhelmed by the advanced septic system that was already installed on the new property, as I am new to home ownership (apartment dweller). And with my husband being unfamiliar with such aspects of water provision and maintenance, we wanted to make sure we understood what we had on our hands. Craig was absolutely wonderful! He was patient, thoroughly explained how the system worked, and put my mind at ease. I was well informed and able to explain it all to my husband when he arrived home from work that evening. I would definitely recommend R&K Septic to other home owners in our area. LaToya S.]
