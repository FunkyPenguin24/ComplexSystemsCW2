[105266860822521972290,100025655415646683792,My experience in the Verizon Store on Rengstorff in Mt. View yesterday was outstanding. You know, we all expect to walk in and get immediate service and then get help for as long as it takes to solve our issue... well, these guys did a good job of making me feel connected and served, even while I waited. It's a real balance for 5 staff members to make 12 people feel like they're all being taken care of at once! Chris, the manager got involved to assist the sales rep with some of my more intense issues. I'd recommend this store if you need professional service and attention to detail.]
