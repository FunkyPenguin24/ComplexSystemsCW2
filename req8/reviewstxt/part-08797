[103820702852822085958,100627668689586304778,We had a family dinner out, six of us. There is very little to criticize, even if I tried hard, about our dining experience. So I will start with a tip. The restaurant has the temperature of the Mediterranean. Wear clothes even in winter that can be removed. The owner loves his job, he & his staff make everybody welcome, young and old alike. The d√©cor is based on the area in southern Italy of his family. So to the food, under normal circumstances I find it relatively simple to work out the best part of the meal. On this occasion, I cannot. It was all great. If you would like genuine southern Italian food and wine in central Scotland this is it.]
