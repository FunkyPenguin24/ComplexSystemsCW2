[102737394137809032460,100246542438197344568,I had nothing but issues with this gym. My first meeting with my personal trainer he was very pessimistic about my goals, despite having reached said goals in the past. I gave them a second shot on the personal training side and they cancelled without telling me. The schedule they gave me when I joined was outdated, causing me to miss gym hours. The air has bad circulation and there are no fans. If you want to do a real cardio workout prepare to sweat profusely. Also, they brag that they have good patrons who wash down the machines, but beyond that the gym does not take any extra efforts to clean down the machines. They look dirty (maybe not as dirty as other gyms) but I've seen much cleaner. They're also extremely slow at fixing machines that break. If you want to quit you have to put your notice in over a month and a half in advance or they get to charge you (even though I left town). I was hoping that paying a steeper price I would get better service...not the case.]
