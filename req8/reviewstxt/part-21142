[114059412565300606387,100120287991138006999,I came in over Christmas with my two sons and my dad. Shannon met us at the counter and talked us through selecting a pistol to rent and shoot. She answered all of the boys' questions on the gun, and they were quite confident when we started shooting. Before we left we ended up ordering one of our own! I have been back several times since and always look for Shannon to help me. It gets busy in there sometimes, but the quality and professionalism of the staff is worth it. Thanks again Shannon!]
