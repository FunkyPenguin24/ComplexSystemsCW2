[100864929854344432853,100219871956610523095,I eat at JeJu sushi all the time. I found the place through some friends after being a little disappointed at some other places around town. Recently I saw a couple bad reviews online and felt I should speak up and stand up for them. I have been eating at JeJu for over 5 years now - I love sushi and probably go at least twice a month. They are always friendly when you walk in as all the waitress and cooks shout "welcome" in Japanese (not that I can pronounce it - ha ha). I normally sit at the sushi bar and talk and joke with the chefs. They are awesome and really know what they're doing and are very authentic - the head sushi chef is actually from Japan. The waitresses are great - always been super quick and friendly for me. I'm always trying new stuff and asking a million questions and they always have a good answer for me. I've never had a bad experience and I've dealt with them all. I read one review about an angry manager - I don't even think they have a manager there so it seemed weird - just the owner as far as I know. The owner is also cool - always walking around to say hi to customers. We always take our big birthday parties and other gatherings there - everything I've ever tried is so good and it's an awesome social atmosphere for a fancy night out on the town or just dinner with a friend. I would happily recommend JeJu to anyone who loves sushi, asian food, sake, knowledgeable staff, and a classy night out - you can't go wrong. It's the only place I eat sushi anymore. Hey - and maybe if your lucky you'll see me at the sushi bar - come say hi.]
