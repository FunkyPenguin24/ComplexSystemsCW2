Dr. Freeman explained everything to me thoroughly before my surgery. The surgery went extremely well and each day I could see my face improving bit by bit. By day six I felt good enough to go out to a movie. After four weeks I could see a beautiful me emerge. No longer did I see jowls and wrinkles on my face and neck. My face looked so much younger. As I type this now it has been nearly 6 weeks and I absolutely love the way I'm looking. I really appreciated Dr. Freeman's positive attitude from the time I went to interview him. Everything I anticipated and hoped for with this surgery was made possible because of Dr. Freeman. He did an excellent job on my face and I am extremely happy. I look 15 years younger. If you are thinking of having anything done to your face, I would highly recommend Dr. Freeman over anyone else. He is a remarkably skilled surgeon and a very thorough doctor.]
