[104611174487726404885,100391954441822917193,My experience with Scott and Merchants Auto started when I spoke with him online using their instant messaging tool. We set up an appointment and I agreed to process the on-line credit application. (this made the whole experience painless.) At the time of the appointment, we were welcomed at the door and ushered to Scott's office. He was not pushy at all during the initial phase of our discussion, and agreed to get two of the vehicles we talked about and let us test drive them. We were allowed plenty of time to look them over and poke them, and the test drive was illuminating. We ended up taking home a car that afternoon, and every step of the way, Scott had the next thing ready to go and explain. There is, of course, a lot of paperwork, but Scott made it quick and easy. Truly, working with a professional who knows his business is a rewarding experience.]
