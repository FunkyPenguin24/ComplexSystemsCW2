[105987801704523508368,100735354807904784563,I have attended a few Business Networking events at the Forsgate Country Club. It is a beautiful place, nice atmosphere, and pleasant people. But what stunned me the most – it’s a great food! Last time I was there I have ordered a turkey club sandwich – it was a best sandwich I ever had, and French fries were amazing too. Before that - I had no idea that fries can ever surprise me!]
