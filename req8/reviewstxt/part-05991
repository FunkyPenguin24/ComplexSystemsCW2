[113527275191819640606,100476817184186336776,Good experience, but lacking in price catagory. They are as strict on pricing as the Austrians making the darn things. They need to lighten up a little. And all the hype to give them "all 5's" for their ratings is a huge turn off. I am a Quality Manager for an aerospace company and if I asked my customers for "all 5's" they would laugh at me as anyone remotely familiar with a continual improvement program knows that a true measure of quality comes from honest feedback.]
