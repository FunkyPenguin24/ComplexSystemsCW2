[101079823446612045228,101043912343090570374,Traded in an SUV for a Lease- We got a good value on our trade in and awesome rate on a lease for a new Honda Accord. We decided that economy was more important than luxury at this time in our lives and this reduced our monthly expenses on payment and gas by over $400/mo! It was a tough decision but we were given all the time and space we needed! Debra was great and addressed all of our concerns!]
