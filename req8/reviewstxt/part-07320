[115516971284888497108,100550510582323996312,Mozingo Photography is the way to go! When it came time to selecting a photographer for our wedding we knew that the Mozingo team would be fabulous. Competitively priced and such a great value. Both Meriah and Michael have a keen photographers eye and can really capture all those special moments that might have been easily missed. Their process from start to finish is flawless and so professional. They take their time to sit down and get to know you and the event that you're having and what you want. Their day of event presence is calming in the way that you fully trust what they are doing. My wedding contained some spirited characters who sometimes are hard to reign in for photos but the Mozingo's were champs. They are the kind of husband and wife team that would you want at your event regardless if they were photographing it or not! We were so happy with the outcome of our photos. The photos' were so excellent that our wedding was chosen to be featured in a bridal guide for our area. The best thing about using Mozingo Photography is not only do you end up with awesome photos that last but you will end up with a friendship that lasts as well! I'd say that that is money well spent!]
