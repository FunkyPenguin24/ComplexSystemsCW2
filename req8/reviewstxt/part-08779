[104920046366123361155,100626944688624023585,Was unimpressed with hotel. Lobby was well done, but nothing but mirrors everywhere...the real hotel starts appearing when you step onto elevator with fake linoleum floor and it gets worse. "Partial Ocean view" actually means if you hold on to rail from balcony you can see some water. It is however in a nice location, but that did not make up for the fact that the walls were paper thin, then deadbolt on the balcony door seemed to have been kicked out and then painted over (obviously noticed and ignored), there was even an exposed outlet in our room w/o a cover behind the bed (dropped phone and had to move bed). It was fairly priced, but can do way better for same pricing elsewhere - and will next time.]
