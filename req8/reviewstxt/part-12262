[109195314940356981991,100815231075991141699,The BEST weekend in Michigan! Of course it's crowded.....that's what makes it fun. I love the display of patriotism, the amazing firework display on Saturday night, the carnival, the ships to explore, the art fair.....NOTHING about it I would say I didn't like! Check it out for yourself, and NO...I do not live in the area or have a vested interest in the success of this Festival; just have gone to it for many years and wouldn't miss it!]
