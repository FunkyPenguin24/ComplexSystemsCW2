[107445474781154834610,100920880446725365027,I ordered cremation jewelry and was so thrilled with the appearance and quality I immediately ordered a small onyx urn and had it engraved. I expected to receive it in 5 or 6 days. Three, yes 3 days later, the box was waiting at my doorstep!!! It is Beautiful!!! I would Highly recommend Perfect Memorials to anyone looking to memorialize their loved one. For quality, reasonable prices and great customer service, Perfect Memorials can't be beat.]
