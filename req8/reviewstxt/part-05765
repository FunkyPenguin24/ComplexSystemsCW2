[106006934376876932885,100464883028553990111,If you are looking for great BBQ, then you need to find the Carolina Barbecue Shack. It is hidden behind the University Grill. Take the road beside M&M Tire and find the sign. Take a right and drive on back to the building. They offer pulled pork, hash, beef brisket, and smoked turkey. You will want to add a baked Potato and barbecue beans to that plate with a roll. They have a Shack Sauce, which is a ranch/sour cream based sauce with a hint of garlic that is so good you could probably use it to eat a rock. It tastes great on everything. You will be hard pressed to decide which BBQ sauce to go with, their signature Carolina Barbecue Shack Barbecue sauce or their Carolina Gold sauce, which is a mustard based sauce. They have lots of sides to choose from but the baked potato with the Shack Sauce and barbecue beans are my favorite. Don't want to cook supper, go by and get a Family pack. When they first opened there were picnic tables outside. Then they added an awning for the tables to be under. Over the last couple of years they build a nice building with beautiful tables, air conditioning, and a big screen TV.]
