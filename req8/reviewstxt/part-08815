[112943484939631664367,100628623502678973411,The new location is gorgeous and the staff is always so nice to work with. Dr. Cappucino is the best - he makes you feel so at ease, he truly listens to what you are looking to accomplish. I have to recommend the Crystal Peel soap specifically to anyone with that icky dry winter skin - I promise you will love it! and I just starting using the Obagi products and am very pleased with the results. LaBella Medispa makes you feel like you are in a 5 star luxury resort spa and its right here in Mt. Airy!!!]
