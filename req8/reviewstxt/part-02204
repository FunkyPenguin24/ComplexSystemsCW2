[102551663950999812087,100272776728315644008,Have bought several (no less than 7) mid to high performance PC's from them as far back as 2008 for use in my home and business. All of them are still up and running without issue. The last one I bought had a power supply start acting flaky after a couple of months and even though they could not duplicate the problem in the shop, they still replaced it, no charge. As far as I'm concerned, they have always gone above and beyond to serve their customers well and to deliver quality computers and equipment.]
