[100100602447258323138,100980645926959710526,You truly never know what you will find at the Habitat Wake ReStore. It's a great place to shop as a DIY Home Updater for furniture, appliances, building materials, and more. Plus all the proceeds come to Habitat for Humanity of Wake county to support our mission of building homes, communities, and hope. Also, shopping and donating to the ReStore diverts of 3,000 tons of materials from the landfill every year. A great store with a great mission and a great impact on our community. What better way to shop local?!]
