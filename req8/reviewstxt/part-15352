[109214320634084842262,100984902707368517027,Very unwelcoming experience, rude and couldn't care less staff. It is not to the standards of Sheraton. This is the only hotel in SPG that I found which does not identify guest as spg member and does not care to know. Being an international visitor to Sydney, this hotel refused to accept corporate international currency card which even small corner shops accepted all over Australia and I was left with no option but to foot the huge advance on my personal card. The staff had absolutely no sense of responsibility, and did not hesitate from arguing and staying on with their rehearsed unhelpful statements. I would not advice any international folks to visit this. To top it all, the room service menu had 1 Indian item, room service charge of $7+tax in addition to bill, and food was not good (taste, presentation, freshness,.. on all counts).]
