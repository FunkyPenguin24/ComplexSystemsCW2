[116726557094359318681,100997765074255053000,Tortillini soup was great. Pizza crust was just my style - hard and very dark brown. The sauce was just as good - tasty and no one taste was overpowering. We ate at the College Park site twice in three days. Sadly we had to leave or else we would have eaten there more. When we visit our son and his wife again - Russo's will be our go-to place. You have a loyal customer.]
