[102751082912091074460,100365201225725359671,Terrible school. Financial aid has no idea what it's doing and it took me 3 years to graduate for a 2 year Associates when I was going full time because they kept putting me into classes that I didn't need. Classrooms are way too small, and overall it's just a nasty place.]
