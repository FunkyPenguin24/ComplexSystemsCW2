[106961459917876140138,100849827938681260728,So I gave my new Amazon card to the gym guy and asked him to start charging my fees to Amazon. He did. Found today that I've been billed on the old card and also on the Amazon card. A 98.00 overcharge. Double charge started on the day I gave him the new card. Gym manager says it's my fault for renewing on the computer website. They will not reimburse.]
