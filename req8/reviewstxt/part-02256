[101959260074777920195,100275735324240304311,I went to Michelle about three weeks or so ago for the first time. I had just been going here or there to get my nails done and never realizing how much better they could have looked. One trip to Michelle and they look spectacular!!! I have naturally long nails and Michelle was able to do the acrylic overlay on them without making me cut them down like other places and helped me to get them shaped right so they didn't look horrible. On top of this, Michelle went through all sorts of great information with me on how to really care for my nails. She showed me where some damage had been done to my nails by salons that don't take the time to properly do them, and helped me get on a regimen to get them back on the healthy track. One of my absolute favorite things about Michelle's nails is that she mixes her own acrylic powders. Any color you can think of - she can do! So, you don't have to worry about it chipping or fading or wearing off. And her nail art is simply awesome! I swear that this gal can do anything you ask. When I went in to get them filled, I showed her a few pics of nails that I liked on my phone and she was able to come up with something unique that I totally loved! Her prices aren't anything higher than what you're going to pay at a crappy salon, and I'll tell you that I would happily pay more just to go to her anyway. Not only does she have a very clean, sanitary shop, but it's a very relaxed, laid back, fun place to go. Michelle has a wonderfully awesome personality. She'll be the first to tell you that she's been doing nails for over 25 years and it shows in her work and her attention to detail. I will never, ever go anywhere else. Even if you don't live in Owasso (I don't), it is beyond worth the drive over to see her. She also does pedis and reflexology! Go see her!!!]
