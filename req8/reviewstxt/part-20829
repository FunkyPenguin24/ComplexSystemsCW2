[107323429627832696086,100103489146444727339,I took the course for AdWords and the Analytics course in New York and the 5 days were an excellent investment of time and money. I was able to immediately take my learning and apply it to client programs that I was running. The 3rd day of Analytics is very technical and I would not take that again because I did not need the programming information. Other than that I have been able to use everything I learned to make our ad programs and our web pages more effective!!]
