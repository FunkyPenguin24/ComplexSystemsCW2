This guys got a practiced touch that only experience knows. Try the sedation it's as if your watching (minds eye) yourself get drilled on TV. NO PAIN. Like a well run, classy, professional office environment - Run, don't walk. Want a Dentist and Staff that are smart, patient, empathetic and perceptive to your individual needs - Pick up the phone! just saying - my mind has been forever altered as to the perceived "negatives" of the trip to the Dentist! Thanks for the Big Smile Doc, and company! Mike Newman - Dallas]
