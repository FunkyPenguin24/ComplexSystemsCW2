[116854676068960567449,100172747369206283660,We bought a used Cadillac CTS from the dealership. The car was in excellent condition, the transaction went smoothly and Laura Singer was a great salesperson to deal with. All our questions were answered and faster than expected we were on the road again. Thank you so much! A car buying experience can't get any better.]
