[104075802216435051376,101013235730726220148,Went there for a $35 3 course meal which was absolutely amazing! I had the masala seared scallops, tiger prawn and scallop main dish (with garlic aoli and black bean rice pilaf) and finished with a dessert of pot de creme - a small portion but sensibly due to its extreme richness. Everything was top notch including the service from our server, Will who was one of those rare gems that takes pride in delivering an exceptional experience. I also had a caesar and it was, perfect. Would highly recommend.]
