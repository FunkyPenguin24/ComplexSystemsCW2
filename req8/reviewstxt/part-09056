[114923699173144558979,100641810539153860551,When I walked into the shop, it impressed me so much on how clean and tidy it was that I booked an appt right away. Caitlynn helped me that day and I went back the next day and got a new tattoo and another tattoo fixed (not orig done by anyone in this shop). She was very pleasant to work with, she took her time to explain everything even though I have several other tattoos and know the drill. It's always good to hear it again. My new tattoo turned out perfect! I love it!! She added and cleaned up my other tattoo and it looks great too. I've already gotten several compliments on them! I've booked an appt for another tattoo with Caitlynn. I highly recommend her and this shop. I've been to several different shops in the area and this one blows everyone out of the water. My husband is now going to go and see Caitlynn about a tattoo he wants. Thank you to Skin City Tattoo! And Thank you very much Caitlynn for the best tattoo!!]
