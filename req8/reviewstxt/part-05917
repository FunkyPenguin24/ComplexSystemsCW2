[105859788457977997794,100472415208740857185,Listen here FOODIES: You will want to try this place. It is really--really--really good. That is three reallys from someone who feels so very strongly about high quality food. SO strong do I feel about this place that I unwittingly swore in earlier part of this review and decided to go back and edit out the explicative in order tone it down and keep it G rated. But I am telling you I feel that kind of passion about this place. I love their pork loin white bean special and went back for it 3 times in a week. I am a busy working mom and that level of obsession can only come with something this delectable. I loved their paella. I love their guacamole. I love their agua fresco which is not your typical fruits, they mix it up with guava for instance. Tacos, fresh tortilla chips, even the sangria has no rival. I am looking forward to my next stop here-maybe tomorrowâ€¦.]
