[114678483833995008373,100143121179594903769,I discovered Dr. Buttler a little over 2 years ago and he has turned my life around. When I met Dr. Buttler I was having problems with arthritis pain and liver issues. I was taking so many pain killers that I was killing my liver. I was also experiencing menopausal problems, night sweats, hot flashes, overweight. After he did an extensive blood panel, we found out that I was pre-diabetic as well We started a treatment plan and, almost right away, I started sleeping better, the pounds started dropping off, my pain had decreased to the point that I no longer needed drugs to make it through the day. My energy increased so much that all my friends started asking what the heck was going on. They wanted to experience what I was going through too. It's been life changing for me. To be free of pain, 60 lbs. lighter and full of energy is amazing. I highly recommend his techniques and approach. I've tried several Dr.'s but none have given me the result that he has. I have no need to go elsewhere.]
