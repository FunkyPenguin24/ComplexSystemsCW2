[102724141108174265368,100388809494861459251,I spent more than $300 at this store buying food, vitamins, face lotion, ect. The introvert of an owner has seen me in her shop at least five times. The other day I went in her shop to purchase recycled paper towel but instead accidentally grabbed toilet paper. When I went to exchange the toilet paper for paper towel I was refused because I did not have my receipt. The owner was the one that sold me my every purchase. It is obvious the owner does not care about customer service nor has she ever been personable. If you need green items or vitamins go to another shop on the mountain because this shop does not care about you. I am proof.]
