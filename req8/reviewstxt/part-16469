[117662861580324779848,101045399271069392017,One of the best restaurants in the city. The food is delicious. They have a variety of dishes that will satisfy both vegetarians and food lovers. Quality of the food is unbeatable. The service is also great (by Barcelona standards It's awsome). I recomend you to book in advance because the place is small, but if you didn;t do so and still want to try their food you can have a takeaway.]
