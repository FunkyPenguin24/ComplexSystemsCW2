[112393443827287264565,100391669254876972958,I took my daughters 2003 VW Pusat in for an emissions test. The check engine light goes on intermittently. They failed the car on this basis without actually testing the emissions and charged me $30 then tried to sell me a diagnostics package. I declined and took the car to a WA State emissions test facility and the vehicle passed. I have never once had a vehicle fail an emissions test before my experience with this company.]
