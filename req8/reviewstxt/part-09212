[103115540036832337761,100650425626337360944,I recently was shopping for my engagement ring and wedding bands. My (now) husband and I decided to go to Ben Dannie from the advice we read on Yelp and Google. The owner talked to us for nearly 20 minutes about how to rate a diamond and what kind of diamonds to look out for. We gave our budget for the ring and after my fiancee and I found the diamond we wanted, we were quoted a very fair price. When we told them we wanted some time to think about it, they actually encouraged us to shop around some more. We didn't find anything we liked nearly as much. We later went back and purchased the diamond and even had the ring custom designed based on my idea of how I wanted the setting. If you are serious about finding a quality diamond, find this great store!]
