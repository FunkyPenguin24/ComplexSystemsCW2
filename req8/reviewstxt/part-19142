[102982359930308629569,100013322815315784381,We discovered Dot's on a recent ride down RT 32S. Just as we were telling one another how hungry we were, we passed by this sweet little home/cafe with an OPEN flag flying in the breeze. We weren't really sure what to expect but we certainly weren't prepared for the warm welcome given to us by Dot and her husband. We had walked straight into an old country kitchen, complete with woodstove and cast iron pots and pans hanging on the wall. It was difficult to concentrate on ordering an actual meal when we were surrounded by all manner of homemade baked goods! My breakfast sandwich consisted of a big fluffy biscuit, sausage, cheese and an egg perfectly done, along with crispy home-fries, the kind with onions. Yum. We spent the most delightful hour or so chatting with this fabulous couple who so obviously have put their hearts and souls into the place. Since I'm Miss Curious and peppered them with questions, they were willing to share what their days are like, how they got their start; we even swapped grandparent stories! I felt like I'd just spent special time with family and even got teary when I gave Dot a big hug and said good-bye. Loaded down with blueberry muffins, donuts, and cinnamon buns, we reluctantly went on our way, but we'll be back. Oh yes, we'll be back soon!]
