[106272628804098775015,100724636791699545058,I actually go here for Tattoo Removal. I went to another place that was more expensive and was beginning to scar. The Gentlemen here at Tattoo Bills was very helpful and nice, and he did my tattoo removal very quickly and efficiently. He was knowledgeable and professional. The tattoo removal healed up much nicer than where I had been going and faded better than the other treatments. I will return here for the rest of my tattoo removal, and should I want a tattoo in the future, I will give them a try!]
