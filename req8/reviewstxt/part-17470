[111965270186943426238,101101528741059467022,Food was pretty good. But also expensive for family's on a budget. Games were 4 or more tokens each. Getting 48 tokens for $10.00 X two kids = $20.00 which gives you about 15-20 minutes of gaming. The tickets you earn don't buy you anything??? You would have to spend triple the above to keep a kid happy! My kids went home unhappy and empty handed. :( Will not return (PS I rate this place a ZERO star experience!)]
