[102009957203800723230,100030443971691932142,We switched over to Zeigler a few years ago after being dissappointed by other dealers. The service experience at Zeigler this week-end with our Jeep was once againg extremely satisfying. They have a very nice facility and definitely customer friendly. We were greeted by their service manager, Paul Dicaro who wrote up the service ticket and then followed up by other service writers such as Andy and Anthony with advice on the ststus of our repairs. Andy was particularly helpful with clear and understandable descriptions of what needed to be done and the estimated time to complete. They are a very friendly and courteous group and the work was done efficiently and professionaly and the vehicle ready on time (actually a little ahead of the forecast). We will continue to use this dealer in the future and give them an excellent rating and reccomendation!]
