[102391362203212776542,100819163292693528670,This hotel took my pillow case off my own pillow and then took 3 hours to return it. Then, after staying over 7 days here and renting two rooms, they had the nerve to charge my an extra $27 to my visa card, which would have made for a $300 a day room charge. Stay ANYWHERE else but here!]
