[103148522418170436014,100432001890545465269,I received a call from Cindy. She mentioned that she saw the resume I posted and invited me for an interview. I suspected a cattle call she said I could interview the following day at 10:30 AM or 10:45 AM. I could hear other voices in the back ground speaking the same lines and appointment times. This, to me, was a red flag. I have been to group interviews but with my unique education and experience, I expected this person to ask a few qualifying questions or at least identify to whom she is speaking. The address offers an applicant the feeling it is a legitimate business but after reading these other reviews, I'll pass.]
