[118397991185469282503,100692493439149839721,WOW!! I called ahead and told them another garage said I needed new rotors, new brake shoes, new wheel cylinders, etc...I was skeptical so I took it to Cooper in Muncie even if it is 1.5 hours away. They looked at it and told me the hand brake needed adjusted, there was air in the brake lines (I put it there so I knew that) and they adjusted the rear brakes. $35 ! WOW, they could have told me I needed all that other stuff and I would have felt like it must be true. I will always go there now!!]
