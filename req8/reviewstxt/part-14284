[100464061587058644900,100927218172236509257,I have to say the first few months were chaotic but, there was a change in company and there has been 3 changes in property manager since we moved in Feb 2012. I'd have to say things have improved greatly over the past few months with the latest manager. They have since opened a resident services building so people who live here don't have to wait eternity for the useless temps in the leasing office to help out. They also opened a business center. The Amenities have never been closed off to me as a resident and I appreciate the gym, track and fitness programs that have been implemented over the past few months. Originally I was disappointed because they sucked us into all the grandeur then, it sucked to live here but, they are finally making good on all their promises that influenced us to move in the first place. Maintenance is under new management and they have gotten better as well. Our entire building received brand new water heaters last week. The prices of apartments fluctuate wildly so, if you come in one week and the rent seems insane, try back again in 2 weeks and it will likely be reasonable. Ask about unrenovated units. There aren't many but, if they are available, they are a good price and the appliances work (at least mine do).]
