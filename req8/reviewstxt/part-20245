[104228601717111550918,100072627223191132702,Kaz is my favorite sushi restaurant in DC. I've been going there for years, and the quality is always consistently excellent. Some of my favorite special dishes include the scallop ceviche, soy braised sea bass, and the eel roll with pickled jalepenos. The classic sushi, such as the salmon, tuna, and eel nigiri, is also very good.]
