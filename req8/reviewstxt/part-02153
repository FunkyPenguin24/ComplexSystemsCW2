[100017153335886589620,100270223959051121406,Having never purchased a new car before, I was totally amazed at how easy the people (Jason Motter), made the experience. They totally respected me and my wishes and were very helpful. Jason answered all my questions those I had and those I did not think to ask! Everyone was very helpful and very friendly. I will definitely recommend Ricart, and continue to do all my business there. I love my new Juke and I am very pleased with my purchasing experience!]
