[117566468997150074650,100769203370713998062,I had an awful experience with Camelback FORD. I did have to business manager say "NO" when I asked,"Don't you believe in customer satisfaction and keeping your customers happy". Bought a BMW and they would not reset the Service check light or pay to have it turned off!! Told me it was my responsibility if I wanted if off when it had been on for 4100 miles. I had just bought the car 3 days before. Minimum legal back brakes as well and would not replace. Was upset that I took it to BMW to have it checked after I bought it!!!!! TERRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Not to mention I live 3.5 hours from the place!!]
