[105630937541991907801,101121190872503029293,Had to walk in personally to get an update after waiting a few days. Never returned my calls. They only had to install a hard drive. It was too much for them, apparently. They lied about waiving the deposit/ diagnostic fee. Very underhanded. Very unprofessional. Would have given them zero stars, but Google forced me to give them at least a one star review.]
