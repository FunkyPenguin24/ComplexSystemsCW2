[104534333667062388896,100162183656509809828,We recently bought a dish washing machine, but when we arrived at our home we realized that our kitchen is not adjusted for our new machine. We called these guys and they arrived on very next day. They installed proper hoses and taps and mounted our washing machine. All that was done for less than one hour. Few days later we discovered a small leak, when we called them they said "No problem we will arrive after half an hour" and they really did it - came to our house for second time and fixed the problematic hose for no extra charge.]
