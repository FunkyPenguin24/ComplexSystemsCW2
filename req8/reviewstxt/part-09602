[100553316886496934231,100672037612832664393,Worst hospital I ever been to. Failed to give proper service. Bill from 2008 was never received or acknowledged by hospital. I called the hospital in 2009 to make sure my account was in good standing. However a part of the bill from 2008 went into collection in 12/2013. This hospital is two blocks from my home, but I will never go there even if I'm dying.]
