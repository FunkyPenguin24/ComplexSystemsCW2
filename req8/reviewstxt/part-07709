[108316218799447458039,100571756303364119802,This was really excellent pizza. The guy who works here (I think he said his name is Emile) is a true pizza artist. The crust was thin without being crunchy (think New York style). The sauce was amazing and the ingredients were fresh. Some of the best pizza I've had in Chicago so far - and that's saying something in the land of pizza!]
