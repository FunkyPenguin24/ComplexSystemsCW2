[118371783610169100971,100311167676968988965,I was looking for some good schools for my son who is in LKG now and I heard that Carmel at Padamnabha nagar is a good school, So I decided to give a try in Carmel. I have listed my experiences with school. When I went to inquire about the admission the security staff did not allow any parent to enter in school and from the main gate itself only they asked to call the admission staff and find out which is not a good symbol at least school should have some representative to answer in correct manner. On 4th of December, finally I got the admission form and school staff informed me to come with child for interview on 9th of December and brief the fees detail, However none of the parents were allowed to see the campus. Admission Fees – 95,000 Annual Fees – 48000 (I am not adding charges detail for Books, Uniform and transport which varies ) School informs that they have extra curriculum activities like swimming but there is no swimming pool inside the school but they take childer out every week and there is extra fees to obtain this facility. Hurry!!!! Here comes the Interview day and Result. Result : Not qualified  oh! man it was a first test for my son and I was little depress that he did not do well. When teacher gave us the question paper, all my depression was gone. I am very much sure that school staff doesn’t know how to conduct a test for toddlers, It was a written test for my son and the question paper was amazing. 1. Write A to Z upper case and lower case (which is Ok , I found this is the only question which LKG student can handle) 2. Write 1 to 200 3. Match the object not with images but with word written in lower case 4. Tables up to 3 (not in paper but teacher said Its very easy paper and child should know this as well) 5. Child should be able to write 4 letters word in running writing I am not sure how many of you will agree with me that this is not a test for a LKG student, Hope the information will help.]
