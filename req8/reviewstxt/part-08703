[106581962985766452725,100623791536600553325,Very disappointed in their lack of integrity in not only their horrible people skills but also in their lousy equipment.The rented equipment broke and they were not interested in making it right. One of their workers didnt know any one was in the vehicle and just ripped this huge pressure washer that takes two people to lift, out of my vehicle by themselves which would probably also explain why they rent broken equipment. I would definitely NOT do business with them.]
