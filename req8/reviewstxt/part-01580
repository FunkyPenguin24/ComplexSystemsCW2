[114298183164374992160,100240281127974329103,My lab loves the folks at Townhouse. How do we know? She is all a-wag when we drop her off and the same when we pick her up. She loves the attention she gets during her playtime. For me, the hours are good for drop off and pick up and if you are a little late a phone call saves the day. I've never had a bad experience with this kennel.]
