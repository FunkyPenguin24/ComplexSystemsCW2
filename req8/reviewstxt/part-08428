[102994531050073036877,100610037625165902757,I'm so happy to have found the team at Parkway Wellness Center. I first found it after coming to see Ashley for a massage (which was great!) I've always had pervasive lower back problems on and off since I've done construction for over 20 years. I decided to check out the chiro here and I'm so glad I did! I've seen probably 5 different chiros over the last 15 years always with relief. But this was the first time I actually felt like we were getting to the problem. I met with Dr Joe and he talked with and did some testing, then we took xrays. Only the 2nd time I've ever gotten xrays for my chronic low back pain and I've seen quite a few doctors about it. Dr Joe sat down and showed me the xrays. I could see where the irregularities were and some arthritis I have developed. He also explained to me how we could stop the process and get me feeling better for the long term. I am very impressed with the whole process here and I'm excited to be involved in regular care to take care of my back and my health so I can work another 20 years or more if I so choose.]
