[100609627900154730002,100147097284628132482,I agree with the other reviewer, but I will not be anonymous. I had great service from MIKE. He's the only one you should work with in my opinion, the other female employees and the manager should take customer service classes. I was lied to by an employee and the manager as well. I had to pick up a quick gel mask replacement before a trip and I was charged $75. They gave me just the blue part of the 2 part gel piece, so after I returned, I had to pretty much had to fight to get the pieces I bought for $75, (On eBay btw...for under $20!). Then I found out I was overcharged for the part when I complained and they said it was $55, they just got an email about the "new prices" and the employee wasn't aware. I asked if the employee read her company emails, especially ones that pertained to her job. The manager the looked at the employee and said, "Um, we had a meeting about this" and then I was thinking "What??" and said, "So the employee just didn't care" and the manager gave me $20. Very uncool. Nightmare of a mess and with the drama, my bill is still inaccurate. Overall, I was lied to 2x, I was overcharged and got wrong equipment.]
