[110845413440278626560,100037225096084893159,My repair was for a Galaxy S4 with a cracked screen. All other functions on the phone were normal. Staff were courteous and friendly. The repair took longer than expected, and I believe was more troublesome than expected. I ended up with some discoloration at the top and bottom of my screen. The replacement glass sits a little taller on the phone than the original glass. The replacement glass was difficult to clean. I worked on it as long as I could, and then just put another screen protector over it. They discounted my repair due to the discoloration, and gave me an unlimited warranty for it. The phone works well after the repair, so overall I'm willing to live with it until my next upgrade cycle. I appreciate the discount and the additional warranty.]
