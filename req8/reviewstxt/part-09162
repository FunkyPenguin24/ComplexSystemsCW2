[113674369382760243750,100647430392749810987,I was looking for a place to rent in Sandy Hill and went for a viewing of a one bedroom at 485 King Edward with my girlfriend. The agent was quick with calling me back. The apartment was really nice, and actually looked like the photos online, unlike the first one we saw on Stewart and Friel. We ended up renting nearby because somebody rented the apartment before we made up our mind.]
