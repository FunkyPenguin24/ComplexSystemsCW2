[104407231192559274278,101142134232186759034,I don't shop anywhere else, not even online. I cannot recall one scenario that Southeast has given me a bad taste in my mouth. They've upheld service at mis-quoted (low) prices, taken returns of products that other dealers would not, maintain competitive prices, and have always had a personable staff. I would never pass up a chance to make a plug for these guys, because they deserve the business.]
