[110245623771128484352,100040123464221426536,Took someone here with complex symptoms Oct 2012. I was *amazed* how quickly we got in -- literally walked from check-in into a room, and I was encouraged to stay the entire time. Quality of care and "bedside manner" both excellent. And unlike an earlier commenter, I found that the doctor was willing to dialogue with us about what tests we didn't need to do if we wanted to save money.]
