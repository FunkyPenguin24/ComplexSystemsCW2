[102381532912616133778,100251518223413640203,New to brooklyn. We picked this place over the other patisseries in the neighborhood b/c of reviews here. First red flag was the fact that none of the workers were french. Ham & cheese croissant was basically just bread. Doughy and thick, not light and flakey as a croissant should be. A shame to france. Veggie empenada was decent at best. The filling was tasty but not nearly enough, and way to much salt on top. The baguette was covered in flour and only edible because I so badly wanted bread with my dinner that evening. I may throw it away and get one from somewhere else on the way home. Alas I will not be returning. On a side note the Kos Kaffe coffee shop across the street has amazing fresh in house roasted coffee.]
