[102936711210845454255,100688143068952892942,I highly recommend taking your vehicle to Complete Auto Pros. I am a former mechanic myself, and appreciate that I am treated with common professional respect when I take my vehicles to CAP for repairs I don't have the time to perform myself. Ron is up front and honest about all repairs and recommendations for your vehicle. The communication and customer service is top notch. Don't hesitate to take your vehicle to CAP if you're having an issue, you won't be disappointed! Ron will make you a customer for life.]
