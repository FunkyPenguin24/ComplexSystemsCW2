[102282923184697329172,100949718605812090303,Got 1,000 miles out of an Audi A8 before the main fuel pump went out. Car shut down. Would not start. Dropped it off and waited a week for a call back. I had to pay another $700 at the Audi dealer to fix it. They definitely are not mechanics. Customer service is suspect. The local Audi dealer laughed quoting, "see stuff like this all the time from them, always trying to put out a fire..." If you are inclined to purchase from them, drive straight to another dealership or import mechanic. Hook the car up to diagnosis machine and get a read out. AutoZone may even do it. My car had a cheap battery put in it, that could not handle the power requirements of the car. Again, they are not mechanics. 80% of the cars are polished terds.]
