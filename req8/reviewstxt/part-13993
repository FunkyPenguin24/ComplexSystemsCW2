[100751732949968726380,100910841332898125909,We sold our house with Marge McKenzie. I cannot express in words how happy we were. She was knowledgeable, competent, professional and great to work with. We were so extremely pleased with how quickly our home sold and the price we got for it considering the market and compared to what we had been told by other realtors who had no idea what they were talking about. But Marge priced our house right and did a wonderful job in negotiating with the realtor on the buyer's side. It was a breeze and all went so well. We can recommend Marge McKenzie very highly!!]
