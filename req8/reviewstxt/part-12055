[118297898027109765386,100804531704598062313,At first, RipTide crossfit was a great gym. My fiance and I really enjoyed going there, mainly due to the coaches. The coaches were excellent. They pushed us to our limits and made us feel included in every workout, even if it had to be modified for us! Then things started to change... they sent out a bunch of Groupons and the whole attitude of the gym changed. The owners began to value the numbers of customers instead of the value of the customers. We have put in our notice to leave RipTide Crossfit, yet we were still charged for this month. We have written 2 emails and left 3 messages and no one has responded. I would never go back to RipTide Crossfit, nor would I recommend it to anyone in Fort Lauderdale. They are the textbook description of how business should NOT be done.]
