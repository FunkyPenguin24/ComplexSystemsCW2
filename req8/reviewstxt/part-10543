[100173789226473561788,100722791016715243975,I had a nice time, but the salsa was too cold to have been served and tasted a little like refrigerator. They MUST remodel the bathroom and clean it. The restroom was very bad in every way. Ample proportions, good food, service could have been better, not expensive for what you get. Thank you.]
