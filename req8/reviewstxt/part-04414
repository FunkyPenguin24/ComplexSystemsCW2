[101615471549598955714,100393216432395026679,Asked to substitute vegetables for meat in a meat sauce. I was literally charged $7.20 more per plate. You have got to be kidding me! I gave the owner a second chance to correct any unintentional error caused by the waitress or computer. Nope. That's the way it is. Sorry guys, I went back a second time and brought a friend. But not a third time. Too bad.]
