[110226659504006426624,100781374018029736991,i have stayed at the spring hill before a couple of times and have had great customer service rooms are decent and love the free breakfast in the morning and the rate is fair so that's why i went back this labor weekend, but this time it was different when i arrived the front desk was nice, booked my 2 rooms and started to get ready for the concert when we came back we parked or vehicles right in front of the front desk in plain eye sight of the front desk, well lit area so we trusted nothing would happen to our vehicles but to our surprise when we woke up in the morning they had stolen one of our trucks and the front desk clerk was just seating in the front lobby watching TV and drinking coffee! we made the police report and the manager (general manager) David just pretty much said sorry we aren't liable nobody saw anything we don't have cameras outside. he told me you guys can stay a little longer because we needed to go rent a vehicle since we had 5 adults 4 kids and a newborn and only 1 truck now and it was almost check out time. he told us we could have complimentary drinks and snacks (i guess that was his way of making it up to us for having our truck stolen right in front of the front desk basically) when our husbands came back with the rented car we were still in shock about the situation and really hadn't eaten and still hadn't packed and the GM David told one of the kids, "i know your situation but when are ya'll checking out? tell your parents to call me" when i went to the front desk he was gone and a new guy was there i told him are keys weren't working so he reset them i asked him, are we going to be charged for staying over 12pm? he wasn't aware of our situation, i told him what happened then he said, "no don't worry about it, i understand" so i told him okay we are gonna eat then get our stuff ready and will be out and that's exactly what we did well not even an 1 hr later we get a call from the front desk asking when are we checking out anybody who has kids knows its not easy feeding kids and packing everything in less than an hr but we did our best and got out of the hotel. Its sad that this happened to us and we still felt rushed out by the hotel because we went over the check out time i thought they would have handled it better but never going back to that hotel. i would highly recommend you don't either not just because of the service but because that area is not safe the police said there was a high crime rate in that area with cars getting broken into and stolen at hotels we found that out a little too late.]
