[103429988269289272340,100224277741944188330,Excellent food - great service - my wife and I go there often for what she claims is the best coffee on the coast (I'm not a coffee freak). Used to go most mornings for breakfast, but now she is working in Brisbane she insists we go both days of the weekend without fail. Try their club sandwich for lunch. Great.]
