[103841774654692246292,100016546869867345420,I have been to The Fort' several times. The people were friendly and helpful every time. I have gotten some great deals on hats there and they are very good at shaping and sizing hats for you on the spot. I have never had a problem with rudeness though I am well mannered myself I usually get that in return. Great store and massive selection of western wear!]
