As the name suggests, they do brats, burgers, fries, cheese curds, and not a whole lot else. But they make what they make, and have a condiment bar if you choose to go to town. The reason the seating area is so important is two-fold. One, instead of ordinary tables in the center, they have island bars. These are great for sitting and conversing, but if you have a larger crowd, it is not awkward to stand next to. With all the TVs on the wall, it's a great game day place. But even on Friday or Saturday nights, the dance floor and main alcohol bar are on the second floor, so you can go up there and party if you want, but you can stay on the first floor and drink casually if that is your thing (it is mine).]
