[110196560479451040561,100998240563660572007,This is the type of place I want to go to when I eat out. After you order at the counter, much like in a fast-food restaurant, you go sit down till they call your name to get your food. No wait-people, no escort to a table, just you and who you bring along. The food is great! I love the Combo nachos with queso, always comes out with more than enough to feed two people, of which it does with my wife there with me. They have so many menu choices, you maybe hard pressed to find one to decide on. You can easily have a nice tex-mex dinner for 2 under $10 here and never feel pressed to buy more.]
