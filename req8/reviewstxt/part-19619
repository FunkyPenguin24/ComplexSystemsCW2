[106212784886429255088,100039524429246044714,I bought a new 2012 Mercedes 350 there last year. The salesman was a good guy but the sales manager is very conceited. I have seen him many times over the years and always the same. Problem is that after the sale you have to deal with their service department. They just don't seem to try to give you a feeling of having come into a relationship with a high priced car dealer, after having spent that kind of money to buy their car and then pay lots for their service. I have started getting services at Skyland Mercedes in Asheville since I stay in Asheville a lot. Service department is very friendly and accommodating.]
