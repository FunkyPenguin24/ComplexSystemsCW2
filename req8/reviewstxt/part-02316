[110846516544287908481,100278491657251086861,I just ordered a breakfast bowl from this place and it was gross. I ordered a hash brown,egg, cheese and sausage bowl. It was so saggy and it tasted like i was just eating potatoes. I wish i could up load a picture of the i/2 inch of grease on the bottom. i only ate 1/3 of it then i went to McDonald s to get the taste out of my mouth. I will never order this again. For the most part there food is good. I was just craving a good breakfast bowl and it left me with a bad taste in my mouth....But for the most partfood and service just a bad experience..
