[109337451563185458966,100824131659448900421,The atmosphere was great, some food was awesome (chicken flautas) and some was a bit less accomplished. Bit pricey for small portions but fitting for Sedona, but the true killer was the service. We had a huge wedding party of 25 and as it was split, one server did his job as well as the others partly and was great, unfortunately my server was absent, unhelpful, and a little rude. As a server I wanted to confront her but as this was a friends reception I let the $1.50 tip do the talking. It has great potential, I hope the owners look into it but I won't go back or suggest it.]
