[108782865491649100076,100627190992174758320,My husband and I are always looking for somewhere that offers healthy options in a fast service, low key atmosphere. Unfortunately this is not an easy task, even in large cities. So when I saw the name of this place “Designer Greens” I thought this had to be a place we would enjoy. The website drew us in with the first sentence that states that it is the place for an ultimate salad and sandwich experience that uses only the freshest ingredients. We went on a Sunday afternoon with our son. The restaurant was empty, which made me question what it was going to taste like. We were abit confused about the menu and how to order. I think had the employees assisted us better or explained the way the menu was set up then we would have ordered something different. Nevertheless, e both enjoyed our salads and will go back one day. I do think that there should be more options for the salad and a better way of seeing all the options when designing your own salad. But the portion size was large for the price. There were no drinks for children (no milk or juice just soda or tea) despite having a kids menu, which I found very odd. We will return because it was exactly as we hoped: a quick service, nearby restaurant that offers healthy custom salads and sandwiches. I only wish the employees were more friendly and helpful. Check out the menu!]
