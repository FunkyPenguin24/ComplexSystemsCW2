[104719180979338922026,100252110157760337576,I have taken 2 of my dogs to this wonderful vet to have surgery. The first was to remove a lump on the shoulder of my adult male pit bull. The pricing was very reasonable and the level of professionalism of the staff is what led me to taking in our other Pit to be fixed and have a tooth removed. Both experiences were delightful and I am glad to say that I have found a NEW local Pup Doc! Thanks Gentle Vet our Dogs LOVE YOU!!!!]
