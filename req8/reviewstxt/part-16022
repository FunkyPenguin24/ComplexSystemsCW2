[111170297796172666854,101021837284969088236,I took my wife here for dinner on a date because I heard good things about this place. However, I did no expect the level of service to be so "casual". It is deli style ordering with sit down prices. The food was good, fresh, and tasty, but the service was very lacking for the price. I was expecting a nice little sit down, take your order and the table type service, but I got fastfood style instead.]
