[100360746228155511595,101089940540309193839,I was laid off at my construction job, and lost my only means of transportation - the company vehicle. I contacted this dealership, told them about my emergency, and they not only had a great deal for me but they FLEW ME TO THEIR DEALERSHIP FOR FREE. If that's not customer service I don't know what is. I was at an extremely rough point in my own life and they took it upon themselves to assist in every way possible. They were incredibly friendly and forthright, and I'd highly recommend them in the future.]
