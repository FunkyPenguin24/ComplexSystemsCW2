[106588049823925363940,101002760536858333289,I will never forget my stay in Roma, and Hotel Isa. The service is really good; rooms are beautiful, clean, and modern. The old world charm of the dark wood, and the elevator lift were stunning. The star attraction is the beautiful rooftop, and views. To come back to the hotel and go up there at night for relaxation and coffee/wine was the highlight of this hotel. The breakfast is excellent and the hotel is very well located. Close to the Vatican and also close to the main attractions. All hotel staff from the front desk, rooftop, and maid service was excellent! For my next (and hopefully soon) visit to Roma, I will certainly stay at this hotel and will recommend it to others. I love beautiful and chaotic Roma. Thank you for a wonderful experience.]
