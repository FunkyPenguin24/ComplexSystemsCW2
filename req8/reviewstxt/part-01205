[105344224061595494044,100221686607626696969,I stayed for a night there during Sep '13. It was a rainy afternoon and I was stuck there. The hotel room was clean and good. But the problem was with their outdated (they call it "vintage") elevator. After settling into my room, I went down to the basement restaurant on that rainy evening. It was full but the lady there found a table for me. I enjoyed my Lamb burger and Petrous.]
