[105686893548668090147,101046926100049187701,Do not take your car to this place. You will end up paying for repairs you don't need, if they actually make the repair. The manager is in the business of ripping people off, not being honest. $7200 for repairs that aren't needed is beyond disgraceful. They lie, bully their mechanics into doing the jobs for fear of losing theirs, get yelled at and fired if they do not cooperate with the mangers scheme. If they put an oil sticker on your car, that doesn't mean the oil actually got changed. And if you notice in the other reviews, two of the reviews are the same under different names. They have wives and girlfriends write fake reviews. Also notice the other reviews are poor-fair. Hmm. BBB will be contacted.]
