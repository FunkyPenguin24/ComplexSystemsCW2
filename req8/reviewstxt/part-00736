[100563058627413364809,100197783556799293123,The owners and managers of Hoover Tactical Firearms have taken notice of your thoughts and words and have taken them as constructive criticism. If you feel that you are having issues ask to speak with a member of our management team. We want to know when you feel mistreated as well as when you have received the service you expect. We are close to the end of one of the worst retail events in the history of our industry. We have worked to better train our employees and are now offering more services than ever. The newest is the public opportunity to shoot the live fire PRISM video scenarios. Our Cerekote firearm painting program has grown leaps and bounds. Ask to see examples when in the store. We hope to have more information available on our website soon. Our inventory is gradually growing but we are still having the same issues that almost every firearms retailer is having in our country. Inventory has not been able to match that of demand. We feel that we have kept our word that we will, and have not, increased our prices due to the vast demand. We hope our customers will remember that when inventory is back to pre December, 2012 levels. We wish we could take special orders and expect to have them filled but our wholesalers cannot currently provide that service within expectations. The firearms classes and shooting range are available seven days per week. Come enjoy some time shooting holes in our targets as well as the PRISM simulator. We know there are many opportunities for you when choosing where to spend your hard earned income. Give us the opportunity to show you what we hope, and many others enjoy, to be a favorite stop when choosing what to do.]
