[100397999516288376129,100382470624374213930,Continually have a good experience. I never have to wait more than a few minutes even when I show up 10 minutes early. Dr. V. is very respectful and clearly cares about his patients' health, not just running them through the system. Receptionists/nurse staff are very polite, nice, and easy to work with.]
