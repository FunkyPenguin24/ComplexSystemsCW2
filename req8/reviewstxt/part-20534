[113863002202060271923,100087574300161246019,Let me first say that I am a fan of Jimmy Johns. I enjoy there subs and have always enjoyed there food, but I've been into this Round Rock store twice now, and both times the bread was HARD, HARD, and the staff there were rude. I would stay away from this store if you know what's good for you!!!! Joyce]
