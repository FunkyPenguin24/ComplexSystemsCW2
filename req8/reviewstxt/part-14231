[116380387138384532309,100924345782103559577,The most arrogant servers I have met. Table of eight. Seven people received their food in 20+- min. OK. I had to ask about the last person. Waiter told me I should "chill out". Asked for manager. He said that the waiter told him I was unreasonable. Will never eat there again. We all know the food is mediocre at best....just wanted to have the coast experience.]
