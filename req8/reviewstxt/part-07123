[108430404628297726663,100538891996445237231,I'm willing to give them a second chance because of all of the good reviews, but I was not impressed. I'm pretty sure the gyoza came frozen in a bag, but the server was not able to tell me one way or the other. My entree, the "drunken noodle" did not look very appetizing at all. The actual flavor wasn't bad, but it tasted like the noodles were not seasoned. In truth, it was better the day after. I spent 21 bucks and wasn't especially impressed. Like I said, I'll likely give them another shot, but my first impression was not a good one.]
