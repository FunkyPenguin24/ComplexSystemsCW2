[117509820193088816727,100076781697871055511,I wish there was a way to do a half star as I would give Todd 4.5 stars. I googled Mac tech support and up popped his name. I called him, he came over got lots of info from me - many of my passwords - and off he went with ALL my equipment, iMac, keyboard, mouse, external hard drive and my iPad!! I said to myself - "I sure hope your intuition is correct that this is a trustworthy person, cuz otherwise he just made off with everything!" Well, my intuition certainly was correct. Not only did he do EVERYTHING he said he would do, in the amount of time he said it would take, but he brought it all back, set it up and I noticed he had even CLEANED my dirty keyboard!! Something I had been meaning to do for a while. Those little touches speak loudly. He then spent 2 hours with me - educating, me about the best ways to use my devices, and get the most out of the amazing way they all communicate with one another. Being someone who also works with people and loves my work what I appreciated most of all was how clearly he LOVES his work and his passion for all things APPLE is clear. The only thing that kept me from the full 5 stars is that I wish that his hourly rate were not as high as it is... however, I do feel that his knowledge and experience is something I will continue to regularly use. Thanks Todd!]
