[108107460559327398219,100945545186732807288,I just purchased a new Pathfinder Platinum and have nothing but raves for this dealership and their staff. I did so via the Internet and the process was flawless. I had my transaction completed in a 30 minute period with Josh Henderson, Internet Director, who was an absolute delight. He was concise, efficient, clear-cut, courteous, extremely considerate, polite and most importantly, trustworthy. We were greeted by the manager, Paul Francis, personally and treated with courtesy, respect, consideration and encouragement. He genuinely appreciated our business and expressed it throughout our experience. My vehicle was readied to meet all of my expectations and our salesman, Doug McIntosh, spent a great deal of time making us familiar with the car's features. The price for my vehicle was most competitive and I recommend this dealership without reservation. The car is a joy to drive and the attention to detail, along with some great options, make it a must have!]
