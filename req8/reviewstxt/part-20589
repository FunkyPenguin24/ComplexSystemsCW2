[109495510317168188007,100090567949179613234,I've leased 3 cars from Sterling Honda, in 2008. 2012, and 2013. In both 2012 and 2013, Parry Lively helped me - both times, he was wonderful, but in 2013, he was a godsend. I was rear-ended last month on the Gardiner, totaling my 2012 Civic (that car saved my life). I called Parry a few days later, and he was extraordinarily helpful in getting me back into a car. Here are just a few of the many things Parry did for me: he picked me up at home and drove me to Sterling on two occasions; he explained in detail all of the upgrades from the 2012 to 2013 model, including the (now very important to me!) safety upgrades; he worked hard to get me what I believe is an excellent deal on the new car; he expedited matters by speaking with my insurance company and getting my car released to me as quickly as possible; and he has offered continued help with any questions I have about the car and its systems. In short, Parry was kind, helpful, and did more than anyone could have expected to transition me to my new car. I absolutely recommend Sterling Honda (which has been good to me over the past 5 years), and Parry in particular, if you're on the market for a Honda.]
