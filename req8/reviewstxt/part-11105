[102118329305127789097,100753492938478939203,Shame on you Field of Flowers! Last week we ordered a corsage of small white orchids with rhinestones for Prom, today. Two hours before pick up I was called and told they ran out of the small orchids but could provide a corsage in purple, green, or 4 inch orchids! When I rejected that, they said they could do a white spray of roses. I grudgingly accepted. They then called back and said they only had full size roses! I canceled the order with 1 1/2 hours left to go! I called De La Flor Flowers in Cooper City. They had the correct size orchids and we will have our corsage in time. Thank goodness for De La Flor saving the day! We spent a lot of money with Field of Flowers (they are expensive!), but that has come to a screeching halt. Again, Shame on you for not delivering on your promise.]
