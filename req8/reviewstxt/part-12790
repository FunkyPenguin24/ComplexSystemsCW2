[112876822647242018158,100845092901933362082,Wow- we have been in our new home for a month now and are extremely happy that we chose Danny to help us through this process. He stuck by us over the last year as we slowly narrowed our search toward the perfect house. We felt as though we were dragging Danny around the metro with the many (30? 50? I lost count!) homes we wished to see throughout our search, but he was always positive and made us feel like we were his only clients at the time. Danny went (as others have said) above and beyond our expectations. If he couldn't answer our phone call he would check back with us almost immediately. He listened to our concerns and worked hard to get the various offers we made ready within hours. We will without a doubt be checking back with Danny for future real estate business.]
