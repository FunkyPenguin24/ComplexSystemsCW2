[117712952793579477185,100771690677836210543,I have used Colgrove for my two breast augmentation surgeries and have been happy with both surgeries. One of saline implants leaked 6.5 years after the initial surgery. I went back and upgraded two months ago to silicone, I should have done that in the first place! I highly recommend silicone over saline. Not fun to go to bed with a nice, full breast and to wake with a flat one! Especially if you dont have 3-5 k in the bank to fix it. Thankfully mine were still under warranty but I did not want to risk having that experience again. Since I only have experience with Colgrove, I cannot compare him to other doctors in this field but he does have the best price in town. I agree with some comments about his lack of bedside manner, friendliness etc but I disagree with the comment that you "get what you pay for." He does great work from what I have seen and my personal experience. I really dont care as much about my doctor being nice as I do about him being excellent at what he does and in my opinion he is. His staff IS nice to include the nurses and his anesthesiologist which are the people you deal with most anyway.]
