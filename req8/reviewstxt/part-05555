[109452734559846106393,100453844311752436974,Bill was very easy to work with. He has a customer-centric, no-pressure technique that makes buying a new vehicle a pleasant experience. When we are ready to buy my wife's jeep, he's our guy. The dealership had great incentives and financing options to make buying a new Ram affordable. Brandon did a wonderful job explaining our financing options and really worked with us to make getting an extended warranty worth our while. Overall, we found the dealership easy to get to, had a friendly and professional staff, a good selection of vehicles, a clean and inviting showroom and great service after the sale features. Sincerely, Charles and Lauri Weber]
