[100934796846950131008,100887276783127414283,My mother and I went in on a Saturday for mani/pedis. I called that morning and was able to get appointments for us both. Although they were busy when we arrived at our appointed time, we did not have to wait. We each got a great pedicure, my mom got a manicure and I got a full set of acrylic nails. The place was clean and comfortable. We were each offered a cold beverage and treated very well. The staff was very pleasant and communicated with each other and clients in English, rather than speaking to other people while working on your nails in a language you cannot understand (which is just rude.) My only complaint is that although my nails seemed well done, they turned out a bit thick and wide for my liking. I filed them a bit at home and reapplied a top coat and they looked great. Overall the staff and atmosphere is great and the prices are reasonable. Just be specific as to exactly how you want your nails shaped. All in all, I will return and I highly recommend this salon.]
