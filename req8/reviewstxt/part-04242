[110578870131299239343,100383983908378525869,Our dog Zoe had injured her leg. She was favoring it, but we didn't see an instance that would cause her to start favoring her leg. Called one 24 hour place near us and they were not helpful at all. Clearly just interested in having us come in and give them money. Called Animal Specialty Group and Suzanne was extremely helpful. She talked us through all the possible scenarios when we gave her the symptoms. She was very forthright and helped out a lot. I understand that there is a liability issue and no one wants to make a diagnosis over the phone because the only way to be 100% sure is by bringing the dog in. But unlike TLC Pet Medical on Santa Monica, this place would at least talk to you on the phone about the issue and discuss your options. Their obvious care for the pet and the pet owner would make me drive the extra distance to visit their clinic over the one only a mile away.]
