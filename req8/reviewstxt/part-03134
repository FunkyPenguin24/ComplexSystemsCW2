[107310829255766911210,100321332315373242059,East park is an asset to the city that is a great place to gather and meet for so many functions, such as the band festival and for so many family/friend gatherings I have been a part of over my nearly 55 years in Mason City! I've witnessed first hand, on my many walks in our cities parks and they are so well maintain, our parks in town look great! Thank you Parks and Rec department for a great job!]
