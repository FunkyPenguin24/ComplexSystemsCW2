Asked for a float and the gentleman working the counter could have cared less about what I was asking for. I was given a poorly made slush instead with most of the flavoring in the bottom. My girl friend did receive what she ordered. Upon paying, the manager could clearly tell I was not happy and did nothing. It was easy to see the employees could have cared less. I will go elsewhere from now on. Most likely the place on the main street in Allendale.]
