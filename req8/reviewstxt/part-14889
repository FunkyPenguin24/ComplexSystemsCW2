[101995592138929098423,100961378287949589198,I have been coming to this nail salon for probably 8 years or more. I have always had great pink and white nails done as well as pedicures. My pink and white nails will last me about 3-4 weeks as opposed to just 2 before having to do fills. Ask for what you want and you'll get it. As one of the nail techs told me here, you're paying for it so you should get what you want. I've never had any complaints about the service. And pricing is more than fair.]
