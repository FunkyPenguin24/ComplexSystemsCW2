[105836204804153224316,100025377454043012398,10 star in my opinion. You have to pay big bucks to be treated like an old friend. The staff in the hall always smiles and speaks. Just an incredible place, breakfast free actually worth eating. Most free breakfasts in hotels under $200 are just not good. We usually go out to eat, not in Lawrenceville, GA. Since finding the Country Inn, we just don't think of staying on some other hotels in the community. We have stayed in 3 others and I will assure you that they do not meet C Inn standards. NOW, the real test, as you know all mid-range and lower-end hotels have an individual air-conditioner which bangs and blows super cold or nothing or ????. Not the new units in Country Inn. I hate to stay in hotels that have these air cond., but CI has installed new that don't have you up and down every hour or so. I was in St. Thomas Marriott several years ago and the unit was so bad, I finally called and had them change the unit. It has never failed in the past. I made this comment sometime back after a stay in Country Inn and when we arrived this past week the new units had been installed. This is not the Four Seasons, but I cannot find a hotel under $250 that I think is better than Lawrenceville, GA Country Inn and Suites. You have to go to a Four Seasons to find people this well trained. Thanks Lawrenceville Country Inn for making our stay pleasant and safe. Delano Hill Mount Olive, NC]
