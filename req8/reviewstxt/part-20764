[117165751419039848640,100100035751802430863,I trained at Mushin from spring of 2008 until December of 2013. In that time and since my move out of state, I have had the opportunity to train with others around the world and nowhere else has even approached the atmosphere of professionalism, knowledge and family that I found inside those walls. More than just a place to learn to punch, kick, throw and submit, Mushin instills a sense of history, purpose and camaraderie that few other gyms could ever hope to achieve.]
