[106778326973340861942,101163727596660013072,I was approached by a door salesman and scheduled a simple estimate. When they notified me the morning of the estimate I was told my spouse had to be present in order to give me an estimate. I was very disappointed and cancelled the estimate. Advised the Sales Manager that I can make decisions and there was not a need for my wife to be present, but he refused to give me a estimate. Very poor customer service....another high pressure sales pitch I assume.]
