[105960817795055392809,100018113285732356967,CONS: SLOW service, soggy quiche, no eggs till 8. PROS: Nice decor. Our first trip a few months ago was disappointing, but we decided to give it another try today. Last time we came around 10 am and it was a zoo, so when our basic food took 45-60 minutes we let it go. Today we arrived about 7:25 am and there were only a few tables occupied. We ordered and paid, about about 5 minutes later were apologized to, and told that they forgot to tell us but they "don't do eggs until 8 am"? Really? Too much trouble for the cook to get in before then? They open at 6:30 mind you. Not wanting to wait 30 minutes, we changed our order to a quiche and a bagel sandwich along with a bagel for our toddler. We asked for a rush on the toddler's bagel if possible. About 25 minutes later (after the reorder) we got all of our food. Quiche was barely warm and bottom crust was near non existent and soggy. Another annoyance is the use of the iPad swipe app where they flip the iPad over back to you and you can select a tip - starting at 15% and going up from there. This is at the counter mind you, not table service. Oh, sure, you deserve $4.50 to take my order at the counter. Sorry, no. We really want this place to work as it's adorable, and much of the food looks great. We were excited that they are one of the few places in town that open early (toddler remember), but since the grill doesn't come on till 8 who cares? We'll not soon be back. Maybe the third time is the charm?]
