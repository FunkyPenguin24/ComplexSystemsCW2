[113383772054407538813,100362589481976606641,My wife and I were looking for a used Honda Pilot that was in good condition and reasonably priced. We found many listings in the Boston area but ultimately focused in on one at Honda Village in Newton. We are fortunate to have done so. Honda Village is an excellent choice in local car dealers. The facilities are nice, the staff is friendly and attentive, and there are plenty of distractions for kids while you work out a deal for a car. The vehicle we bought is a gem, and we had the opportunity to work with a great guy - Jim Samson. Jim is knowledgeable, very responsive, honest, and fair. We found Jim to be willing to go the extra mile in negotiating, and he called us back quickly and answered questions even during off hours. An even larger show of his commitment was when he came in to meet us on his day off and delayed his trip to the Topsfield Fair with his fiance for us. It was a sacrifice for him to do so, and we hope she forgave him! All humor aside, we could not be happier with the product we bought in terms of pricing, quality and service, as well as the people we worked with in our relationship with Honda Village in Newton. While, I am glad to be done with the car hunt, I would enjoy working with Jim and his associates at Honda Village again when the time comes. As I said, the Pilot is a gem, and Jim, well he is a gem, too. He really took good care of us and I urge any reader of this review to look him up and give him the opportunity to help you in your car search as he did with us. Best of luck!]
