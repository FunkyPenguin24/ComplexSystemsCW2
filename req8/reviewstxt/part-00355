[111227719002249238103,100177731163827017485,I've been to this place at least 5 times both for my car and for my daughters car, and she is very bad with taking care of her vehicle..... Alan is very good at explaining what is wrong and what needs to be done, and if you can't afford everything like in my daughters case, he'll tell you what can wait. I don't know what was wrong with the guy who gave this place a bad review, maybe it was him.]
