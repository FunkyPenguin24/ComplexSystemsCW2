[100390722735874290302,100044966859823940023,Ordered tacos, burrito and some other dishes around the table. All the food was good and plenty of it for the price. I ordered a burrito as it's $3, and I couldn't believe a burrito could only be $3. It was decent size and tasty, however it's just a meat burrito, no rice, beans any of that jazz. The service was very nice, it took a while to get the food, but nothing too long. The place is inside what seems to be a home that was made into a restaurant. It's not dirty but it's not what you would call clean. Some of the ceiling tiles are water stained, the tables are a dingy green. Nothing sticky on the tables or visible dirt anywhere in the place, but doesn't give the feeling of clean. They offer lunch specials for $7 which are good size and price. At the end of the meal you get sopapillas for the table and your honey sauce. Very tasty and there was no charge for them so that's a big plus! I would visit again as the food was good, staff VERY friendly, and the sopapilla are free and great! Been to a few Mexican restaurants and none offer sopapilla for just eating there.]
