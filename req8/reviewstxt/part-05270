[100101471283580604329,100439188624386773145,I ordered the papaya salad (4 star spicy), laap gai, pho, my little girl ordered the pad thai noodles (a bit on the sweet side), my son also ordered pho, & my husband ordered the pad phrik (3 star medium spice). Let me tell you...the food was better than my mom's home cooking!! And that says ALOT (I'm from a Laotion family). I've eaten from other Thai restaurants in the Tri-Cites...BUT none compares to this one!! You guys ROCK!!! การแสดงความขอบคุณ = Thank You]
