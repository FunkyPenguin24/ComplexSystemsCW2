[116069413227160986206,100784424498657833356,my company has been in business for 10 years when I interviewed Paperstreet along with 3 other web design companies..right from the start I knew Paperstreet was a different caliber of web design company compared to what we had in the past. From the initial sales and proposal process, design and, also set up. Nothing but professional from step one all the way to the launch. We continue to use their services for SEO work and we are making good climbs in the search engine rankings.. We continue to work closely with Paperstreet to make sure we our company website evolves as the market evolves. after the launch of our site Paperstreet submitted our site to IMA and the Aliant payments website won best in class for business to business web sites. that pretty much says it all.
