[106710571825216712596,100984932331359594255,Well, I'm devoted to keeping business flowing to our local firms. But, Marks' tryed to hose me after buying a gun, ammunition,and a holster here. The holster was a rip off. Afterwards at home, I surfed the holster manufacturer's site and found, much to my amazement, that I had pad TWICE the recommended mfg's retail price. TWICE! (And compared to web prices it was THREE TIMES higher.) So help me out. How would you describe and react to this news? Were they just charging what the market would bear? Had they added value well beyond the MSRP by, say, having lots of alternative holsters displayed? I think -- none of the above. I think they were taking advantage of an ignorant buyer or one that they sensed didn't care about prices. I may continue to shop there, but I will be checking internet prices while I'm in the store. They lost the chance to conduct reasonable commerce there.]
