[100901125979529607927,100565085614696809160,Fantastic food, fantastic service and the nicest people! We took almost 30 people there between X-mas and New Years. We had the best time and the food just kept coming and coming. My glass never went empty and the bill was better than I expected. I would highly recommend Coppa 82 when you want great food great price and a relaxed family atmosphere. Dan and Ann Marie DiTomaso]
