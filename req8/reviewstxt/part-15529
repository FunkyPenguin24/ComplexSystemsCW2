[109430351571352965755,100995593587764452108,I had my wedding reception at Rincon Beach Club in July 2011. The venue is ideal. It's right near the beach, has an elegant room inside if the weather outside is prohibitive AND has a beautiful patio. Melissa and Jamie were extremely helpful to me. Melissa, in particular, has years of experience with Rincon and helping brides and grooms make decisions about what will make their wedding just how they want it to be. She also had great suggestions for other vendors. My reception was everything I wanted it to be. All of my centerpieces, place cards, and favors were laid out on the tables as I had requested. My cake was displayed on the wooden patio. Guests raved about the food and the service. There are many beautiful spots to take photos and plenty of room for guests to enjoy food and dance indoors or outside. I highly recommend the Rincon!]
