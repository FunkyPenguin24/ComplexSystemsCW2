[106149847625966574039,100434778467034912916,I just want to add my comment to others in an effort to help someone making a choice of plumbing Companies. This is our experience only, and it may differ from others. We had a minor leak under the sink in our master bath. I attempted to repair the leak, and I was not successful. Rather than continue trouble shooting my wife refered to the yellow pages. They do run a nice ad. The service many came out, very polite, and said he would work on the "peeTrap" under the sink for "$286. That had been the first thing I tried and felt it was not the problem.. BUT $286... WOW that was nuts for a peetrap, and very doubtful that was the problem, as the service man said it would be more if the peetrap was not the problem. We sent him on his way, and he wanted $69.00 for a trip charge to tell us "NOTHING". We called another plumber "Reeves Family Plumbing". They were out the next morning at 7:30 sharp. It was NOT the peetrap. The line was stopped up due to the air conditioning drainage and they ran a rooter through the line cleaned it out. Checked for other leakage, and a charge of $128.00. It is my thought that the Hutinson guy would have said the obvious the peetrap was not the problem and charge us another overpriced fee. Like someone else probaly in the $500 range while they tried different causes.]
