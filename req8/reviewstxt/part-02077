[107395407062120728947,100266510606422703832,I have only dealt with Magnum Collision Repair Center once and I will go no where else from this point on. The moment I walked into the door I was treated with excellent customer service and the all mighty updated communication. I was kept informed on a weekly basis as their craftsmen repaired our BMW. They treated me as I would have wanted. Their work is second to none. Body work and painting is perfect. Under the hood is perfect. Price is competitive. Much like great food or great wine you get what you pay for. Magnum is where to go for any and all your automobile body repairs regardless of how major or minor the requirement is. Our contact was James and he was great. Thank you]
