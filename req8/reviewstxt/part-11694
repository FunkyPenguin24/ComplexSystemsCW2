[108261397618303559032,100785094946814978462,People have been telling me to check this place out for a while. Unfortunately, coming from Silver Spring just to check out the latest in Dupont seems like more trouble than it's worth sometimes, but I was in Dupont this morning for other reasons and remembered it for lunch. I ordered the chicken satay over cold noodles with the red curry, broccoli, papaya slaw, and peanuts. Needless to say, it was truly spicy, but I love spicy foods and found myself putting a touch of Sriracha sauce on anyways. The cold noodles really helped to balance out the tastes, and every ingredient tasted fresh and well-prepared. The amount of textures and tastes you can cram into a bowl for seven bucks makes this place pretty hard to beat. For those questioning the authenticity of the food, they make a point to say that their food is inspired by, not actually, southeast Asian. And, as someone coming from the Vietnamese and Thai food mecca of Silver Spring/Wheaton, I'd say this is a pretty great tribute to those cuisines. I'll be back many times when I'm in the area, for sure.]
