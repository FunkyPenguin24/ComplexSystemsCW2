The servers here were all over the place. On the patio one minute, in the dining room the next, constantly flying past each other and flying past our table. If they had sections like most places I think it would have been a much better experience. We spent most of our time there waiting, and waiting, and waiting... Buuut the food was indeed tasty.]
