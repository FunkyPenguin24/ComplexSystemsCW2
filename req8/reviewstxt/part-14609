[108002041417113012412,100945558782720324036,I read all of the bad reviews on here but they were the only store in town that carried a designer that I was looking for so I tried them anyways. I had a VERY positive experience, the girls helping me were all very helpful and sweet. I found my dress here and I got a GREAT deal on it. I highly recommend Suburban Bridals, it took 3 different trips to Suburban for me to make my decision and I had a positive experience every time.]
