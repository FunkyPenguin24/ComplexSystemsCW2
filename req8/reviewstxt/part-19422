[113801842241414528641,100028904970223540156,Amazingly, there is still a doctor who sees patients at the time of their appointment! Dr Tanen has been my Endocrinologist for several years now - and he was a blessed relief from the old one who was consistently late, had the bedside manner of a charging rhino and dictated notes during his time with me. Dr. Tanen, in contrast, is calm and methodical. He appears to hear what I say to him and responds appropriately. He calls me personally with my lab results a few days after they are drawn - even on weekends - and he is willing to prescribe Armour Thyroid which I find necessary. The office is clean. The staff are nice but busy, and they draw labs in house. He has been a godsend to me, and I will continue to drive 40 minutes to see him as long as he will keep letting me in the door.]
