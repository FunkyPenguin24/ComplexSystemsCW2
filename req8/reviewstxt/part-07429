[102585043540196366589,100556288335606929294,SKIP THIS COURSE on your next golf outing. Arrived 45 minutes early for our tee time to a understaffed course. Then were treated to the most rude starter I've ever came across. Followed that up by a 3 hour, 45 minute FRONT NINE! We were then accused of being the 3 groups slowing up play even though we waited 15 minutes on each shot. Told the ranger we were quitting and he said, "good". Completely rude & unprofessional staff. Other than that, Jackie Jr. put a nice course out there that I am sure won't be around very much longer if they keep up their policies of rude and incompetent staff.]
