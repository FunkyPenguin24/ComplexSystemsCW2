[104258678843109115338,101171021103387025050,I just relocated to the area adjacent Harvey's and happened upon the bar on a Saturday afternoon ride. I am so glad I stopped in. It is a true bar, no frills, great prices on beverages, has an established group of regulars, and Wendy the bartender was nothing but a pleasure. The sitting area in the back is perfect for smokers who like to sit and sip a drink, socialize, and have a puff or two. The decor is classic bar. Feels like it is supposed to. I knew I found my new home when I pulled the harley up next to two other bikes. I went back Sunday afternoon and parked next to yet another harley. Thanks Harvey's. You have made the stress of moving to a new area one step better.]
