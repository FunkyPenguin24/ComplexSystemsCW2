They had forgotten to put it in. After waiting another half hour we finally got our pizzas. when we got home and started eating we realized how bad it was. The crust tasted sour. The sauce tasted like Campbell's tomato soup. The cheese tasted like the sole of a tennis shoe. We just threw it away and went to Denny's. Save your money go to anyplace else. Even Totino's frozen pizza is better than pronto pizza.]
