[110193161156830887213,100901085086106139846,I fractured my foot (as determined by urgent care facility). When insurance told me that I needed a referral from my primary care before I could see an orthopedic I called and asked for a referral. I was told that they would not write a referral without seeing me first. I asked to speak to him and they refused to let me speak to him on the phone. When I asked to speak to the office manager she told me that it was no big deal that my foot was fractured. I am disgusted with the service that this facility provides and will be contacting my insurance company to change my primary care as soon as possible.]
