[102048400738096000261,100796627311110906490,Alex Jeffries and his staff at the Christy Sports were the best folks I have dealt with at any ski rental place I ever visited in past 10 yrs from France to US. The Ptarmigan Inn location and the ski storage is like a personal valet service, very convenient too. The ski in level is one above the store and as soon as you are either ready to get on the slopes are back to store, they are up in a jiffy as soon as you are there !! I don't know how they manage, going up and down the stairs, but the service is fast, efficient and above par, kudos !!!]
