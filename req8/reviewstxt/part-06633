[104310486472645115739,100512875950943032841,This was possibly the worst service I've ever had. I've been here twice and won't be back fr a third go. Tonight we waited 20 minutes for drinks, except our one beer, which after waiting 30+ minutes I went to the bar to get. AFTER I got the beer the bartender took our order. I believe we waited 45 more minutes for the manager to came ask if we had ordered yet and another 15-20 for the food. After that, when the food eventually came out, my boyfriend asked for more chili for his hot dog - there was maybe a table spoon of chili on it - after the rest of us finished eating he eventually got up,went to the window and got it himself.]
