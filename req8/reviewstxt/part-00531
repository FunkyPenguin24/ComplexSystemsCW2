[115981739062722545174,100186584724098334282,My truck was badly damaged on the passenger side - both doors and the truck bed were mashed. When D&M got done with the repair, it looked like new. They changed out all the bent metal for new parts - no bondo. And they resprayed the whole side, to be sure it all matched. Excellent job, and I'll be sure to use them on any future repair work, although I hope I won't get hit by another bone-head any time soon. :-)]
