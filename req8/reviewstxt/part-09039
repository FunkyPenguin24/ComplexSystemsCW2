[117492404965678443925,100641065404826628056,I absolutely LOVE their sushi. I usually get the shrimp tempura roll and the veggie roll (with cucumber and avocado) and I ask them to use brown rice (you have to specify if you want brown). But the best part about this sushi is that it is made right as you wait, and the rice is warm. Everywhere else I've gone for sushi it's cold and there's too much fancy stuff going on (like cream sauces). Seasoned Wok's sushi is basic, but you feel like it's the healthiest stuff on the planet.]
