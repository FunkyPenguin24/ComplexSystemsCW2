[105090934523215104933,101009307418646577670,I was given the opportunity to play this course for the first time and loved the course. It plays long on some holes, especially with the wind. It is a fairly flat course as would be expected playing in the middle of farm fields. The 15th hole is a little deceiving as you are playing over in essence a swamp instead of open water. Great challenge to start a round of golf with a 545 yard par 5 first hole. Overall for the price you pay to play this course, you are getting a great value. We will be back and and my 9 year old is chomping at the bit to try this course as well.]
