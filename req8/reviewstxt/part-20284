[100864131569552858594,100075586920966026827,The guys at IS are just plain amazing. Michael has worked with my family a couple of times now and his friendly personality surpasses "good customer service". When you work with this company you can tell you are working with people who genuinely care about what they are doing. They are passionate and knowledgable when it comes to the technical aspects of photography, but also care and understand a great deal about people. Having worked with many photographers on a professional as well as personal level, I have learned to recognize those that have a true artistic vision and those that just have a nice camera and photoshop skills. IS Photographic is the total package, no matter what your photography needs may be.]
