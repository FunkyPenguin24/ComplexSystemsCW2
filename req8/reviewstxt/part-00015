[101859603272970118049,100159578053424349480,I met a friend at Hunam one night, having barely been aware of its existence before, and it has been my favorite Chinese restaurant since. Best tasting food and excellent service. Get hot tea, it's fun to drink throughout the meal. Food is presented very conveniently. About them being understaffed, I have never waited longer than average for a meal. If they are considered understaffed, hope they do not change this. Expansion leads to streamlining. Efficiency is not ALWAYS best.]
