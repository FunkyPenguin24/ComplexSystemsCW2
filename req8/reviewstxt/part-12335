The staff are friendly and attentive, they have a great location just off of 66, and none of my visits have ever lasted more than 20 minutes! And not because they try to get me in and out as quick as possible like some places. Dr. Ali takes time to answer my questions and they all make sure I'm comfortable. My visits there feel like a walk in the park. There's a reason for their name. Seriously, I would recommend this place to anyone.]
