[104011700112405757116,100959190964034690451,Dr. Craig worked wonders on my neck, back and jaw within months of starting a treatment plan. Since a bad experience in college, I've always been suspicious of chiropractors of being out to take my money for unnecessarily frequent office visits. I was an as-needed patient converted to a regular care plan, and it's been worth the investment. I felt like Dr. Craig spent extra time and care making sure that I was correctly aligned and he addressed all my concerns. I'm also a severe TMJ patient who had relapsed into painful jaw-popping, and the issue has subsided to the point where I rarely think about it. Their front desk staff is terrific. Unfortunately Dr. Craig had heart trouble and doesn't work there anymore, but the other Drs. offer good care at a fairly reasonable price if you don't have insurance coverage like me.]
