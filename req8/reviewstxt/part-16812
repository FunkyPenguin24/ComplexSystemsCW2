[100053933482123693104,101064207348094652514,I've used this cinema many times but a few years ago my boss introduced me to the Wellesley in Wellington, it's a lovely little cinema and you can sit upstairs in the circle too as it used to be a theatre, fair enough it doesn't show many films at a time and not always exactly the film that you want to see but the prices are way better than the Odeon, the staff are friendly and the refreshments aren't too ridiculously priced either, there is also Scotts cinema in Bridgwater which I would say the same for - apart from the old theatre thing so there is no upper circle!! I now only go to the Odeon on a bogof from the local paper, for a kids club movie or to see a live stream of a ballet etc.]
