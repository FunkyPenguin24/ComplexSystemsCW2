[106160656270464727034,100151251515961041424,On Sunday, Nov 24th 2013, I helped my sister and her husband shopping for a car. We were choosing from Mazda 3, Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla and visited the Honda Carland in Roswell as our 2nd stop. After test driving the Civic and a short negotiation, we agreed on a price with the advertised 0.9% APR finance. During the test drive and negotiation, we told the saleswoman Cathy Savage that my sister and her husband just immigrated to the United State for a year. Even though their credit scores are over 780 but they do not have enough traditional credit lines. They do not have any bad credit either. The purpose of the finance is to help build their credit history, so they could buy a house soon. We put 20% down payment for the purchase. We wanted to make sure we could get the 0.9% APR before signing the purchase agreement. We gave them the credit disclosure, SSN, DOB to the finance director George Foster. George came out and shook our hands stating “congratulations, you are approved with the 0.9% APR finance.”. We signed the paperwork. Since it was almost 8:00pm, we could not finalize the financing. They allowed us to drive the car home so we could come back Monday to finish the rest of work. On Monday 25th, we were asked to submit the additional documents including lease agreement, cable, gas, utility bills, w-2, bank statement, SSN cards and green cards. This morning (26th), we were told the APR suddenly became 3.9%. We believe this is a clear cheating on the finance part and we would like to call your attention to the dealership and the two individuals: Cathy Savage and George Foster. We are reporting to regulators on the issue we have experienced.]
