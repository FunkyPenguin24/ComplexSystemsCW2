[114388826325213434900,100623552079695341187,I have been a customer for over a year. Tim and Janna adopt a very personal approach to customer satisfaction by getting to know you and it makes all the difference. They host different social events at their store which invites the sort of personal interaction which permits them to make appropriate recommendations for gifts. Each time I consider a gift for my wife, I call or email and ask for suggestions, Janna pre-selects pieces which she knows will "wow" my wife but stays within budget. The result is a beautiful but affordable gift with tremendous impact. Tim knows watches very well and Passion is the only place I would trust to repair my timepieces.]
