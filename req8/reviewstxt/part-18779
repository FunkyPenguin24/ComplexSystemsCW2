[116696166540120301307,101171149495847925914,I recently started to attend Gracewalk with my wife and three kids. We attend the Saturday at 5:00 P.M. service. Our experience here has been great. The people here are great and I can feel a presence of God with us during the service. The pastors always deliver a strong message that I ponder during the week. They challenge us to me more devoted believers. The music worship team do an awesome job each week. They are a great start to the service. I would recommend this church to all. With the flexabilty of different service, there is no excuse to come join us. God Bless!]
