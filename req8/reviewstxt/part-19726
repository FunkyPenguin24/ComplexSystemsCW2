[100760123727334616712,100045435736228977010,Brought in my Samsung Galaxy S2 and Dr. Rob quoted me $65 to fix the charger port. I returned in an hour to discover the price was lowered to $35 because he was able to utilize a used part rather than a new one....Incredible service. I recommend Rob the Phone Doctor to EVERYONE]
