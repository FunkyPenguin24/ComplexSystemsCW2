[101169397705243038692,101107627092666280737,YOU MUST GO! I've traveled to Cincinnati a bit over the past months for business & always try to stop here. In fact, I'm going there next week & can't wait to eat here! I travel extensively for business, including the US, Canada & Europe & am a total fish/seafood freak! Lemme just tell you, for a land-locked state, the quality is very good & they have a wide selection. They also do a good job of offering unique sides & good cocktails.]
