[100939501446506121596,100802859231315710817,If you don't mind a breakfast that appears to be inspired by AM/PM gas station, a charity mission, or re-heated rations, the Holiday Inn will do. Their rooms are smoke-free and clean, overall. The rates are reasonable, and the hotel is only 45 minutes from Mammoth. We just can't get past the breakfast: very hard biscuits, one kind of diet yogurt, green bananas, refill of bread, knives and edible food was a regular request...even when it was slow.]
