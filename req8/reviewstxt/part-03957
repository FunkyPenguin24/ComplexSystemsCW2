[109944716633324998988,100367055213408150150,Love this place so very much. Tasty, inventive vegan/vegetarian food! Awesome staff. Being a vegan living in Columbus can be difficult. This is one of the only restaurants in town (notable exception is Betty's) where I have to look over the menu for quite some time to make a decision. I love it! My first visit there, a very friendly member of the staff gave my boyfriend and me a whole bag of vegan cookies for free, because "everyone needs cookies". I couldn't believe I was ignorant of this place for so long. They really make you feel like an individual and not just a "patron".]
