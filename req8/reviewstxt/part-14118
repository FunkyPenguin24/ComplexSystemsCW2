[103692451730380982028,100918571761760974944,I visited Dublin Toyota last week to trade-in my leased Prius for a newer model. I would like to place on record my happiness with the purchase experience. Joe T, who showed us the choices available, understood what we were looking for, and took pains to help us identify the right car with a color that we really liked. Then on to the Finance Manager Luis Abreckov â€“ this again turned out to be a very pleasant experience, unlike what we had experienced at Concord Toyota. Luis came across as a genuine person, who cared about the customer, and invested time and effort in understanding his perspective. We came off feeling good about our purchase. I am happy to recommend Luis Abreckov , Joe T and Dublin Toyota for their professionalism and customer-friendly approach.]
