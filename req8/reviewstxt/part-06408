[100036266684204660996,100499101695180567055,We had a great experience at Capital Toyota. They spent an great deal of time helping to make sure we had just the right vehicle for us when we found ourselves back and forth between a couple of models and even arranged for a rather extended test drive since we were going to use this vehicle for a good bit of Interstate driving. There was no pressure to buy one "off the lot" with many offers to find exactly the right combination of features & colors if the perfect one was not on the lot. They did have many on the lot though. The pricing was good. We'd recommend this dealer.]
