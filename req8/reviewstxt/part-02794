[102059754085545795629,100302886912984587050,My friend just complained about apple store sydney, after listened to her disaster, I finally want to write a review for my terrible experience I had a long time ago in this store. I've also been to apple store bondi and broadway, apple store sydney was the WORST store i've ever been to! terrible customer service... just terrible, i doubt whether the so called "GENIUS" in there know how to write the words "customer" and "service", or they just DISCRIMINATE AGAINST Asian people?!! I had terrible experience there for my 4 visits to that store in 2009, 2010 and 2012. it's a waste of time to write down each of them, just wanna say i've never been there again since then, i'd rather travel a long distance to bondi when i got problems with my apple products. stay away from apple store in town hall, i will never forget my terrible experience in that store. if you want to call those blue shirts "GENIUS", you should at least train them properly, not make them feel like they are "geniuses" and customer are just normal people, they are superior than us. don't make me laugh, 'cause they are not, they are customer service people, they should be proud of this rather than being a "genius"!]
