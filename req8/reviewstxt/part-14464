[104386661125141031032,100938272319059931869,I've just been to Sno!Zone for a 3 hour lesson in preparation for a ski trip. The facility is excellent, and I definitely feel that I got my money's worth. There were 5 in our beginner group, though the groups taking the shorter 1 hour lessons did seem larger. The instructor was knowledgeable and friendly, and coped well with the varying levels of ability in our group.]
