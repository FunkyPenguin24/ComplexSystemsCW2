[112527368697773548512,101086430216690358849,I take my dogs and cats to Dr. Graef's animal hospital and have always been pleased and willing to drive over 40 miles each way. His staff is kind and competent. Dr. Graef has always been engaging with me and my kids and provided excellent services to my animals. I've never had an apopintment and my animals have always been seen in the order we arrive. Just Excellent. (I do call ahead to be sure they will be open!)]
