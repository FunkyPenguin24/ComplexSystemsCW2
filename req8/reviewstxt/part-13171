[107666453112628747799,100866615095013547461,The owner Dinardo is extremely rude! We wanted to do our rehearsal dinner here for our wedding. We had set up an appointment to come in and see the place and to have dinner. Dinardo was not present when we arrived. We were shown to the function room by the hostess. The hostess had forced us through the restaurant to see the function room and pointed us in the direction for us to find the other option for us. She was also extremely rude. We had asked if Dinardo was availale to chat and we were relayed that he was too busy. I have worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years and a small business owner myself and know how things work. I know that when someone is coming to check out your restaurant to throw a formal party with 40 people you don't treat them the way myself, my fiance and my Mother were. No good...]
