[114955933845931282618,100842700547619766598,My favorite used bookstore in town. While studying at Western, I often frequented Michael's rather than pay the exhorbitant campus bookstore rates. Their selection is good, the layout is easy to navigate, the staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and I always walked out with at least two books I hand't planned on buying. Also, as a bonus, they have a free pile that turns up the occasional gem--I once found a book by Rudyard Kipling that had been published in 1912! Michael's specializes in BOOKS, so if you're expecting the sort of accoutrements (read: JUNK) that other places display to augment their collections, you should look another place.]
