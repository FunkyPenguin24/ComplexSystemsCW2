[108139351552364199419,100858203938501238079,La Mission was recommended to us by a friend. We really liked it. For $25 I had a seafood plater included soup, a nice fish filet, lobster tail, shrimp and a desert to share. The staff was very friendly and happy to converse in English. Drinks were also reasonably priced. Need a reservation for evenings. I'd go back again.]
