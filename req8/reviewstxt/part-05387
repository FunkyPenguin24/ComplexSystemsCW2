[111291558294180458491,100445879822803985894,I have taken our vehicles here for service for years without questioning their recommendations ... but no more. The reader's digest version ... over a 2 year period they continually mis-diagnosed a heating problem in our Acura 1.7 el (a car you think they'd know about as it's basically an upscale Civic) costing me literally thousands of dollars in service until the engine finally blew a gasket. After the fact I talked to a Honda trained mechanic who based on the description of the original symptoms responded by describing the symptoms as the situation escalated right up to & including the blown gasket ... all without seeing the car and only hearing my explanation of the original symptoms. Had I gone to this guy in the first place it would have saved me enough to buy a decent used car. ... This situation especially bothers me as he said this issue with the engine is not an uncommon one and easily diagnosed & treated. I am not impressed with Oakville Honda's missed diagnosis and failure to make things right after the fact.]
