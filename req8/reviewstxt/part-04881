[109766538395650724391,100417495195911079492,Having participated in the Spring Camp this past weekend and the week camp last year, I can easily say it was one of the best experiences of my life. It's very beautiful country and the staff is amazing. They're really enthusiastic and truly great people. I have kept in touch with many of the staff members from last year and one is now one of my very best friends. The food is wonderful. Last year my Venture Crew and I did a schedule with Kayaking, Climbing, Mountain Biking, Bishop's Castle, Hiking and more. Never once do I remember being bored or hungry or anything like that. There is always something to do. This place is ideal for any scouts. The difficulty varies and there are plenty of Merit Badge classes to take and great people running it. I can't wait until this year and (hopefully) working there next year.]
