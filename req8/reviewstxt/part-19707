[109769845096399939589,100044183116378822433,Why don't they tell per lb cost? Their chicken @ ~$22 / lb are really great! You will do break even with "Whole Foods Market" cost after 70-80% discount. Direct to home delivery and saving distribution cost is "myth" with Passanante. Sales guy was very pushy. Complete waste of 2+ hours with him. Another 10 minutes here in writing this review. Hope it helps you.]
