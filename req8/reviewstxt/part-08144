[107613049430428261952,100595286436478499386,We switched to the birth and womens center at the end of my second trimester because we were really unhappy with our obgyn. I loved the commitment to letting mom and baby be in charge of the birth experience. My husband was glad that Baylor is only three mins away. Turns out we were both right. Baby was born after 3 short calm hours of labor, healthy and beautiful. but due to a 1:3000 complication afterward I was rushed to Baylor for emergency surgery. Beverly was amazing. If I could have more, they'd be born here.]
