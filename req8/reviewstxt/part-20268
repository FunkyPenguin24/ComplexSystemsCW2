[113563264922812240974,100074134092485875849,This place was awful. Even if it is your last resort, don't stay here. We stayed in a 21-person dorm room with tiny beds, there were no lockers to store our belongings, and I'm terrified that I'm going to have bed bugs. There was no hot water in the showers, everything was filthy, and one morning all the bathrooms were closed because the toilets were clogged. It was awful, and we left as soon as we could.]
