[105216024353648171197,101169432086499585834,Jeff Nona is an outstanding attorney. He is professional and personable. What I really liked about him was that he didn't tell me what I wanted to hear, but what I needed to hear. He is a straight shooter who knows his stuff. I could not have been happier with the outcome of my case. He walked me through the process from start to finish, always keeping me informed. The office staff was professional and always available. I highly recommend the Law Office of Jeffery E. Nona without hesitation and would definately use him again if needed.]
