[103905187249554036351,100849810365975364341,Small space big taste, I dont normally try new restaurant's that I find on google maps but im glad I tried this one. Eats good 33 isnt in the greatest location but dont let that deter you, this small restaurant had the best food ive had for long time. With a spanish-american theme eats good 33 try and stay on the healthy track with no fried food and very little butter. If your in the mood for a healthy and delicious meal than head over to good eats for some good eats.]
