[106303555501741083484,101024360722125076658,Really not sure what the fuss is all about. I've been in and out of Mosquito a bunch of times over the past few years; bought a few things, asked a lot of questions, drooled over the odd super-bike and everyone I've delt with has been well informed, friendly and (crucially) patient with my mid-range level of bike knowledge. Are they more interested in selling italian steel to high end punters?..... almost certainly; but I dont recognise at all the rudeness/arrogance suggested in many of the other reviews. Plan to buy a bike there as soon as funds permit.]
