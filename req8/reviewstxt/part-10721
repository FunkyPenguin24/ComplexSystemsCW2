[117935747018776927778,100732607314155287046,This is a great place and right in my neighborhood. I recommend it. But today I had an interesting experience. I went there for lunch and ordered a Reuben sandwich. The menu said "Pastrami, cheese and sauerkraut." Great. I asked the waitress if there was any spread/mustard/mayo on it and she said no. Great. Got the sandwich and it had thousand island on it. I showed the waitress and she said, "That's the sauerkraut." I thought maybe the sauerkraut was mixed in with the TI but when I looked there really was no sauerkraut at all. I asked her if I could have it remade with no TI and added sauerkraut. She said, "We don't really have sauerkraut." So I had a Reuben with no sauerkraut. Took half home and added my own. Delicious! Don't let this deter you....but if you want a real Reuben, ask if they have sauerkraut yet.]
