[110907342794816593781,100209042852769268375,My experience was with the jewelry wing of this store. They have fantastic customer service, plus the appearance of a nice fine jewelry store - but with amazingly low prices and bonus-added for me: treasure-hunting excitement. Walking in past the line of people bringing in their goods surprisingly didn't bother me - we scooted into the jewelry area in a few steps. Kay was so helpful and patient and took her time, really listening to what we were looking for and our price range, and showing us anything that might be made to fit our fingers that there was any chance we might like. We got wedding/engagement rings that (although they are a little more conventional than we were hoping for) are really beautiful, comfortable, and would have been way way way out of our budget at a retail shop. Way more sparkle than I EVER thought I'd wear. They resized and polished within a day. I'm super happy with my experience and the deals we got. I feel like reuse is a responsible way to source precious jewelry, so I feel good about that too. I would recommend this place to any budget-conscious person in search of precious jewelry (especially wedding rings.)]
