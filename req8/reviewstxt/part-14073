[115830301031850500261,100915306062737738803,Putting our puppy, a frisky miniature schnauzer, in the hands of Ali and his team is one of the best decisions we have ever made. Pup left thinking he was the boss and came home walking nicely on the leash, sitting, staying, etc. The K-9 facilities were immaculate, and they took him to a wonderful, wide, grassy field for some of his training. They also took beautiful, professional-quality photos of him and sent them to us! Nice enough for framing. They checked in with us during the week, and they responded to questions immediately. Even after we brought Pup home, they checked in with us and have continued to answer questions when they come up. We definitely will board him with Ali and friends in the future. Can't say enough good things about this group. Very professional, very friendly.]
