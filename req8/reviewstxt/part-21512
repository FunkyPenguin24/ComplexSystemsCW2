[102168158566348071603,100140556233376898951,The food at North China is what keeps us coming back, aside from it's neighborhood convenience! After moving to Dayton, we tried several of the recommended Chinese restaurants with this making our top two of Chinese, along with CJ Chan's. I would recommend everything I have tried including the Moo Shoo Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, and Chicken and Vegetables. The service is also very accommodating - I have a terrible habit of ordering just about everything "my way", and they have ALWAYS gotten it right! Excellent service and surprisingly pleasing decor are the icing on the cake at North China.]
