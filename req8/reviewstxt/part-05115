[106066834258025963576,100429119867100839968,My daughter's birth in February of 2011 was the second time I've used this birth center. Jill was my midwife for the second time! She is awesome. Experienced, compassionate, but very direct when needed, which is awesome when you need focus during labor! I arrived at the birth center at 3 pm just to be checked, discovered I really was going to have a baby that day, ran to get something to eat and was back and delivered my baby at 4:32 pm! Awesome experience. We snuggled and loved our new daughter and then headed home 4 hours after her birth. I could not imagine having to stay in a hospital after delivering a baby. As comfortable and quiet as the birth center is, I wanted to be in my own home, so I couldn't even imagine a busy, noisy hospital with a small bed. It doesn't hurt just to check the center out. It's an option available that every woman should be aware of. They have an open house once a month that is a brief overview of their services. My husband is probably a bigger advocate of the birth center than I am! He is so happy that I made him take a tour when I was 4 months pregnant with our son. He was skeptical at first because it looks nothing like a standard medical facility that society has made us believe is necessary for birth. Birth is not an illness. Unless there are complications, normal birth does not need to be in a hospital.]
