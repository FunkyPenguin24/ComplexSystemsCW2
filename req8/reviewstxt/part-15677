[117278136662133819864,101003530190029075474,Art (and Art's Brewing Supply) has made me ten times the home brewer than I was before. I had been brewing beer for about 18 months and made what I thought were good beers by purchasing kits at The Beer Nut. My first trip to Art's was not what I was expecting. The business itself is located in an old house that is stacked floor to ceiling with grains, malts, etc. Art's desk is next to the door and I ended up talking to him for around 45 minutes before I grabbed a single ingredient from the shelves. Art is very opinionated and is not afraid to express those opinions. After shopping there regularly I have come to understand that Art has a passion for home brewing as a hobby and ultimately he wants to teach others an appreciation for home brewing as a hobby as well. If I could do it over again there is no question in my mind that I would start my adventures in home brewing at Art's. I have now made three beers with his guidance and they have all been amazing. It has actually gotten me much more excited about home brewing and I am excited to try the next recipe. The advice and information I get at Art's is the most valuable thing to me, but that is not the only benefit of shopping there. The ingredients are high quality and fresh. The prices are also excellent. I have actually been able to make stronger brews for the same price as I used to pay at the Beer Nut for kits because I can spend more money on malt. If you want to take your brewing to the next level I highly recommend heading to Art's.]
