[116836834856703596347,100152284704111003251,I've used Ace Computing a couple of times now and thought I would add a review as its refreshing to find an honest, reliable and affordable place to take your computer when it needs some TLC. Steve from Ace Computing has always offered a professional and prompt service. He fixed an xbox 360 on the first occasion after i'd spent days trying to make it work, Steve did it within an hour. This time my son managed to break the screen on the laptop, and this was quickly fixed and back to as new condition within no time and at a fair price too. Thank you and if i have any computer related problems in the future, I will be back!!]
