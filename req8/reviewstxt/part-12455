[103162961291864050919,100826022540607438563,I recently purchased a new 2013 GMC Terrain from Dennis at Prime Buick GMC in Hanover. I was very impressed with the facility, along with the helpfulness of Dennis. He spent plenty of time with me, making sure I purchased the vehicle that would fit me the best. On the day I took delivery of my Terrain, Dennis also spent a good amount of time with me, setting up my OnStar, BlueTooth, and showing me how everything else works. I never felt rushed or pushed into any purchase at any time. Additionally, Dennis has continued to contact me, making sure I am completely satisifed with my purchase; which I am. I would recommend Dennis to anyone who is in the market to buy a new or pre-owned vehicle!]
