[111739434261097948863,100097805252328963610,It sucks how so many attorneys can't be trusted nowadays. You can add Seppi Esfandi to that list. He is just looking to take your money and hand your case over to some newbie attorney who has no idea what he is doing. I was given all this bull about Seppi's reputation and his record, but you won't even get him as a lawyer. This is the a bait and switch operation they will sell you an attorney with experience and as soon as you pay they switch you to an attorney who only cares about getting paid.]
