[111661299918128467370,100308777172468287581,After doing my diligence and research about tires, I found Tire Hut online by accident while searching for the best rate on Suimitomo Tires for my Lexus LS430 L with 19" rims. All the rims were good. I requested a quote on line and the GM Jerry emailed me back before the end of the day with a quote and all of the important information I would need to know when making the right decision about my purchase. The cost of the tires new were about 35% below the best price I could find for the new tires, balance and installation and disposal fee. The next day, I went to his location in Sunrise by 8:00 AM on a Saturday. They took my car right away and I was out by 9:10 AM. Jerry R. was a consummate professional, concerned and caring about my experience and being concise with regards to my services. I would highly recommend Tire Hut to anyone and everyone seeking a great price for new tires and outstanding service. Thank you Jerry & Thank you Tire Hut. JB Jeffrey Bryer]
