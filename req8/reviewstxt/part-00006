[100291480018077822900,100159056091734146494,We were really excited about the apartment because for three of us in a two bedroom the price was good and they were brand new. That went downhill quickly unfortunately when the only assigned parking spot we received was uncovered and whoever got left without the spot has to park a block away where people like to break into cars because there is NO open parking anywhere. The flooring in the apartment has warped and bubbled up in a lot of places, the faucets leak at the joints and drip at the end, and the shower head has fallen off multiple times. Being right next to trax is convenient but SO LOUD. The management doesn't care about complaints or concerns, and tend to be unresponsive or rude. There is dog poop all over the place because people have no manners and management doesn't take the time to do anything about it. Cars are constantly being broken into. The pools are tiny, and they close them at ten so anyone with a late shift can't get in and the gym is tiny and useless. The fire alarms go off sometimes for no reason and once the apartment above us had the sprinklers go off inside and drained down to ours. Over all it is obvious to state we are not going to stay here, and i do not recommend living in this complex for the price or the management.]
