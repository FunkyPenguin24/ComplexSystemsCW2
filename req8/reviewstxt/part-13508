[102521587200174207713,100885737208116286934,About 20 minutes after hailing a cab and there was still nothing, I called the company and explained that I had to get to the greyhound bus station to get back home in time for my classes back in Arizona. The lady on the phone spoke english as a second language and did not understand a good amount of what I was saying and told me that the cab would be there in 30-45 minutes which is about 10 minutes too late of me getting to the greyhound. I missed my bus because of them and they cost me a lot of money just to get home. If you use this company, call them two hours ahead and expect them to be late.]
