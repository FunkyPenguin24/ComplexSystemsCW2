[113721700364574888342,100741900238959636924,I was recently involved in a car accident and took my 2006 Jeep to be repaired at Jerry Seiner Collision Center in Salt Lake City, Utah. Brian Larremore handled my vehicle was wonderful! He has great communication skills, and the turn around time was as he predicted. I highly recommend anyone who needs auto body repair to visit Brian at Jerry Seiner Collision Center.]
