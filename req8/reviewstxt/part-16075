[108415114966292948356,101025096223399496553,Wanted to simply replace pads and rotors on one axle on a 3 year old car with 70K miles. The price quoted over the phone was competitive. However, when I got there they quoted a price that was 500% higher to do complete brake over-haul on all 4 wheels. They insisted it had to to be done. I took it to an independent shop who looked closely at all the brakes and only replaced what needed to be replaced for the fraction of what Car-X demanded. This shop, including the managers lacks integrity and I feel they purposefully and intentionally attempted to create a larger job-order for themselves. I'd warn folks to be skeptical of the advice and service suggestions made by this shop; they lack integrity and professionalism and there are far batter options in Madison.]
