[100940159519457427006,100142437363329876606,Food was good as usual, but I was shocked with Racist behaviour of the staff. Me and My wife (we are Indians) went there on Friday evening at around 8:30 couple of weeks back. As we enter there were two tables free on front side of the restaurant adjacent to front Glass. We requested that we would like to sit on one of those table, waiter told us that area is getting closed and asked us to sit area behind near the back side of the restaurant. We agreed and "co-incidentally" were made to sit next to another India couple. We still did not suspect anything. But as time went on and we ordered and yet we realised area where we initially requested to sit was given to new customer not to mention all white skinned. We finished at 10 and that area was still full with new customers eating happily. I was really furious and asked the same waiter why he did not let me sit there and he had not proper answer. These things really make you feel sick after living in London for 7 years you still has to face such a racial behaviour.]
