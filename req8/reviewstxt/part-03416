[102028836563196736631,100336221095623486469,A truly *delightful* experience for your next night out with friends, family and/or colleagues. An incredible mix of songs filled the air (from Vampire Weekend to Lorde and more), amazing paintings covered the wall before us, and an engaging instructor provided exceptional, laid back guidance as we turned blank canvases into one of a kind paintings which reflected our own unique perspective- all culminating in an atmosphere of constant INSPIRATION and relaxation. To say it was remarkable would be an understatement. This is a MUST try experience for painters, non-painters, travelers and locals alike! I'm definitely looking forward to going back!]
