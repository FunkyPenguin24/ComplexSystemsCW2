[106204761064057411453,100235842734477188424,First time trying Odd Moe's and my wife and I are kind of pizza snobs (lived in Chicago for 9 years). Gal on the phone was nice and patient answering our questions. Delivery was fast and driver was a cool dude. The pizza was absolutely awesome! We had the Greek and the crust, sauce and ingredients were top notch. Highly recommended.]
