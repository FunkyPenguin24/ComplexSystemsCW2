Great barbers who keep it simple and right. If you work in the downtown area (or just live in El Paso) and need a barber, try out this place. These guys will leave you with a good haircut, cleaned up and feeling good. ****4 stars because it can be a difficult process in finding a barber. This place will end your search.]
