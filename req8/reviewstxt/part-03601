[103535649942772237246,100346328779529816051,TERRIBLE. After a long tiring day, after two high school auditions, I decided I wanted some Chinese food as a reward. And this is the closest place to my house. So I decided to order. Delivery time, and food quality were absolutely terrible. Did I mention that if you order online your order has to be over 10 dollars if you want it deliver? What if i don't wanna pay 10 dollars for extra food? What if I just wanna buy one thing? I can't. It needs to go over 10 dollars. Absolute crap. Never buy anything from this place.]
