[115765025853786490138,100339451247762354289,Consider yourself a very lucky person if you live near Princeton BJJ and have the opportunity to train here on a regular basis. Emily and Art are excellent instructors that explain not only moves, but concepts extremely well. The people I have met at this academy were open and honest people, willing to meet me at my level instead of trying to run me over. I never once felt inferior, in fact, I felt that the practitioners here were trying to bring out the best in me and my BJJ.]
