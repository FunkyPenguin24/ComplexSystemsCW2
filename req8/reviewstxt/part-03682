[117709782500959720386,100352152607259052442,This was not our first time at the West End Grill, but it will be our last. I was so incredibly sickened after a dinner there, that I spent 24 hours practically immobile. My husband had a very bad reaction as well. Whether it was old seafood (Scallops smelled of ammonia), or something else, this purportedly high-end restaurant should be far more selective and careful about the food they serve their customers.]
