[117381919213461983671,100687165184167601463,This is a great office space. The building itself has established some hefty security procedures but it does feel pretty nice going up 43 floors and looking over all of Manhattan. There is a great view of the Empire State building and good lighting on the floor. The staff is very friendly, and extremely helpful.]
