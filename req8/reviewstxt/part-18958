[106262880832494507050,100003906177349895334,It's Christmas Eve 2013, 3:30 am and my heat pump air handler fan quit. I waited until 7:00 am and called a competitor and left a message. No one returned my call. At 7:30 am, I called Hometown and spoke with the owner. David said he could be here in about an hour. He arrived in 45 minutes and quickly discovered the problem. In less than 30 minutes my system was running fine. The next time I have any problem with an HVAC unit, I'm calling Hometown Heating and Cooling. I really like the way the company treats its customers.]
