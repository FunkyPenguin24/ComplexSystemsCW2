There has not been a single time that I have purchase food from this place that they did not mess it up one way or another. If you order a salad, they will give you the wrong one; if they give you the right one, it means they did not give you a dressing. Order a "sour cream" and chive baked potato? Well then expect to only get only the baked potato without any sour cream. If you check your order and something is missing, better start honking your horn because as soon as you touch the bag of food they are passing to you, the window is slammed closed and the employee runs away. So you have to wait there honking until they decide to return. How hard is it to put stuff in a bag?!]
