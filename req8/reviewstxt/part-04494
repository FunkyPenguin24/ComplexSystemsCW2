[103741726484747747845,100397770141157120311,We had such a great experience working with Adam. He was extremely professional and responsive to my emails when setting up our appointment. He was so easy to work with. We got our family portraits taken and he made the experience very relaxing and fun! He had our proofs ready for reviews exactly when he said he would. He really made the whole process from start to finish easy, professional and comfortable. Not to mention he is one of the most talented photographers that I have worked with. We are more than happy with the way our pictures turned out. Thanks Adam!]
