[113889820509013863252,100402226318821867529,A wonderful place to stay with your family, next to colva beach and all the things that a family may think of while planning for a holiday are here. An exquisite property maintained amicably with high ambiance and best part is staff is cooperative beyond imagination. Rooms & Dining Area: To start with room was neat and tidy, Room service was good, hot running water 24 hours, dining area/in-house bar on first floor, with opening towards sea gave a wonderful view. Pool Area: Pool Area had sun bath beds, clean water with available attendant during pool open timings and was neatly maintained. Food: Good as felt like home. Health Club: Feel need to do some improvement here, adding more machines, Otherwise basic machines for cardio are available. Ayurvedic Massaage: Available at Hotel but did not try. Ambience: Excellent, No match No comparison. Overall: Excellent place, loved the resort, visiting again in Feb 2013 and have pre-booked my room in same hotel.]
