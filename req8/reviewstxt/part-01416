[105055099086984253132,100231985944964641211,My house was in desperate need of repair after much neglect on my part. The paint was peeling, the gutters were rusted, and the soffits were falling off. I contacted three contractors and two were comparable and one was much higher. Exovations was the last contractor I contacted and they scheduled a very convenient appointment. Katie Ward was my sales consultant and showed up on time for the appointment. She knew what she was talking about and made a great suggestion on how they could do a portion of the front porch differently to make it look better, I ended up going with her suggestion and it looks great. Exovations price was comparable to the other exterior contractor I had contacted and I decided to use Exovations due to their warranty and the products they install. I decided to replaced my cedar siding with the Certainteed cedar lap fiber cement siding, they also replaced all the eaves, fascias, and soffits with Certainteed fiber cement product. Jim McCulloch was my project manager and he was also on time with every appointment. I had decided to replace the windows and exterior doors myself and he set up the work schedule to work around me. All of the crews worked fast and stayed on schedule despite a couple days of rain. They cleaned up at the end of the day everyday and didn't damage anything. It didn't all go smoothly but nothing ever does, what counts is they went back and made everything right. They also painted everything and installed new gutters. Now my house looks brand new and will be much lower maintenance. They stuck to the price of the original contract and didn't try to add anything in the middle of the project. I was skeptical of all the positive reviews I had read before the project but I am now a believer. They were great from beginning to end and I have no reservations about recommending them, I would definitely use them again.]
