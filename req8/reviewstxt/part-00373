[108295437160247016511,100178595872581414651,Completely disappointed with my lunch TWICE now! I went in earlier this week, ordered soup to go, got back to my office and it was the wrong soup! So, I went back to redeem a free cup of the correct soup today. I was extra hungry so I ordered the "Old Goat" Grilled Cheese. The sandwich wasn't even grilled! The cheese wasn't melted, and the bread was soggy and not toasted. Not to mention, my "sweet potato black bean soup had 2 cubes of sweet potato in the entire cup. I want my $4.25 back for the "not-grilled" cheese. Argh.]
