[110085117293529308509,100253289017307437280,Rented out the private party room this past weekend for a double birthday party. We had about 35-40 guests and fit perfectly with tables and chairs for those who wanted to sit as well as plenty of room for people who wanted to stand and mingle around. The room was spacious, clean, well laid out, with its own bathroom off of the kitchen and they let us plug in our own ipod for the room. Christen (the lady I was in contact with to set up the event) was fully accommodating and responded to all of my emails/texts in a timely manner. We had a personal waiter for our party room who went above and beyond to keep everyone happy and a drink in our hands at all times and was happy to do separate checks (no idea how he kept track of everyone but he really did an excellent job). There is a $500 minimum that you have to reach by the end of the night to guarantee the party room but I'm sure we way surpassed that, even with the $5 well drink special they offered us (we had the room for 4 hours). We brought a cake and they were happy to keep it in the fridge for a few hours as well as provide plates and forks (they even washed off my cake plate after!!) I would 100% recommend Double Wide as a place to rent out for a birthday party or other casual event and I am looking forward to reserving the room again for a future party. cheers!]
