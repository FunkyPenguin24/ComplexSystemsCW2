[105739140768003656918,100470907117624066409,Love coming here. I'm a graphic designer and work from home most days. I do enjoy it, but I really like the change of scenery and connecting with other business professionals. I can get work done and it also helps to be able to get some feedback on my designs. In the interest of full disclosure, I do most of the design work for Coworking Connection and trade the work for my membership dues.]
