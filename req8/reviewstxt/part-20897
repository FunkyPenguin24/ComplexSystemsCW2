[118162389703634262820,100107962856158747635,Love this facility, staff is very friendly, we have a dog who is very nervous around other people & animals, and they do their best to make him more comfortable when we come in for classes, the trainer for obedience & agility is wonderful, we have learned so much about our dogs. Will definitely recommend this facility to others. Dan & Mallory have done a great job!!!]
