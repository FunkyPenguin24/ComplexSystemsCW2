[107034805661046514217,100775995529145156762,I called twice to make an appointment for my sister and mom and I to have side by side pedicures. We did this last summer and it was wonderful. When I tried to make an appointment this year, I called a month in advance and they said they didn't have their schedule open yet. so I tried again two weeks later. they said they only had one gal working that day and that they would try and get two more and call me back. I never heard back. So I made the effort to go into the spa and try in person. I explained what had happened so far and they were very apologetic and that their manager would call me once they could get the schedule sorted. They never called. This is ridiculous. what kind of spa only has one nail tech on a SUNDAY IN AUGUST. when we went last year, they were fully booked the entire time we were there and there were 4 nail techs. I also tried for the Saturday before thinking maybe they would have more nail techs on a Saturday. Same thing....very disappointed.]
