[104066059189034178504,100168019117720175709,Probably the best pub in the World! I was born and raised, and, have lived and worked in the North all my my life and The New Bee Hive is one of the best pubs I have been to - a perfect combination of great beers, a Juke Box (is it still there?) with what apperred to be my CD collection loaded into it, amazing!, a pool table, a variety of smaller snug rooms, real fires (are they still there?) and a night club in the cellar, awesome! It's up there with The Fighting Cock and The Shoulder of Mutton, Kirkgate but more.]
