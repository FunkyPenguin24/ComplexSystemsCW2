[105804352123309044390,101138067403703393462,We had dinner on Oct. 14, 2013 and it was spectacular. The service, ambience and food were all five-star. We especially enjoyed our steaks that were tender, flavorful and cooked perfectly. We liked the fact that the noise level was relatively low and we could talk comfortably.]
