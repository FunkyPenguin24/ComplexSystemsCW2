[116123757257136195539,100023564540882368315,Wedding planning can be the most stressful thing for a person to do. Fortunately, with Simple Pleasures Travel, our honeymoon to Hawaii was not one of those things! From the very first time that Lisa and I met with Laura, she was so knowledgable about the traveling experience and very much on top of things when it came to setting up our package. Laura was extremely helpful in keeping my wife and I appraised of the activities in Hawaii and the pricing and booking of hotels and flights. When we actually got to Hawaii, all we had to do was sit back and relax! Laura was even instrumental in making sure that we had what we needed for our wedding night in Austin. Laura's an awesome planner; we've already referred her to some friends of ours to plan their vacation, and we'll definitely be recommending her to everyone we know! Thank you so much Laura!]
