[107506336976144360558,100438115360263773714,Walked in and was immediately given a pleasant welcome. Two people waiting ahead of me and Fox News was on TV so the wait time went quick. $15 haircut and I was satisfied. Apparently the family also owns the Korean restaurant next door so I went in and ordered their special. I suspect Han's wife runs that place. Also good. Plentiful parking and comfortable place. I am new to the area so this was a find for me and I'll go back. I'm not sure the barber (Han?) understood what I said I wanted but he did a good careful job and vacuumed up the hair trimming so they didn't end up inside my collar. Very quick job too.]
