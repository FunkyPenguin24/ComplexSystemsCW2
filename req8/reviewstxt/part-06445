[114301775595628149281,100501779471538062492,OMG. The beds here are so heavenly, I usually didn't manage to make it to the free breakfast because it felt too good to want to move. The pool was warm and clean and the whirlpool was divine. Too bad they don't allow pets. One of the best places I've ever stayed. Can't say enough good things.]
