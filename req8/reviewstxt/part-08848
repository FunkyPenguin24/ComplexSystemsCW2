[100795275424260634652,100630159633711290573,My husband ordered the food online for dinner around 730 and he went to pick it up and returned home around 8pm. He enjoyed his shrimp with lobster sauce but my beef and mushroom was too salty. My fried rice was too salty as well. These cooks should taste their food before serving it to customers. I could not finish my food. That will be the first and last time I eat Wok On Wheels.]
