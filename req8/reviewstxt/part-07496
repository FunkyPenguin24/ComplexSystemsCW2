[103017662857188674356,100560390485627000292,Service was performed within more-than-reasonable time, and I always appreciate the explanation (and visual demo) of work performed. I also appreciated "heads-up" explanations of work that may come up in the near future as the car ages. Above all, the kind and caring attention they gave me since I was there with a newborn!!! GREAT work everyone. Thanks, I'll always return to this dealership, EVEN for oil changes, etc.]
