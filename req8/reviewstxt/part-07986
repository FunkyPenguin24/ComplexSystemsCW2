[107887963570412376482,100587027539192453766,For those of you PROUD to live in the ghetto! Then MOUNTIANSIDE VILLAGE APARTMENTS are for you! You get trash by your apartment, kids leaving things everywhere. Old dusty cars that are all banged up, just sitting there take up a parking spot.. Loud neighbors all thought out the night! And leaving beer cans and cigarette buds everywhere.. The So-called “Security” just walks along the outside talking on their cell phone and smoking. And when you really can’t sleep cause of all the noise and you call them.. Guess what? they don’t come or do anything! You would think a place that is located near the University would be nice right!> Well not here you pay more because of the fact it is located close to the university, but with all the ghettoness! Can not wait for my lease to be us and go back to LIDO apartments.. If you really do take pride in where you live then They would be where you want to go… IDK why I left from there for this crappy place!!!!]
