[110572429221924851154,100712889293841280108,In the market for a vehicle was actually looking into a Toyota got to the dealer and liked the new silverado. I was dealing with these guys for about a week when I got the call saying we have reached an agreement on price. A couple days later I told the salesman I would be in there later that day and when I got in there he had the truck ready all the paper work ready so I starting filling out everything I needed for financing then about 3 hours later the sales man returned and said they messed up and were trying to add 2k to the deal they negotiated down to Adding 500 on but I still wasnt making a deal. They call this sales technique BAIT AND SWITCH they got me back into the store at one price and tried adding to it after we already signed all the paperwork. They already charge a $200 doc fee then also try adding more before the deals over.]
