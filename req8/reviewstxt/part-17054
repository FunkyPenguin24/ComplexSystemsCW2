[102030868063060839934,101079175119876022538,my 02 S80 was suffering a major power steering leak. European Auto Works was able to quickly diagnose the problem, and even though they didn't have the required part on hand to fix the issue, they were able to have it on hand the next day. The problem was fixed quickly and at a very fair price. The staff is very knowledgeable, personable and courteous, something you don't see too much of when it comes to auto shops!]
