[100797166805346478162,100941528857038091793,Can't say enough good things about Scott Smith and his team at Academy Mortgage. Scott was the last loan officer I sat down with prior to accelerating the purchasing process and I was very fortunate that we crossed paths. Scott is ridiculously knowledgeable on the various types of loans and what properties to employ them on (be it a standard fha, fha 203k, conventional, types of loans for flips, etc), which gave me an upper hand once I was ready to pull the trigger on a property. The best part about working with Scott is that he takes the time to explain all of the working parts of each loan; clarity that was refreshing as this was my first home purchase. He truly works to build a relationship so that you'll be a repeat client. Scott has definitely earned my future business, and I already recommend him to all of my friends/family.]
