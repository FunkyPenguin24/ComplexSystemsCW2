[103564905356975913234,100920418164208936226,I love this homebrew shop. It is small, comfortable, the prices are always very appropriate. The staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. The ingredients are always fresh and the staff goes to great lengths to assure this. I have shopped at Above the Rest about 2-3x per month for the past 2 years and have won several first and second place medals from brews made from ingredients sourced from their shop. The 50 lb "virtual bag of grain" for under $35 is a great deal and it cut my brewing costs in half. I shop at Above the Rest almost exclusively because they have treated me as a knowledgeable and dedicated brewer from day one...which is not always the case at local brew stores.]
