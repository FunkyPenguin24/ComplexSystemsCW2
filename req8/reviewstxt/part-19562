[101519978428530437259,100036575568141980083,I've been a patient at this office since before Dr. Lopez took over. I'll admit I was nervous; who isn't nervous when a "new" doctor takes over your care?! I was instantly at ease with Dr. Lopezâ€™s friendly personality and thorough care. I love, love, LOVE Dr. Lopez and his entire staff! I recommend him (them) to anyone looking for a dentist. They are an attentive, knowledgeable, and cheery bunch, and I look forward to every visit.]
