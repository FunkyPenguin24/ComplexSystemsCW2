[106050343379404303176,101131694422859337164,Great experience. Dr. Collins was extremely professional and knowledgeable. I went in to have my prescription checked and he was very nice and had the answers to all of my questions. He even entertained my kids. I hope not to have to go back any time soon but when I do, Dr. Collins is definitely where I'll go. Thanks Dr. Collins.]
