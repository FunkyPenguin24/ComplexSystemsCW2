[103438272701643418051,100430334625598493670,Very expensive shipping that takes a very, very long time. If you're going to make me pay for shipping, at least make sure it takes less than a month to get to me. Yeah... it took a month.Actually, the first half of the order only took a week. But, it was the wrong bulb. Not even close. Based on the other reviews though, I'm not going to attempt to return the thing. I'm sure it'll cost me more in shipping than I paid for the bulb in the first place.]
