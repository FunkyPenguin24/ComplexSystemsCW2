[100670847511732415219,101044444928301134225,Highly recommended. A few of us rented ski packages over the weekend including skis, boots, and poles. The equipment rented were in top-notch shape! In addition, goggles and helmets were also provided at no extra cost (while supplies last). Surprisingly, these were also in good condition!! My buddies also rented some ski jackets, which were clean and worth the rental costs. They were considering buying new jackets, but in hindsight, renting actually made the most sense. The guys working there were really helpful and flexible with pickup and drop-off times. We will definitely be back again.]
