[104504667352857661136,100323106230019819999,I love this place, it's like a dine-in fast food experience but with asian food. Hainanese chicken rice is so fresh and light, beautifully steamed chicken every time. The laksa is superb too. You can't complain with great service and very cheap pricing. It's not somwhere to sit for a long lunch, but for a short, quick lunch with really good food - highly recommended.]
