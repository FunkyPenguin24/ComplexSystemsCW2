[101166382102259996957,100834643422134899289,I just went to this place for the first time last night and it was great! Really good atmosphere, staff was busy but were pleasant and the food was to die for! I had the ribs and they had plenty of meat on them. Their sauce was great (I had the texas pit sauce) and so was the potato salad (a personal favorite). Highly recommend!]
