[100334484591403246244,100254773447471608414,I ordered cheese filled bread sticks and pizza. Reminiscent of bulk frozen Sam's Club and Totino's frozen pizza. Laborious "service" with a scowl. Locals joint for folks without the time and/or taste to make it into Cincinnati. Only suitable for the very hungry. The wait time could have been spent driving to something better. The coffee was horrible.]
