[108784198831660403931,100423372237329941989,I'm a current resident here and it very good considering the price and location. The grounds are kept very clean. I see cleaners cleaning the halls, steps, and laundry room every day. Front office is nice and respectful. I only have two real complaints. Maintenance doesn't show up with any urgency. Also the surrounding area about two blocks away is pretty shifty. So far I have enjoyed my residency and plan to resign my lease when the time comes.]
