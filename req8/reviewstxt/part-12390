[107202845719242829637,100822747845063744357,What ever you do DO NOT RENT HERE go elsewhere.. Roaches and Bedbugs... (funny thing I have a professional cleaning service that deep cleans my apartment on a weekly basis, and my carpet people come and wash my carpet on an every 3 month basis, roaches and bedbugs are not because of lack of cleanliness on my part but a lack of concern from the management at this property) Inconsintent rules and treatment,because they play favorites with their tenants.. rude staff from the top down!! Starting from their Region Field Manager to their ground maintance people. I could sit here and give examples, but no matter how I state what goes on in this property starting with their lack of systems and lack of personell training and lack of customer service from the top down, it wont even begin to shed light to how dirty and unprofessional this property and staff is. My quality of life has deminished because of their lack of professionalism and lack of systems and rules and their treatment is borerline discriminatory! Yea ....they have an indoor pool.... that is down for at least a couple of days a week and their jacuzzi samething, GO ELSE WHERE!]
