[109252219805400907160,100092744582902489170,To Whom It May Concern, I moved from Columbus, Georgia about 6 months ago back to the City Of Asheboro, North Carolina so I could be near my four kids. We moved into a rental property that J & S Wholesale & Rentals owns at: 110 Atlantic Ave., Asheboro, NC 27205. This is a very old rental house that needs alot of work done to it by the owner. He needs to have all the windows in this house taken out and replaced with the newer windows after he paints it and put installation in the walls so the house can be warmer in the Fall & Winter. It needs work done to the wooden porch and wooden steps. The garage area needs to be completely redone. My husband and I only had to pay $295.00 a month and we had to pay our own utilities. We wasn't too happy with living in this old rental house at all because my husband is on disability and he couldn't afford to fix it up at all! My personal advise to anyone that wants to rent from J & S Wholesale & Rentals you need to make sure you check out their rental properties real good before you decide to sign a rental lease agreement with them because they will not fix everything you want them to fix while you are renting from them. I wouldn't definitely not recommend you to rent this rental property from them, until this old rental house has been completely remodeled because it definitely needs alot of work done to it to be a safe place to live and it needs alot of electricial work done to it upstairs and downstairs does. We recently just moved from it in January 2013 because it's too cold right now to live in it.]
