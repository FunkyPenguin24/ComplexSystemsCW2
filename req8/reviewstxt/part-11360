[102211908635428606305,100766961401305496604,It is sad as at one time this was a land mark. The only thing good I can say is the staff was friendly. The chips tasted of old dirty oil. I ordered the green chili burro, it had very little meat and what meat there was, was chewy and fatty. Their enchilada sauce and hot sauce taste only of chili powder, which don't get me wrong, I like, but this was over powering with no depth of flavor. All and all, I would not recommend, although I know a lot of people who like their breakfast.]
