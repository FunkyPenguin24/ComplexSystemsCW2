[105479606235118647543,100842979737758779726,If there is anyone who has a fear of the Dentist, they should go here. Their fears will all be laid to rest. I have had two major procedures that I thought would leave me in pain. The dentist and assistant told me I might be in a little bit of pain when leaving the office. Both times, I went home pain free. No pain while there, no lingering pain after. The ENTIRE staff is very friendly. Not just customer service polite, but actually friendly. Dr. Collier is friendly and straightforward. I do not ever feel as if I am being told I need something done just because it is going to add to the bill. If they tell me I need something done, they explain exactly why and what it takes to have it done. The reception area is always clean and neat and comfy (though I have never spent much time there). The exam rooms are clean and neat. The assistant or receptionist always asks if I want the TV on a certain channel. I would recommend Dr. Collier to everyone.]
