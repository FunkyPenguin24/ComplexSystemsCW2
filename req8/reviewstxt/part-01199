[105988758903819281526,100221203435767753852,I worked here for quite sometime, food and coffee is good, I loved the customers and my coworkers... and it SUCKS to see so many bad reviews about customer service... Customer service sucks because one person is scheduled to work morning rush. Being stressed or overwhelmed you forget to do things for the customer, it's not good for business or the customers satisfaction obviously. From my experience employees try their hardest to assure the customers have a good experience... but you can't be barista, cook, server and hostess all at once. Simple solution for a simple problem.]
