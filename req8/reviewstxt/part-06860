[113380068739723542496,100525173512711943818,This review is a long time coming. We hired Canine Dimensions to help us with some behavior problems in our one year old spaniel. (I had a woman tell me at a dog show when she saw me having troubles with him that this dog didn't have an obedience problem but a behavioral problem!) He is a show dog and has obedience titles but we were having difficulties with food aggression and dominance issues. We realized that we didn't have the knowledge to deal with these issues and would have to learn them from a professional. That is when our research began to bring someone into our home to teach US what to do for our beloved pet. We chose Canine Dimensions and Mike was our teacher. They weren't the cheapest nor the most expensive but after researching and speaking to folk on the phone, we decided they were the most knowledgeable and fairly priced. To say we are so pleased with the service is an understatement. We now have a wonderful dog--still full of vinegar--but now so much more manageable ever since we had Mike teach us how to deal with such a dominant, powerful dog. We cannot thank them enough and it was worth every penny!!!]
