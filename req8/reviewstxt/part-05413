[106987525642425437073,100447050986788391753,I've rented at several storage facilities over the years, and this is one of the nicest I've ever seen. The facility is exceptional, being a converted Kmart store. Security cameras, a locked compound, keyfob entry, clean, air conditioned ... everything you could want in a storage unit, together with very helpful people in the office. Highly recommended!]
