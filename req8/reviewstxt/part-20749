[107439028269029526878,100099375296176496133,The sales & finance team are top notch at Universal Ford. Unfortunately, the quality of work by the service department is the worst we ever experience. After giving them three chances, we asked for our money back for the gold card we purchased and are in the process of looking for a new garage. Don't get disappointed like we were. Purchase your vehicle here but do yourself a favour, have your service done elsewhere.]
