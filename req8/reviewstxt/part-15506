[108241954326092006410,100994039772841780753,Bacon Brunch at the Sage General Store is one of mans greatest achievements. Some say landing on the moon, others might say the pyramids, or the Great Wall of China. But none of those can compare to a 3 course meal all based around bacon. This is what humans were meant to do, put bacon in as many food stuffs as possible. Also the food at Sage is just really good, local, and tasty. The service is good but the food is a little pricey for some. I think its worth it but people who don't want their food to be fair trade or local might think otherwise. Plus BACON BRUNCH!]
