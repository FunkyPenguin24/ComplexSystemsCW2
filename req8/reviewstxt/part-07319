[115663318709993029525,100550422912928062682,Much like his Father, Peter Manka Jr. has a great ability to make everyone who walks through the doors of Ben Garelick Jewelers feels like family. With a business founded on hard work and integrity, Ben Garelick Jewelers is the gold standard of service in the fine jewelry industry. My most recent purchase was an engagement ring that I ordered sight unseen from across the country. It was delivered overnight from Buffalo to San Diego, on-time with a hand written thank you note. I am so grateful to Peter and his wonderful family for providing such genuine service through the years! Salute!]
