[116115279536738650265,101154672680137075246,Fit 'n' Furry is the best! I bring both of my big dogs here 4 or 5 days a week for daycare and the occasional overnight stay. They always have a great time and come home tired and well-exercised, so I don't have to take them out again after I get off work. All of the staff is helpful and courteous and seems to really know and care about all of the dogs that are there. Highly recommend!!]
