[106933338318511986185,100908367193062328906,My car was totalled in an accident. I was hard pressed to find a vehicle that met my needs and within a deadline after dealing with Insurance. I was referred to Kevin Swindall by a former co-worker who had a wonderful experience. I had a flawless experience and Kevin Swindall is the best you could wish for in a salesman. He was nothing but help from the beginning, and was very accommodating! Everyone I encountered at the Dealer, from Kevin to the financial department to the secretary, were a blessing in a rough time of my life! I would reccommend Sandy Springs Ford and Kevin Swindall to any friend or family member anytime!]
