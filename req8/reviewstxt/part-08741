[112339779464450688521,100625599848253720937,This restaurant is the best in OV. My wife and I go there at least once a week. Specials every nite, Thursdays are Greek special nites. Cool background music all the time, whoever makes that happen has great taste. Bfast any time. Bowl of spicy homemade chili over a side of mashed taters is one of my fave budget meals, good for lunch or dinner.They make their own desserts which are fantastic. When the weather's nice you can dine outside. We're there so often we consider the folks that work there as friends. They even have wi-fi. We love this place!]
