[117088314461791482174,100743703379158794570,I'm Mexican but I I like to speak English and believe that ANYONE working in any type of business should be able to understand and speak the English language. The male that answered the phone should be no where near one, I knew he was Mexican but decided to speak in English. If your answering the phone, you better be able to take my order. Even though I speak spanish, it was hard to understand the English of the male that was taking my order. Spoke clearly for him and was not able to understand me, got my address wrong and stated that his location doesnt deliver so far. Made male aware that I was in the same area as store location and to verify address again. Male had someone else take my order. The second person was courteous and took my order without a problem. I ordered delivery and it got here in a timely fashion. I ordered a pan pepperoni pizza and it was delicious, still hot in the box and perfect the way i like it. Other than the "Paisa" that was trying to take my order, overall experience was good.]
