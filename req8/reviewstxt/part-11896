[105468660926438534435,100795586380265949443,I currently live in Village on Post Oak. It's a cool place, the office staff is really nice, and Sandy is the best. The apartments are priced really well, the only draw back I have about them is they are surrounded by ghetto apartments. But all in all I really like living here, and I plan on staying here for a while.]
