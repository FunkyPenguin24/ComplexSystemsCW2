[111816921375236316988,100451084021576146835,Dr Greene has operated on my shoulder for a bone spur on my rotator cuff and operated on me for a torn achilles tendon. Both operations went well. I think he is a fine physician. For one, he is conservative and not someone who will rush in to operate. Additionally, he is a good diagnostician. My wife had hip problems that were misdiagnosed by a number of other doctors but Dr Greene correctly found that she was having arthritis problems.]
