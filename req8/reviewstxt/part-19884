[101407540721432472683,100053716949803740605,I have been to many dealerships across Nashville and BY FAR the best service I received was at Crest Honda. From what I've heard, the service at Crest Honda is always exceptional and straightforward, but the sales rep that I lucked into was absolutely a joy to work with. His name was Ben Puryear, so ask for him when you call Crest or stop by to look at cars. He is genuine and honest, and he did not at all try to reason me out of what I came in there looking for (a hatchback manual in a particular shade of blue/gray, which as it turns out is kind of hard to find). Shopping for a car with someone you trust will make a WORLD of difference when you're like me and don't have prior experience in car buying and/or someone with experience to accompany you to the dealership.]
