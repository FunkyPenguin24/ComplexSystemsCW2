[105777204880054856092,100841292701249042187,It used to be a gud place for Rajisthani food, but the quality and service has been severely degraded these days. We visited here just a day ago, and food was absolutely tasteless. Worst off all, my friend got an insect (fly) from the khichdi he was served. When we complained to staff and called the mgr, first they just seemed ignorent..and offered to serve the thali again...!! Totally spoiled our mood that very fine day...]
