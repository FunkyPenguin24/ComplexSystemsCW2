[102075950258191074576,100562261556395138020,Just the other day a friend of mine took me here. The rolls are SSOO good! I honestly thought Panda Express was the best thing around but I am so wrong. The food is really fresh, plus it came to us in under 20 mins. Talk about fast! The only drawback is that its very small.]
