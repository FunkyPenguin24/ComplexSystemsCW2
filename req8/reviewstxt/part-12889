[102887200654754926554,100850978255078251749,We shop here every week, for tools, parts, supplies, and feed. The store saves us enormous amount of time, as opposed to driving into town, and the prices are reasonable and often lower than the big stores. Kevin Coe, the owner, is friendly and knowledgeable. He will special-order anything we need, and checks with customers about what stock to order for new seasons.]
