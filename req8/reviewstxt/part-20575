[102521242354848205642,100089702376620136330,We've had our sub zero fridge for several years now and it worked as planned but last week the freezer was just no getting cold enough anymore. And I noticed a break in the sealant tray. Made an appointment for these guys to come out. It did take a couple of hours but they got us fixed up properly. These sub z's can get expensive but wasn't too expensive.]
