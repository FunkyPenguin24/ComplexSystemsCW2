[105308577248357258936,100619527532921754165,I had Leaf and Limb come to my own home to remove a few trees, including a large one right up against my house, do some selective limbing and then grind out the stumps. I have a lot of time, energy and money invested in my landscaping and was impressed with their work. The left the job site clean and neat and were responsive to my concerns. I recommend them highly.]
