[109977185170834545638,100631840016986814455,5 stars for Russ Ali and everyone at West Houston Subaru. Russ was very knowledgeable about the car, did a great walk around showing me each and every feature and making sure my phone was connected before driving away. They beat my Credit Union rate, and made the process about as smooth as purchasing a car can be. I purchased a certified Passat, and I am greatly satisfied with the financial part of the deal, as well as the dealership, the salesman and the car itself. Kudos all around!]
