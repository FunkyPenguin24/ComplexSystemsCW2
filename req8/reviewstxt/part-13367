[108576284696948937964,100877177972866572496,Was very quiet for St Patricks Day but we were there early. The service was quick and the chicken and sweet potato salad I had was very nice although the chicken was a little too chargrilled in places. Overall a good experience with good food, ideal for a quick bite of lunch]
