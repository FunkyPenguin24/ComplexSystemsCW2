[108031136864195103318,100786313832361419127,Our son has been taking lessons from Stages for three years and has also attended three of their amazing rock workshops. His skill and confidence have grown tremendously! I highly recommend Stages for all your lesson, equipment, and rental needs. George, Pauli and the rest of the staff are very helpful and great to work with.]
