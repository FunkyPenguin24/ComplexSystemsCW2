[110319403333069080318,100664523078871064116,My third visit to the President's Quarters (hadn't been since 1992) was my attempt to introduce my northern sisters to the history, quaintness and beauty of Savannah. We were so pleased with the personalized breakfasts, friendly staff and, of course, your wonderful location - walking distance to EVERYTHING. Your rooms are such a nice departure from the everday hotel room that lacks imagination. We felt a true sense of being in historical surroundings. Thanks again.]
