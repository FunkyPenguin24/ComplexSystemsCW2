[109046075352507120764,100925870614618566011,From the moment we arrived we loved the place! From the amazing view of the bay from our Captain's Cabin with great privacy and use of a kitchen, to our endearing host, his family and doggies, we loved our stay! We were completely comfortable, enjoying the rocking chairs in our room as we gazed out onto the bay, and slept really well. The breakfast items were much appreciated, as well as access to bowls and utensils for ice cream we brought in to enjoy! Oggie and his family helped us with places to eat and wonderful places to visit. On his recommendation we drove up Mt. Erie to spectacular views of the islands. So fantastic! I cried when we left. I know we'll return to enjoy this completely unique and lovely experience. Thanks Oggie and your family!]
