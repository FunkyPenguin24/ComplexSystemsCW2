[107432134805081405534,100937001316178691010,Don't let the size of the store fool you - there is a lot to be had here! Just walking by the place, you are immediately put at ease by the wonderful aroma of whatever combination of incense has been burned that day wafting out the door. Stepping inside, it feels cozy. Friendly. Homey. The staff is courteous, knowledgeable, and will go out of their way to make sure you find what you are looking for - even if they don't have it, they can find it for you in the area, online, or order it in. Books, candles, incense, gemstones, athames, tarot decks, oils, you name it. Whether you're a student of Wicca, a practitioner of Vodou, are an herbalist that dabbles in rootwork, walk the Native American shamanic path, or you're just learning how to read tea leaves, this little shop has what you're looking for (and staff that knows what they're talking about!) - stop in for a "spell". :-)]
