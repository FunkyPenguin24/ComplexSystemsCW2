[104689021649934578695,100618132621043991716,I had some legal issues in Philadelphia when I moved from Los Angeles. I was new to the city and needed legal representation. My main concern was finding a lawyer who not only knew a lot about their field but was also one I can trust and depend on to have my best interest in mind. I was nervous at first, but after deciding to go with the lawyers at the Law Office of Douglas P. Earl I have absolutely no regrets. I had a successful outcome for my case and they were very dependable.]
