[106422165529505929356,101079539383955399084,This place is absolutely a great find! Easily in the same company as the very expensive spa's like the Ritz Carlton but at a fraction of the cost. The entire staff is very friendly and accommodating. I am a bit of a massage snob. I am very picky about quality. I have been at several high end spas over the years, but this one is my favorite by far. Karmalee is, without question, the best massage therapist I have had. I hate to mention her name because I may have difficulty in the future booking time with her. If you want a real deep tissue massage from someone that I consider to be the best - she is the one!]
