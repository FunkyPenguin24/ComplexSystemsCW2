[109659882715149337892,100492898958027599758,Great college. Awesome campus! The small size is perfect. They give each person individual attention. They really do give each student full attention and make you feel at home, here. They are extremely helpful and ensure that each student has the best experience with classes and everything. I'm doing all online classes and it helps so much with flexibility and is really nice. I am able to get help from the campus whenever needed, whether it be with classes, tutoring, financial or scheduling questions. They do it all and are great at their jobs! I definitely reccommend this college.]
