[102405644915695085854,101024137827333893267,Lennar advertises they have the 'everything's included home'. Man, is that FAR from true!!!!! No builder can possibly have everything that every single home owner wants. Their justification: 'we don't have a design center'. They say that helps them keep their costs competitive. Well, being a new, and sorry! Lennar home owner, I can tell you that things as simple as us wanting and willing to supply the paint - without a discount or credit - to have something other than the sterile white 'isn't allowed'!!!! All changes to make your home YOUR HOME, has to be done after market. This 'everything included home' is a sad and unfortunate JOKE!]
