[113562985618597200832,100573907405734859497,We just completed our second refinance with Quicken -- cutting our rate another half percent and reducing the length of our loan, with our monthly payment the same despite a huge tax increase that we are experiencing. Everyone we worked with at Quicken was friendly, clear and very helpful. Our loan process took about a month from initial contact to the loan being closed. The online application process worked very smoothly and it was easy to scan and upload PDFs of required documents. The website is very clear as to next steps and that helped to make the process go more smoothly. Our closing took place at our kitchen table after work and was very quick and relatively painless. I don't hesitate to recommend Quicken for those looking for a mortgage or for refinancing. Dave]
