[110003181012754237789,100627712656533647694,Visited the area for a week, and ended up visiting the restaurant 2x and ordering delivery 2x. The food is great! Portions are big and the food tastes fantastic. The staff is also super friendly. Also a great place to hang out on a sunday morning, eat their awesome AYCE brunch buffet, shoot some pool, and watch football. I will definitely miss this place.]
