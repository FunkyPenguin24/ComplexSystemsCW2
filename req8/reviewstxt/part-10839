[101302851779772252850,100738989000523643866,•Positives: We reserved a room online using Choice points, which was easy. Upon check-in for our one night stay, Ana informed my fiancé and I that she noticed we were Platinum members and upgraded our room to a suite at no extra cost. She was very friendly and welcoming. We were also informed that because of our membership, we could check out late (which apparently you need to be sure and specify you want, by the way). The lobby, elevators and our room were clean. Our king size bed was comfortable, too. •Negatives: When we got to the third floor, the hallway smelled like cigarette smoke when there were no-smoking signs posted all over. No, it's not in the best part of town, but both times we've stayed here, we've never felt unsafe. A day after checking out, we found a $50 charge on our credit card, which they said was just a hold and should have been canceled when we checked out, but wasn't until we called.]
