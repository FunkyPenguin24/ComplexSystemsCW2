[117142648252556219671,100079064032698599357,Food is fantastic and is HUGE! I can almost never finish the gigantic burritos and salads, but are always good for lunch or dinner the next day. The chips are made to order and are the best I've ever had and the guacamole and cheese dip are top-notch! The staff is usually busy, but are always prompt and courteous and get your food out to you quickly. I can't think of a better place to go for Mexican Cuisine and usually go more than once a week!]
