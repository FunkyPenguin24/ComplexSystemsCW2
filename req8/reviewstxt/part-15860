[110072800513757945694,101013529865712213631,Went for all you can eat King Crab legs. Have I had better King Crab ... yes, but this was very good. The bill with tip was not cheap, but well worth it. Our waiter, Brian, was awesome. Was attentive, never let our drinks get low, and made sure to have a steady stream of crab legs coming our way. Not once were we waiting on more until we couldn't eat anymore. I will be more than happy to try out Landry's again, even on a night that is not all-you-can-eat.]
