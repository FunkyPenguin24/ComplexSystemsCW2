[101558780715787530705,100333121194357739303,Very nice location, We stayed at Days Inn in Enterprise, Al and it wasn't this nice...The room could have been dusted better and things wiped off, But we got an upstairs room(that wasn't my choice) Because I have trouble w my legs and knees, So a little inconvience there. But the bed was made up so cute and a little lap desk left on the bed. The location is great, Close to the beach, Fast food places, and Pizza Hut in walking distance right in front of motel :) The light in the bathroom was real dim though and the exhaust fan was extremely loud, This is my first night here giving this review, I prob should have waited to discuss these few probs with the staff to see if they would fix everything. But overall you will sleep like a baby here. The bed is OMGAH sooooo Comfortable, I didn't wanna get up the next morning lol..:)]
