[112769598796761158407,100391757641039768976,World Market was one of the greatest stores in Mazza Gallerie! They had every household accessory, lots of fun, cute knick-knacks and activities, furniture, home goods, kitchen condiments, etc. It was one of the coolest and funnest experiences I have ever had.
