[106869337670871409956,100150668097843021496,I stayed for 2 nights in July. I can not say enough good things about the hotel. Views are fantastic, rooms are clean and up-to-date. But the staff are their hidden jewel. So many others at my conference were also commenting on the customer service. I was always greeted with a smile and never felt as if I was "bugging" them. All were complete professionals!]
