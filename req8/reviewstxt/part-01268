[113269453195173123117,100224315667041752890,I had the opposite experience at Freed Vet Hospital. I had a sick 8 year old beagle with severe diareha and my regular vet was out of town. I was able to bring a stool sample and with only examining that and an exam my dog was given some antibiotics. I was expecting blood draw ups and XRays at the least and appreciated the staff for only running the one test. The staff was friendly and Dr. Cain was compassionate and thorough.]
