[101861589563536123627,100892039543874903340,When the iphone 4 came out i lined up for hours, they opened late, and after they system went down they put it aside and said that they would activate it and that it was in stone that it would be mine and they wouldn't sell it. the sales rep malcolm sold it and lied outright to me. I should have known something was up, the sales rep beside was trying to sell an iphone case to a lady saying that if you don't buy the case your phone won't work. (word for word) I thought it was a pretty sleezy place. i wrote a big letter to the manager, who didn't do anything, and rogers. Thanks Google! now at least i can share my horrible experience.]
