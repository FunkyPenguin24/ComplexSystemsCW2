[116613199389502227959,100343106691063321842,Great Gatherings in Annapolis is a great place to shop and even to just browse with your family. Whenever we visit the store the staff is always welcoming and helpful, yet does not hover over you at all and allows you to just enjoy your visit without being haggled. We recently purchased a propane firepit and worked with sales associate Rick Wang. Rick was extremely helpful and informative. He provided all relevant details and pictures asked for by text message right away and worked with me on the price as well as making the delivery date convenient. Rick's direct feedback, recommendations on different products and information were the key factors to making the purchase.]
