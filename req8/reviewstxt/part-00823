[115930833159672601946,100201493742340404769,It has been a week since my windows got tinted at Glass Tiger, and I found nothing wrong with it. No dirt, particles, or fibers can be found underneath the foil. They even found a way to install the foil under the rear windowâ€™s taillight. That was impressive. The heat repelling foil is of outstanding quality and performance, and I did not even know something like that existed. They are a bit on the pricy side, far from unaffordable, but work of that quality should not be cheap. You buy cheap you buy twice. I definitely found my tint firm for life and have recommended them to many of my friends and coworkers. Taking everything into account I give them a solid five out of five.]
