[109536963056722199269,100161935371323889219,I had the Mexican wrap and my wife had "the best burger in NYC". Not impressed by the service, the waitress seemed to be friendly to everyone except us (maybe as we are Australians??). We are always very friendly towards hospitality staff as both of us used to work in the industry for many years so not sure what that was about. The bill was scribbled in unreadable handwriting and was about $10 more than I calculated it to be ($39.5 total) including the service charge. We weren't very impressed by the food, greasy and very basic for the price and setting. Wouldn't eat there again.]
