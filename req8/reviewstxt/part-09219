[100128425941043346112,100650722980727042627,Customer service manager at the Austin location was unwilling to partially move a vehicle so the customer could work on it after a very hard rain.The vehicle is under a good 2 to 4 inches of water. I was told it is not their policy to move vehicles for customers. regardless of that, all that had to be done was to pull it out of mud and water to be placed on the gravel surface. The long drive in (50+) miles was a COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT and had to leave because of the unwillingness of the employees to take care of a large paying customer. The potential sale of $300.00 plus dollars TOTALLY baffles me how on on a rainy day when there is no money to be made they could just let all that $$$ just walk right out the door. I'm sorry to say this will be the last time I use wrench a part for my restorations... If anyone from their management or ownership would like to contact me,... I would be willing to listen to their reasoning.]
