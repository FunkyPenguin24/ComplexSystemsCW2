[103325779395955014322,100598718607634368730,My issue is with the closing attorney at this location. Within 2 months of close, fraudulent behavior of the previous owners of my home came to light, mainly illegal receipts of work done and water/mold damage. I went to see John Sheehan and his partner, Mr. Senerchia. They referred me to a restoration business, told me to ask for a specific person and said they would write a letter to the previous owners, warning them that I would be filing a lawsuit if they didn't help out with the damages. I called the restoration business and a person came out to my home. He didn't even go into the attic, yet gave me an estimate of $18,500 to "remediate". I tried to file under homeowners insurance, but this technician told them that the problem was a poor roof install, and so it is not covered. Back to the attorneys...called repeatedly and could not get a return call. Several times in one day. Finally cried in frustration to the secretary and got a call back. He wanted to know "why I was mad at him?" I told him it had been weeks and I still have a leaking roof and no cooperation from the previous owners, and wondered where the letter was that he promised to send, and why hadn't he called me back? He said "I've been busy! I'm doing this as a favor to you!" I reminded him that they told me they would be charging me $300, and he said "no, I'm doing this as a favor! Plus I'm not even a litigation lawyer!" He said he would get a draft copy out to me ASAP and that he would call the AG office. "I will call you back, I promise!" were his last words to me, and that was 2 weeks ago. No call back, no draft copy, no emails. I have been dealing with a leaking roof for an entire month now and have gotten NO help. They are "too busy" to call me back, but were quick to do my closing. If you are looking for professionalism, look elsewhere.]
