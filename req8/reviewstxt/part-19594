[118280359758335091915,100038360625971244194,My wife and I were married just this July at the Views and it was a fantastic experience. From the initial planning meetings with Bruce to ironing out the last minute details the week preceding the event, everything was taken care of. The location is beautiful and thankfully the weather cooperated. We had a relatively small number of guests, about 75, but they were able to partition off the main room to just the right size. The food was fantastic and, even though we had to go around for pictures and to greet our guests, Bruce and the staff made sure that we had plenty. All night our guests were raving about how well put together the event was and how everything moved so smoothly. We couldn't be happier our experience at the venue.]
