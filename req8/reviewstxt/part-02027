[101195772754192983181,100263835544826090797,The food was awesome! Really good. The service down right pissed me off. If I wasn't on a date I would have gotten the management involved. I ordered the Diane, but since I'm on a low carb diet I asked to sub rice with broccoli. The server commented on how that was a good low starch option. I don't know who made the mistake (server or kitchen), but when my food came with broccoli and rice the server tried to make it seem like I didn't specify it as a substitution. I didn't say anything else because again I was on a date. This is obviously the server lying to cover the mistake because it was clear from previous conversation that he knew what I wanted. It was rude, dishonest, and condescending. I'll be back because the food was really good, but if I get the same sever I'll ask for a different one. He has red hair, a profound nose, and a beard.]
