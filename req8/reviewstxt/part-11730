[100385894652128971595,100786581786791687152,The staff is very helpful & fun! They have a great sense of humor, try to keep the atmosphere safe & professional. Despite a dicey customer base, the items available are quality & they offer returns under certain conditions. They have been in the Temecula/ Murrieta area for well over 15 years, and have never done wrong by me.]
