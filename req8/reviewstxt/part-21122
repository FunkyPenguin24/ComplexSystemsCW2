[115619614473873992169,100119540790194975474,he staff here are awesome! My son and his girlfriend were staying here while in Oslo. It was my son's birthday and I wanted to surprise him with a gift basket which was a bit of a challenge being that I was home in the United States! Ronny Wilhem, who is the front office manager, went to a nearby shop and purchased chocolate and made a wonderful 'gift' for me. It was a wonderful surprise! You can't possibly receive better 'care' and customer service than this! Ronny, you are such an asset to the Hotel Bondeheimen! Our son and his gf loved staying at this hotel! Fabulous accommodations, warm & friendly staff and right in the middle of so much to see and do!]
