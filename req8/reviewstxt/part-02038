[106807749891198417344,100264391039024533267,I was sat down and promptly greeted by my server. She took excellent care of me. They have this jalapeno cheese sauce that is brought out with the chips and salsa. This sauce is addicting! I had the vegetable enchiladas with the rice and beans. Very tasty. I loved the green sauce as opposed to the red sauce usually on enchiladas. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the house made flan. The "caramelized sauce" was nothing more than simple syrup poured over an overbaked custard, then topped with canned whipped cream. Otherwise, very good service, fun atmosphere, and overall, very good food. I'll definately be back.]
