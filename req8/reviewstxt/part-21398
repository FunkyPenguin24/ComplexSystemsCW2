[103570742536306555069,100134844037047235258,I love Dr. Bedoya and her staff <3. I got my braces as an adult and I have loved the work that she is doing. I Iove to smile now and they are not even off yet! My youngest daughter just got her braces put on and we are both excited about seeing the finished job. Thank you Dr. Smiles. You are the ONLY orthodontic we refer people to. That says a lot since my other 3 kids have had braces to by other orthodontics here in town.]
