[102791975690418399097,100399399442805093669,Like the previous reviews mentioned, the service could use some help - limited English, sometimes outright rude. Regarding the half price sushi, the wait can be very long & it's mostly fillers & sauce - you don't get too much fish (slices of tuna were paper thin), they're cutting corners here. But hey, you get what you pay for.]
