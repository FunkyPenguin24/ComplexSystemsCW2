[112692132354696574854,100411654361460354580,The decor is bland, the service is poor, the atmosphere is similar to that of a group home cafeteria. The food was ok (their burgers & nachos), so i decided i would call to order food (since they do advertise that they deliver and i refuse to step foot in the horrid place). However... when i dialed their phone number it immediately ends the phone call, i thought maybe i entered the number incorrectly, turns out i did not. These guys have a lot to fix & fast before they can even consider themselves a "SOMEWHAT OK" restaurant.]
