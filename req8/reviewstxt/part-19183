[114206939322327783656,100015629062952980247,We were in Vancouver for vacation. My wife forgot bring her sunglasses and one of our friends suggested Rumi Optical in downtown Vancouver. The owner seemed very well-informed and very experienced with optics, he gave us very good deal. He was very kind with a nice attitude. I didn't need to buy for myself, but since I liked the way that he treated us, and then I decided to buy another one for mine too. We both were very happy from our shopping and the money that we spent because both sunglasses were original brands, with reasonable prices and very good quality. Bruce from Ontario]
