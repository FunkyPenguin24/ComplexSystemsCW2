[107539648772354579871,100149584893181691649,The first time we went to Red Rocks Country Club we absolutely loved it. The course is beautiful and challenging. We joined two years ago and decided after six months to move into the neighborhood and could not be happier. It is a unique community tucked in the foothills. Close to everything but you feel like you are in a mountain resort. We ride our golf cart to the club which is one of the only courses in town that allows your own golf cart. The club has fun events for the members including happy hour on Friday's in the summer by the pool with bands. We've met many great friends since we joined Red Rocks and look forward to the social and golf events during the year. I see many communities since I'm a Realtor but decided on Red Rocks and the Willow Springs area because it is a truly great community and golf course!]
