[103238863845136059216,100359787920989593340,I've been practicing yoga for the past two years now and my family just recently moved to OKC. subsequently I went and tried a new studio and this is one I picked. After all my experiences at several studios around Austin, Texas i'm going to be flat out honest and say that my experience at the studio was very poor. Yoga, an experience that should be very welcoming and friendly seemed very local and the instructor was, in my opinion, very neglectful towards her duties in making me feel welcome. Upon arrival I received a feeling that I have never felt when going to yoga and this feeling continued as our instructor demanded poses, didn't explain transitions, and had the music too loud to where I could barely even hear her. Im not usually the one to rag on a certain studio but after my experience here I told my self I would never return. Partly because of the instructors attitude, and the fact that she was on her phone majority of my time in the studio, and upon leaving and saying thank you I was completely ignored. Yoga is about new experiences, cleansing, friendly, and welcoming surroundings and I did not feel that at soul yoga. I would recommend a different studio, granted they are fairly new studio I would give them room for improvement, which is why I took my time in writing this review.]
