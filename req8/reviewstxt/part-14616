You need to tell the dude that sits outside the concert venues who seems to know everything and explains it all at the top of his lungs to shut the hell up. The facilities are immaculate, albeit a tad stuffy, ideal for theater performance or low key music performance. This is not a venue for full out band performances. The rigid seating charts drastically takes away from the live music experience.]
