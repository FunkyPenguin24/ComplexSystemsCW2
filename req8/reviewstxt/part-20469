[104826231759005561937,100084563209355408461,I went there recently with a groupon I purchased. I havent been there in several months due to the consist management changes....no one could seem to get there SH$%^ together...but I find a groupon and thought I would give them another chance. To say the least, I was ONCE again disappointed. I was told they would NOT accept the groupon. The girl was curt, and rude, saying I can use it at the Pompano store. When it CLEARLY states on it for the coral springs store! I explained to her that I purchased it for this store, because I lived less than 2 miles away. She didnt seem to care. Nor did she even offer anything in exchange for making it up...EX: A small discount of some sort... A purchase with maybe a free one......NOTHING! POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!! I own my own retail store, and I would have gladly at least "Tried" to make it up to the customer! Well, I drove over to their competitor and "They" took the groupon! Needless to say, I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO BOCA TANNING! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!]
