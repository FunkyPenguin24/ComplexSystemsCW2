[105538268565669339123,100527522092247740162,This is a beautiful venue, but the customer service is pathetic. My family got a lane and we were completely ignored by the waiter. So, we went to get our own drinks. We all wanted food badly and the waiter continued to ignore us. I flagged down the manager who apologized. He said he would give us a complimentary "Loaded Fry" entree, it never came. On the way out, the manager apologized one more time, and I said, "It's ok, I understand". Another family member said, "No it's not ok", and he continued to blast the manager about the lack of service. The upper manager said to my family member, "Your're Intoxicated"... Well in any case, I wasn't intoxicated, and there is no doubt that the management here leaves something to be desired. It is evident when you walk into this location that nobody cares. It's quite sad because the place is beautiful. I would love to return, but I don't think I can after this. I've been to plenty of bowling alley's in our area where the customer service is really great. These managers need more training, or else the staff is poorly paid... I'm not sure, but something isn't right.]
