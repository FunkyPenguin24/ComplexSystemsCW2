[105204597344392766511,101168445115872018868,I just ordered an Italian beef and its gross. I hate the way it smells and the way it taste. Whatever season they used on it sucks plus the texture of the meat is off. But the ribs are great catfish too. But they need to hire someone else to answer the phone cause dude is rude as hell, no exactly what you want b4 you call cause he will hang up on you. Plus don't ask to many question.]
