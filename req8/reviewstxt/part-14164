They told me a story about how I needed $690 of work because "both sides need to be replaced" and "if we do that, we gotta do this too". I took it to Mark at The Car Doc in Mundelein, and (even though he knew the story) fixed it for $64. For all I know, what he fixed, Duxler broke so they could have a way to feed my their bull.]
