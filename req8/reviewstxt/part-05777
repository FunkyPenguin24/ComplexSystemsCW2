[104780091818628909618,100465608810588795960,The service was so bad I almost don't care that our food was overall very good. Our waiter was horrendous. As soon as we ordered sodas and water to drink he treated us like crap. We got a single drink refill (no exaggeration, one single refill) the entire night, our food was served by wait staff with our waiter refilling the wine glasses and laughing at the next table. His name was Miguel, just so I don't insult any of the other staff, and it was one of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had. It was also my birthday, so that was just dandy.]
