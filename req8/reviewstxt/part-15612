[115755523471424852293,101000477079722950664,The coffee is sooooooo good. It's in the top 4 cafes I have tried, so it shares company with Seven Seeds, The Naked Espresso and Brother Bubba Budan. It has become a weekly ritual for me to visit Axil for a coffee and a bag of beans to use thoughout the week. Their beans are expensive, ranging from $12 to $20 per 250 gram bag, but it really does reflect in the quality. I've tried buying freshly roasted beans elsewhere for much cheaper prices, but I don't enjoy coffee anywhere near as much. Staff are wonderful, they're helpful and happy to chat about the coffee blends and brewing methods.]
