[104915591416680914178,100702387566087689485,I've eaten lunch here for two years, and everything has been hot and delicious. Their cream cheese won-tons are awesome, and they tuck one into every lunch combo. If you like it spicy, just ask and they'll add a fiery kick to whatever. Today I had spicy broccoli beef, and it was excellent as usual :)]
