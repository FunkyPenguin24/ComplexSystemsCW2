[108051960186706175464,100608648418665168838,My wife and I stayed here for our anniversary. I called in my reservation and had advised the person that we would be in town to calibrate. I asked for a view of the river walk and I was advised no problem. When we arrived I was advised that our room had been upgraded at no cost to a room with a terrace with the river. We went for a walk and when we returned to our room we were given a bottle of wine and some fresh strawberry. This hotel works hard to make sure your stay in great. The staff was friendly. The hotel was very clean. The food at the 5:30 kick back was good the free drinks where even better. The hot breakfast was also good. They are also military friendly as well. From this point forward I will only stay at Drury if it is an option.]
