[106121941718011355597,100452787723863444058,Dan has been repairing my Volvo for close to 10years. He has been able to help me talk to Volvo corporate when there is a warranty or recall issue and has secured parts for me quickly and at reasonable cost. I can call or stop by anytime and he and his crew are there to help if I have a quick question or problem. When I was considering selling my Volvo, instead of making money on all the continued repairs, he was honest and said i should move on, helping me select my next vehicle. It is all about service at High Line..I wouldn't go anywhere else..!]
