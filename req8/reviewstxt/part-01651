[113694057404101276985,100244435555842086446,Being new to an area, it's always nerve wracking trying to find a new daycare for Nala. Once I got settled and moved into the Warehouse district, we tried out MetroDogs and it was love at first sight! The staff is always really friendly and the facility itself is really clean and bright. It's also nice to know that they offer a true full service - everything from daycare, boarding, grooming, and one-on-one attention. It's no secret that Nala is obsessed with playing fetch - so it's nice to know that the staff there recognizes this, embraces it, and throws a never ending ball! On mornings that she goes to MetroDogs - she practically pulls my arm off to get there - we won't be going anywhere else as long as we live in Minneapolis! Thank you to Amy and staff for opening a wonderful place for Nala.]
