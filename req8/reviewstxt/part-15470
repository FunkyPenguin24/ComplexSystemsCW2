[113266008341881575080,100991987891050853210,My wife and I recently purchased a new Subaru Outback and were exceptionally pleased with the entire buying process at Reliable Subaru. Our sales rep Dennon was super to work with, and really knows his product. The negotiating process was very quick and fair, and we are very happy with the fact that we got a terrific deal without any stress or drama! The financing process with Mike was also a great experience. We were approved through the bank at a crazy low 1.7%, but Reliable Subaru beat that by almost half, 0.9%! I know that most people will tell everyone when they have a problem, but forget to tell anyone when they have a great experience, so I wanted to be sure to post here what an extremely satisfying experience we had, and highly recommend them to anyone looking to get into a new ride. Thank you, Brian]
