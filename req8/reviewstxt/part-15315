[109177172571935504497,100983288476596724760,I feel like there's a stronger orientation (and success rate) at Sports Reaction Center to getting an athlete back in the game than at other physical therapists. For example, I called one afternoon after having seen two doctors earlier in the week for a burning pain above my ankle that was getting worse every time I ran. I had my first triathlon of the season coming up in 4 weeks and it looked like best case I'd have to shuffle through the run, and more likely, wouldn't be able to compete at all. The SRC team found a time for me the next day, and within four weeks of working with Dr Laura Mickelson the pain was gone -- and I ran a faster run split than the year before on the same course! I've continued to work with SRC, they've continued to keep me racing. I highly recommend Sports Reaction Center.]
