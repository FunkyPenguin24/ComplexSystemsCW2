[112176799972564482682,100269693329283602448,I will never go back to this place again. I loved the washers. The dryers took for ever to dry. When I needed to break a bill to add more money to my card, I was told I had to buy something. I had already spent $30.00 and obviously going to spend more but got told this crap. so I walked out with half of my clothes wet. I'm really sorry Justin was such a jerk and lost the company a customer. I'm hoping more after this post!]
