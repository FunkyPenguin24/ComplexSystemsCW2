[108904263642185775840,100577350438224882010,Had Sunday lunch which was £15 a head. I thought this was quite expensive for Sunday Lunch but was happy to pay it because of the good reviews the pub had. when the food arrived it was stone cold. When we told the waitress she pulled a face and looked at us like we were mad. She took the food away without an apology or explanation. Waited ages for our replacements and when they finally came I was given lamb instead of beef. I informed the waitress but said I would eat it anyway but wanted a refund for the price difference. I never got it and couldn’t be bothered making a fuss over £2. The food is left on the pass for collection with all the empty glasses and ignored by the waitresses who both looked like they really didn’t want to be at work. The tables were very dirty and weren’t cleaned the whole time we were there. To be fair the food was very nice but totally spoiled by the service and grubby surroundings. Won’t be going back for seconds.]
