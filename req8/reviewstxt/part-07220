[101567786851917048409,100544101269705724982,After having a great hair color at Rodolfo Valentin Salon last week I went down stairs to have lunch at Nello. I always wanted to have time to spend there because when I go to the salon I see beautiful people having lunch there but most of them are acting like being in a showcase so I also wanted to share the stage. I had a good time while there chatting with the waiters, also the owner Nello stop by to say hello. The food is good Italian food, nothing superb but no bad at all. Decor is based in fresh flowers which make the place look very nice and the service is very friendly. Prices are high but worth the tab to watch beautiful people and show my beautiful hair around.]
