[105457452579603485704,100341167088042158634,I get a friendly greeting every time I walk in the door, and I usually get a "have a nice day" when I leave. One of the staff members has even gotten to know my name--and I'm not that consistent in going. It's a bit hot inside, but I suppose that makes me sweat more, and they're saving energy. There are definitely some space issues associated with the new construction, but I think they are juggling it fabulously. I can't wait for the completed new Y. I think they take feedback seriously here too. I expressed a desire to see evening aquatics classes since there weren't really any in the spring, and this summer there are a ton of evening options. I'm totally hooked on this Y.]
