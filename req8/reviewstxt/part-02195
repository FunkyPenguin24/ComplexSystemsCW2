[114548031897745518860,100272218444486207455,I didn't feel like I was pushed into anything. I was able to test drive the cars I wanted, even the ones I couldn't afford. I got in and out several times, front and back and found the Elantra I wanted. It literally just came off the truck. Financing is never fun but it wasn't painful either. I am thrilled with the car.]
