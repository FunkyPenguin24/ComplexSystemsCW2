[104465152000126341330,100920031969047729546,Wow - what a great find! Emmanuelle (the owner / proprietor of the hotel) and her staff were amazingly helpful with accommodating our specific needs for a larger room since we were traveling with our daughter and our dog. We loved the breakfast spread and the beautiful terrace. It's located just off the main tourist area and so it's conveniently quiet even with windows open. Europe + summer = need air conditioning!! The rooms are equipped with a noiseless A/C unit, which made it very comfortable. The hotel parking lot is a real deal for Euro10/day, and well worth it if you're traveling with family. The only thing we could have done with was a mini-bar / fridge in the room to house our daughter's milk. We were also (perhaps unreasonably) hoping for some local toiletries from Provence, seeing that they are so famous globally, which we could also perhaps have had the option to buy (and possibly be another revenue stream for the hotel). We look forward to going back there soon!]
