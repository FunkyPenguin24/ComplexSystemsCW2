[103887831208516808405,100108205894435474788,I underwent Coolsculpting and I love the results. I am 50ish, post menopausal and have accumulated fat in areas where it will not decrease with eating healthy, running, weight lifting and various other exercise. At this point, I have had four procedures in two separate sessions with the help of Lisa who guided me through the pre-treatments, treatments and post-treatments. She prepared me well for what would occur afterward. I experienced tenderness, a little swelling, no bruising and some cramping, but was given a prescription that helped elminate most of those issues. I also wore the compression garment religiously and felt less of the after effects because of that. Four months after Coolsculpting my upper and lower abdomen - I am thrilled with the results. I nearly have a flat abdomen. I admit that I cheated at the gym due to work/other commitments and eating all the wrong things during stressful times, but still obtained fantastic results. I recently returned for a second session, having my lower abdomen (a second time) and my love handles Coolsculpted. It was a brreeze. No swelling, brusing and very little tenderness. I am excited see the changes I undergo in the next few months. I also attended an open house at BWS and purchased the best mineral makeup I've ever used. And, I won a gift certficate for a Coolsculpting. So, I highly recommend that you visit the open houses at the spa...meet the staff...take advantage of all the wonderful services they offer during that event...and enjoy the results you'll achieve like me.]
