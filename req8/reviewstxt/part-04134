[107525814616134462383,100377493270775536948,After hearing so many positive reviews about CyberpowerPC, I finally decided to give them a try when it came time to purchase my new laptop. The experience has been nothing short of incredible. The site was easy to navigate and I was able to customize my laptop of choice with the parts I wanted (within their options for the model). I was able to choose the parts that I deemed important, graphics card, primary/secondary HDD, RAM, and even the OS. One great thing as well was their low cost when compared to the competition. The system they built for me is just as powerful, if not more so than others in the same class, but the cost was much lower. More bang for your buck as the saying goes. Once I placed the order, their customer service took over and was truly impressive. I received emails every single step of the way, from confirmation of order, to the build in progress, to quality control, and finally to your order has shipped. This may sound simple enough, but not many companies follow up this often on a one to one basis, and I found this to be a great benefit. And when I did have questions, they were immediately available over the phone and replied to emails almost immediately. And now that I have the laptop, I can honestly say that it rounds out a perfect customer experience. The laptop runs great, and for what is under the hood, it stays impressively cool. And there was no bloatware. They only installed the OS and what was essential such as drivers and basic user settings. I was able to use it right out of the box without issue. I would highly recommend CyberpowerPC to anybody looking for a powerful laptop whether it's for photo processing, video editing, or hardcore gaming. I'll definitely turn to them again for my computer purchase.]
