[117057140424270003330,100073469561974410653,When I left New York City in 1989, I thought I was leaving the world's best pizza behind. Now, a few years later, I've got it in my own back yard! It's all in the name - Crust! The crust is thin, light, crispy and delicious from the center out to the edge. The toppings are fresh and taste that way. The dining room is great for the whole family (it is so nice to have a place to bring the kids and let them act like kids). Service is friendly and professional. This is how pizza should be - fresh and handmade. Try it once and you'll never go back to those big chains. I'll see you there for the Monday night special!]
