[103110384453726619549,100383732754277248084,The only good thing about this place is the crust. Best I've ever had. It's sad that everything else was so terrible. We waited 15 minutes after sitting down before being asked what we wanted to drink. The pizzas (2) took slightly longer than I would expect but not long enough to complain about. Upon receiving them I immediately noticed there was way too much cheese. They attempted to cut through it's inch thick layer of cheese but were unsuccessful and I had to do it. The toppings were unevenly distributed and the black olives and cheese were all I could taste. When I did occasionally taste another topping, it was amazing. The glasses are small and I ran out of water fast and had to flag down the waitress to get more since she was busy chatting it up with another table the whole time. Overall terrible experience and I should have just gone to Pizza Hut. I won't be going back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.]
