[100316105162546630387,100236722254623072645,We took our Ridgeback and our Boxer here. We stayed in touch the whole week and heard nothing but the dogs were doing well and there are no issues. I brought cash to pay the bill when picking up the dogs and I brought the exact amount. When I got there she told me the boxer was playing with her and nicked her with a tooth so I had to pay a $25 fee. With the new fee I didn't have enough cash. I tried to make arrangemnts but she would only keep the dogs another day or I could get cash, she would not release my dogs. When I asked her to stay a little late so I could go get cash she refused and offered to keep my dogs another day. I had all the agreed on cash and she wouldn't release my dogs. I was lucky enough to get to an atm and back in time. I told her what I thought about this extortion and she then said I was lucky she didn't call the cops and have my dogs taken and put in isolation. My fiancce called and then she threatened to sue us for what changed from a nick with a tooth to now our dog attacked her, when of course we heard nothing of this the whole week calling every day. Boxers are very hyper and jump alot, when the dog was jumping she said she would walk in the corner and turn her back, that is silly, especially if you later want to say you are attacked, why would you put yourself in a corner with your back to a dog you are "fearful" of? Just beware, if you ever have a problem she will change her story to fit her version of the truth.]
