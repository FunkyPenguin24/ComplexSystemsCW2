[101561269866526933377,100656892470131440721,The service is horrible, for one. I waited and I waited and I waited for about ten minutes to be seated. I finally asked the lead waiter if I could have a seat and he acted as though I ruined his life just for making the request. Extremely rude. Not to mention one of their waiters copied my check card number and tried to defraud me of $1300.00 the NEXT day. Fortunately, my bank was on top of it and I filed charges (also called the manager as well). Don't eat here. It was the worst experience I've ever had in a restaurant, ever.]
