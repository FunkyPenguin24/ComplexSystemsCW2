[102446517913377174424,100510761701950129597,We have been staying here every May and October for over 20 years and would never go elsewhere. Accommodations could not be better. It is quiet, private, immaculately clean, owner friendly and a 10 minute walk to our seats at the track. There is on site management at all times. They will park you and set you up if necessary. Sites are very spacious and most are drive through. If it rains no one is sitting in water or mud. Security is top notch. The owner, Phillip, stops by daily just to see if we need anything. Race day is even peaceful. I can't see where it could get any better than this.]
