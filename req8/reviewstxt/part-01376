[105566392159505587745,100230129732471654807,My most recent buying experience through Elaine Zhu at Heninger Toyota is the most pleasing. First of all, I was always treated courteously during my repeated phone calls / visits. All questions answered politely and patiently. Secondly, I was surprised by how much a lady knows about a Tundra! Thirdly, she helped me to make all the right choices about the (sometimes-too-many) options. Finance was made easy. Most importantly, I bought the right truck and enjoy driving it every minute! Thank you so much Elaine and Heninger Toyota!]
