[103062282875446939445,100181181793714756815,I have refrained from rating this newly renovated facility in Clearwater until I attended several events. But it is what it is. Granted the old theater was beyond worn out and as seedy on the inside as it was on the outside. Well now it is new, bright, and shiny. That's where it stops. They have packed way too much in way too little of space. From the moment you gain access to the inadequate lobby, to the pouring out of the exit after the show you will experience, narrow isles to the restrooms, a stage that is at least 2 feet too low, and sardine like seats that are both way too skinny and with legroom fit for Airtran. The slope of the floor is inadequate and the seats are not offset so if you are unlucky enough to sit behind a 6 footer, you will not see what you bought a ticket to see. The box seats are just plain old silly and the decor is discontinued K-Mart. I have three more shows for which I have purchased tickets. I will go for the same reason I attended show in the pre-renovation era. The consumer public deserved better. What a wasted opportunity.]
