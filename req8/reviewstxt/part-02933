[108552165117002587434,100310606210091653947,I am giving 2 stars purely because the staff was indeed nice, however, I will give you some very insightful info on the CHARGES. I took my son here because he cut his finger. I really just wanted to make sure it wasn't infected and this place was close to my house (in a strip mall). They were very nice, put a bandaid on his finger and said it would be fine. Paid $100 up front. Fast-forward a month and I get a bill for $2,100 from FCER. I don't know about you, but I know what a bandaid cost and I know we were there a total of 15 minutes and I know not even lawyers charge $8,000/hr so to me this was robbery. I understand a nurse looked at it and said it was ok and I am willing to pay for that, but $2,100?! Maybe the rest of you think I am being silly, but I never expected that even if I had gone to a hospital ER. They charge a fortune, so if you need non-life threatening care go elsewhere if at all possible. I would have hated to see what it would cost if they had to do anything at all.]
