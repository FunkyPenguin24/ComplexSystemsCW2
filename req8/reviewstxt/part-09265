[104439783936085248969,100653290449259264056,You know when you have to wait for about an hour for breakfast it must be good food. This place is well worth the wait. With everyone's taste buds taken care of and reasonable prices. This is a place that became a regular for us after the first bite into my Cajun Eggs Benedict. Try them if you like the heat and you will not be disapointed.]
