[107680502699557228858,100349534322818225652,I've been coming into Fujiya for many years now. I love the food and the people here. They're always corteous and the food is always good. If you're sitting at the bar Juan is always willing to to engage you in banter as he produces awesome works of art. I especially recommend the Jalepeno Nigiri, even if you don't like spicy things. It's worth it and I unless you're even more of a heat wimp than me you'll survive it :D]
