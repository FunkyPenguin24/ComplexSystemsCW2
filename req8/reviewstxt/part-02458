[100621707782886398313,100285745844473698747,I stayed at the hotel from 10th August 2012 for 2 nights, the beach facing hut with a private lawn was superb. The hotel has a good restaurant but the cheff needs to learn a lot by putting taste into the well presented dishes. A perfect place to stay with your family and the kids are going to love it.]
