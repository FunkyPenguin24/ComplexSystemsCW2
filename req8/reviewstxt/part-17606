[102965568695452466657,101108911064572328656,Bluewater Cafe is our favourite local regular restaurant. Our daughter loves playing in the children's wonderland at the back and we love the breathtaking views and lovely food. Horses roam the meadow in front, peacocks cry and strut their amazing fan tails, and across the wetland we can see the turquoise blue surf of Noordhoek beach beneath Chapman's Peak. If the weather is calm, it is heavenly, but equally a challenge when the south-easter blows hard. We all agree that the Bluewater pizzas are some of the best we have ever had - anywhere. We also have severe allergies and food intolerances in our family, and this restaurant has become a firm favorite within our circle of safety. The owner as well as the staff have really made an effort to make our meals there an enjoyable and stress free experience - to the extent that they now have a dedicated pizza recipe (not on the menu) referred to under my wife's name. The only thing to be aware of is that service can be very slow at times, and they are closed all day Monday and half of Tuesday. Also, if you do not enjoy children, peacocks and chickens running freely around your dinner table, you should choose to dine inside.]
