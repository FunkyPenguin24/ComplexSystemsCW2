[104088240906267940140,100289211772717717412,I highly recommend Vienna Dental Associates. They are great. The staff is friendly and the dentists are top notch. Last year I had to have an emergency procedure and they got me in the next day! The office is pretty up to date. They have monitors that show what is going on, and you are able to view your x-rays up close. Everything is explained to you before it occurs. Dustin is my Dentist, and he is beyond approachable. We talk casually as if I have been a patient for years. I felt comfortable from the moment I walked into the office. I will continue to go back here, and recommend this practice over others I have been to in the past.]
