My son, who is a two-time Florida All-State Jazz saxophonist, told me that much of what he learned that accelerated his ability to play he learned at Interlochen, which is all the more impressive as he was able to also attend a summer workshop put on by Juilliard each year. Yes, there are uniforms and yes, they're horribly old school, belt buckles and all, but the camp brings together amazing artists and gives them a beautiful place to spend the summer, create, hang and meet other top artists their age from around the world. The oldest summer arts camp also is a great scouting location for midwestern colleges and great lakes schools like Michigan who look there for talent.]
