[100020508040582229297,100184983758906165204,I am not a vegetarian but after eating at this restaurant I might switch. Why you ask? Because it wasn't until after I finished eating that I found out it was a vegetarian restaurant and the chicken I ate was actually delicious healthy tofu. If all vegetarian food was like this place, our fields would be overrun with cows.]
