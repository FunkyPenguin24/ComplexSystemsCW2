[112267552655521567679,101138169872164937421,Great people in the sales, service (Bill B is a stand-up guy) and parts departments. They're always attentive, professional and helpful. Not 100% sold on the value of service work, however: Could be no one's ever happy to pay for repairs, but seems I've paid top dollar for good-but-not-great results. (Feels like 99th percentile prices for 80th percentile work; maybe that's just the way it is when you have to open your wallet?) I will say this, though: For a well-engineered car like a VW, skilled technicians and genuine parts are a must ... and at the dealer I know that's what I'll get.]
