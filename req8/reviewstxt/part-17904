[100256627377920484146,101123979026440143082,Selling my used MacBook Pro was a painless and simple procedure. I described my laptop and its condition and received a conditional price from SYM, which I believe was a fair price. After sending pictures of my computer, the original quote was further confirmed. Using the prepaid shipping label, I sent my MacBook off to SYM. In one week and four days, with an intervening three-day weekend, I had check in hand. I will use these people again!]
