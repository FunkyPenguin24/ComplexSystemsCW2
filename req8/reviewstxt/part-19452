[104213243236273025446,100030101566734942362,Thank you to Doctor Ram and staff for the friendly and professional treatment my son and I received when we went for our medicals for immigration purposes. My son has an abject phobia about needles and I was terrified that he would not allow the doctor to draw blood or give him his vaccinations. It took immense patience (he was there a couple of hours) but the job was done and we are overjoyed. I'm very grateful for the ease with which the examination is conducted. No fuss, no stress and you're out of there. Thanks again.]
