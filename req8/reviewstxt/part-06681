[106603047614573949745,100515491497320174931,The service at the Avon store was outstanding. Every employee we encountered was very helpful and polite, esp. our salesperson. I bought a large bookcase and the cost was $399. When it arrived, there were some nicks, some uneven stain, a couple of things coming apart. I phoned customer service and they sent a technician out the same day. He fixed everything that was wrong, and now the case looks great. I am very pleased with the service I received and highly recommend Jordan's Furniture.]
