[104246755987041722856,100274847171458248389,The food was very aromatic and flavorful. It is a nice quaint and small family owned restaurant with excellent food. It was me and my family first time eating there and we all loves it. My 2 daughters who are 9 and 10 years enjoyed it. You can tell that the food was fresh and cooked with care]
