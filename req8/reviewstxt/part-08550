[110690436776805193094,100615866327590858048,This is the second year in a row we have had Sarah's Pony Rides come out to our Rett Syndrome Association of Illinois annual picnic. They arrive ahead of time and do a great job working with our kids and young adults with Rett Syndrome. We are going to have them come back again in 2014. Everyone loves the staff and the pony rides. I highly recommend them.]
