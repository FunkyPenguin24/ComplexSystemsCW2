[110819917924989696719,100704760390278435414,Me and my friends had booked in the restaurant for one of our birthday celebrations; but on arrival we were told we hadn't booked in even though we had. The person on reception was extremeley rude and was very arrogant to say the least. There was a very large congregation of women in the restaurant due to the England game on the Friday, so we have a feeling they turned away our custom to accomodate the said women. Having come from Stoke-on-Trent purposely for the meal it was safe to stay we were very angry and disappointed by the way we were treated, luckily we managed to get in at The Crown of India up the road which was fantastic. Safe to say we will never attempt to come here ever again, nor would we recommend anyone to go here, but I would recommend the Indian restuarant...]
