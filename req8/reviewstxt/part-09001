[115956579246370650825,100638352319454251483,I have used this hotel for the past several months to host a business luncheon. The staff has been so kind and helpful. They confirmed in advance what I needed and made sure I was satisfied with my arrangements. I am very pleased with the service they have provided. It's a shame that hotel has a handful of negative reviews because it seems only complainers take time to comment. I am glad I took a moment. Willis Blake, the manager, is doing a great job there and I'll be back.]
