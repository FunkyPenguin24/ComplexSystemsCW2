[114993989410108699312,100037855278696957747,I have received nothing but amazing service from the folks at Goldstream Cycle. When I approached them to help me achieve and prepare for a very special ride that I will be taking part in June of 2013 there wasn't a hesitation. The owner personally made sure that not only did I get the proper bike, but was well fitted to suit my needs. I am not a cyclist by any means. But the guys and gal have shown me nothing but support and encouragement and have not steered me wrong on everything I need. Neither did it hurt the pocket book either. I highly recommend this store for all cycling needs!]
