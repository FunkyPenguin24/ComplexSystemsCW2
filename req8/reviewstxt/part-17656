[117366286075331297494,101111800199873995836,I lived in on of their apartments for 2 years in Warrenton OR. They will take every dime they can get from you legal or not, & still not put any money back into the property. In a 36 unit complex we had 5 washers & 5 dryers, most of the time only 2 of each worked they would spend hundreds of dollars in repairs, but never replace them. I am also a local contracor who also did work for this company & they are ALWAYS late with their payment. I was never late with my rent, but there policy is if your 2 or 3 days late they hit you with a notice & $45 late fee. Bottom line, if you can stay clear of them it will be in your best interest.]
