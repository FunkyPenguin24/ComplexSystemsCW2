[102324970443332912656,100805953662659025711,I recently stopped by here to check out their selection of craft beers. The store part had a decent collection of different brews from around the area and the country. I popped in to the restaurant and was a little disappointed with their selection of beers on tap. I didn't see any great micros but I ended up with a Killian's and can't complain. The chicken cheesesteak was very large and came with a pickle and chips at a very affordable place. I would definitely recommend this for a quick stop and grab in the middle of the day. Everyone was friendly and the Phillies game was on. Perfect.]
