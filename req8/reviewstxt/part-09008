[115091212849047901233,100638584078450040999,I've sampled most of the bigger Gyms in Seattle and like this one (and it's other Seattle area affiliates) best because of the vibe. Yeah the staff are friendly. but so are the other customers who seem to be there to work out, not hang around to see if anyone they know shows up, or sit on machines to socialize or read. Having plenty of equipment probably helps. There's plenty of parking, lockers, etc. It's not as cold as some gyms or hot & humid as others--it's like they figured out some kind of machine that maintains the temperature and circulation or something! I haven't experienced any of the billing problems other people mentioned, and I've stopped and started 3 times.]
