[117383998389592525872,100004839130404210728,John Busillo does not value customers. The 1998 Chevy Malibu he sold me turned out to have two tires that are the wrong size for the vehicle. Also, front brake rotors were completely rusted on the back side. I paid for the brakes, but couldn't afford correct tires for vehicle. So, in total, I paid 3600 dollars for the car. I called John asking if he could help in any way and all he told me is "You can't come up with another two hundred dollars for tires?". He took my money and ran. Do not buy from Excel Motors, unless you have an extra 500-1000 dollars to fix the things he will say are you problems now....]
