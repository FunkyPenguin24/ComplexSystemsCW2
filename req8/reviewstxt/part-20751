[102616230902492743416,100099422683185169813,Cat's Corner is one of Montreal greatest gems. It is an incredibly friendly, judgement-free environment where everyone is open to meeting new people, making new friends, and just wants to dance and have fun. I strongly recommend trying out the Friday night Downtown Stomp; I guarantee you'll leave the place brimming from ear-to-ear and will be hooked! I first walked in as an incredibly self-conscious, two-left-footed hot mess and just a few short weeks later not only made lots of new friends but could actually swing!]
