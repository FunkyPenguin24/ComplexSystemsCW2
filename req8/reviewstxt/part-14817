[110191145884649112182,100957178714910445959,Comfy, cozy, wonderful smells and tastes! Just like being in Grandma's kitchen with fresh baked goods, yummy soups, pizzas, and fresh coffee (oh, but Grandma never had latte's), and warm wood with cozy couch sitting areas. I love my new discovery and only wish I could spend more time there with a good book! Oh, and it's a great place for having a committee meeting too!]
