[107246731399264285997,100126196058610867821,The greeting was bad at the walk-in. I ordered the grilled octopus plate and my date ordered the chicken. My plate was served with overcooked canned vegetables, the grilled octopus was a sponge full of grease and the garden salad that I asked for with dressing on the side and didn't vet that way, was served with one half slice of tomato that they wouldn't have been able to serve tomorrow. A food bank would have given me fresher food! We ordered coffee that tasted great until the last mouthful. It was full of coffee grains so I was almost thankful to not have been offered a refill. Overall... I wish I had stayed home and cooked. 2 thumbs DOWN]
