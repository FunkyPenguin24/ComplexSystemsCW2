[105680415233878023084,100079856193954048649,I have been a patient for only about 3 months but after seeing the great work Dr. Vadecha did on my little brother and sister and some family friends, I knew this is where I wanted to get my braces. The staff are very friendly and courteous. They have exceeded all of my expectations! Thanks to everyone at Lakewood Orthodontics for excellent service. Keep it up!]
