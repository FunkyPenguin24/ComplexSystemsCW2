[101602100442350921994,100588891282534164337,i bought a 2013 camry se and another one 2014 se. Customer service was good but unfortunately the 2013 one that was bought in may 2013 has a lot of issues the headliner is chiseled, and when i got the car it had a scratch on the clear coat which they never fixed. I have shown the car to Don Mc Gill they say the entire roof liner needs replacement. Im still hoping that Fred hass to could satisfy me today because all these issues should have been addressed before the car was handed over to me. Also when they gave me the vehicle the fender brackets were not installed they were sitting in the trunk. After going to toyota dealerships so many times im getting sick and idk if i would get a toyota again ( lol i was going to get a highlander in February but this camry experience is making me thing again)]
