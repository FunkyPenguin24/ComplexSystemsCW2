[108396122898617107087,100044431051361146790,I agree with Ashlee. I am very nervous going to any dentist. Recently I experienced a terrible tooth ache. When I met Dr Weston I was so relieved as he has the best bed side manners I have ever experienced with a dentist or specialist. He explained every step of the process to fix my tooth. I felt nothing but confidence being in his hands. During the procedure he was gentle and I felt very little discomfort. I was able to swallow whenever I needed too, he is very understanding and compassionate of my nervousness. I still have to go back again for the final work but I'm not worried as I know he will look after me. Thank you Dr Weston and all the wonderful girls that work with you. I will be recommending your practice to all my friends.]
