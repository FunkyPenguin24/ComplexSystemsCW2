[102473633135454277556,100966527932767766594,I've been coming here for years, and even though the change in management altered some of the recipes, it is still my favorite restaurant. I make a point to go at least once every time I visit from College Station. The portion sizes are huge. The sauteed tofu is to die for. The guys that work there are always friendly and speedy. And it's CHEAP, considering how much you get for the price. I love this place.]
