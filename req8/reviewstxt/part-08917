[117883907447878147726,100634108381406378474,Extremely disappointed. Ordered the Filet black and bleu. They forgot the "black" part. I figured that chefs at an expensive steakhouse new how to cook steaks. I was wrong. The Wedge salad was swimming in blue cheese dressing. Ordered a side dish of asparagus and found it to be bitter to the point of being uneatable. Not ever going back.]
