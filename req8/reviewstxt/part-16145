[106546768075991950173,101029009700171420535,As others costumers , also had bad "experiences" at Bayside! But I decided to give a try once more to celebrate my Birthday , yesterday 23 January. However I need to share that Erick, our waitress was so kind, so professional ,that make my birthday and my guests happy! I think Bayside, need more good workers as Erick! The girls that work there , look like they are making you a "favor"! Erick you are and was a plus to my party! Thanks so much!Any good sport bar or restaurante will be glad to have your service! God Bless you! Marisa Sarmento Edwards]
