[106368928932620314364,100748489845110120004,This place is definitely hit or miss. Some days the food will be great, and others it will suck. For instance I went in on a monday got chicken fingers, they were great; juicy and white meat and nicely fried. I went in on a sunday two weeks later and they were horrid. They were so over cooked the chicken was literally as hard as a brick and when I bit into it, my teeth instantly were sore because I couldn't bite through it. I didn't finish and left after paying my bill. However, if you point out to the staff that you do not enjoy something/there is something wrong with your food, then they will offer you a replacement without charging extra. Some days you will hardly see your waitress and other days they are very attentative, hence my saying its a hit or miss. However I hope you stop on one of their good days and enjoy. Be warned though. If you order their hot turkey sandwich, the turkey is deli turkey slice thick not real "thanksgiving" turkey you would expect.]
