[105311955577626419248,100030073623357072592,I have been working with Tom for about 3 years now. The truth about websites is that they are something that needs constant refreshing in order to stay relevant and perform optimally. Tom has become an invaluable resource for our business in this capacity. I simply don't have the time to learn the technical side of our website, but as it drives a good portion of our business these days, it's crucial that I have someone who is confident and capable of handling that end of things. Tom takes care of anything I need in a timely and thorough manner, without any headache on my end, allowing me to stay focused on the things which I do best. Further, he is always on the forefront of the technology, and reaches out to me whenever it's time to make an update. It's one less thing to worry about. I know I'm in good hands with Tom, and I recommend him to anyone who asks for a resource in the areas of website development, SEO, and/or social media.]
