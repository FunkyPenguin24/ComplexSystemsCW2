[103748742565793749401,101175298834519325789,We booked a 12hr trip with captain Brian for September 2012. There were six of us in the group, including my 13 year old son. We traveled all the way from Minnesota. After exploring over forty different charters I chose Lil Angler 2. Every time I called captain Brian answered my questions and provided a great value of information during my research. It came down to two charter and Captain Brian was my choice. On our day of fishing there was bad weather condition. Brian warned us and we went through it anyway. The waves were rough, but we toughed it out. It was worth it. We caught few non-keepers early then there was some lul time with no fish. Seven hour into the trip and with captain and his mate Johnathan trying different things we finally caught our first Blue Fish. What we did not know it was the first of over 60 we caught!!! It was like feeding frenzy, we kept pulling one after another and it was a TON of FUN!!! I highly recommend Captain Brian and Delaware Family Fishing!!!]
