[108689577691861710609,100742639992633417157,This company is the worst company I have ever visited or try to get any service from. I took my 1981 Ford Bronco in for emissions and safety in the process they proceeded to tell me I need to go at Cadillac converters and a muffler to my vehicle which is a carburetor it is older than an 82 I do not need any of that after they proceeded to argue and argue and argue with me that I need to go out at these things to my vehicle they got frustrated swore at me and told me just to leave so I did and the process they get my emissions papers and registration I come back the next day do grab those papers they have told me babe lost them so this means I have to go to the DMV pay 4 dollars to get the papers to go somewhere else to get my emissions done. So all I have to say is do not use this company ever for anything they are idiots]
