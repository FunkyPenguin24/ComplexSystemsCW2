[117716985642928781191,101163841655419487006,We have been bringing our dogs to the Drake Center for years - too many to remember, and even though we have moved out of the area last year I still continue to take our dog to them for any major procedure. While I feel that they can be expensive, the quality of service of the doctors as well as the front area staff justifies the costs. I have always felt comfortable boarding our dogs with them as well.]
