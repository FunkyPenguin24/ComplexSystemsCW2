[113943898556483119853,101172112630438672564,Got a free stay here complimentary from Winstar Casino. It was an alright hotel. It was clean and they give you free breakfast. The service though could use a little work. First, I come in late from the casino and get all snuggled up in bed to find out my batteries were dead on my remote. I called the front desk and the guy told me I would have to come down there with my remote but he wasn't sure he even had batteries. I told him the kind of batteries I needed and asked him to let me know if he had some. He then waited about 30 mins and showed up with the wrong batteries. He then told me he couldn't get me another remote or batteries but would let me know if he finds some before I check out. Being a customer service freak, I would have pulled batteries out of a remote from an unoccupied room instead of telling my customer no. So breakfast comes around and I go to make me a waffle. I turn the button on and pour my batter in and this lady worker comes over, turns my waffle maker off, and starts wiping out my batter. She says "This one is broken. You should have used the other one" How was I suppose to know. There was no sign and the machine looked like it was working just fine. I think she was trying to clean breakfast up early and I was messing up her progress. Those to employees and the slowest elevator on the planet is what makes me glad I stayed on Winstar's Tab because I would have really been upset if I had paid for it.]
