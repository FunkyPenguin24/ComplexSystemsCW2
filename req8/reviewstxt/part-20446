[106730324478558089289,100083514152831668276,Is this place perfect? No, of course not. But if I could have given 4.5 I would have. We love coming here. We come a couple of times a year. Always a great deal, rooms are fantastic, beautiful pool. If you want to have a Las Vegas Strip experience, maybe not this place. But a great place to come and bake in the sun and hang out in this fantastic city.]
