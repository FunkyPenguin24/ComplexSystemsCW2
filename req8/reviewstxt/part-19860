[100325495750552250559,100052599057399079276,I never would have tried this place just from looking at it from the outside but it was recommended so I went. So glad I did! The customer service is amazing, the waitstaff are so friendly and helpful but aren't pushy. The food is fresh and delicious, I especially love their tacos and tamales, very authentic tasty! If you've never eaten it is a must try. Definitely my favorite Mexican place in the area, and I am huge Mexican food snob :-)]
