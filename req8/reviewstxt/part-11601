[108869946018942516817,100779451512436947638,I love LA Fitness. I like the people (even the old people that just sit on the machines), and I love the way it is set up. The price is about the same as the other good gyms in the area, it just feels better. I never feel too close to people like I do at other gyms. However, the staff is terrible. Just awful. There is one good lady at the front who is nice, and a lady who teaches the spin class in the morning is good. Other than that, they have overweight and lazy trainers. On the weekends there is a lady who sits over in the side desk area and just makes personal calls while swearing, and being completely unprofessional.]
