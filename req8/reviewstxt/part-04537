[109188151047016567591,100400679850177100447,I stayed here for 28 days at my companies expense. The 'self contained' villas are barely apropriate, the extraction fan in the kitchenette never worked. The bedside lamps never worked. The tap in this so called kitchenette dripped continously the whole time I stayed there, dispite repeated requests to have the washer changed. But they didn't hesitate to fleece me of $220 when my room key was misplaced. I recommend you stay somewhere else.]
