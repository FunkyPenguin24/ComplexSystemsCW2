[116266468551527564141,100841897556844604494,Mauricios is our favorite restaurant in Cookeville and most likely our favorite anywhere. We have celebrated anniversaries , birthdays or just enjoyed a date night here. The food is delicious, the ambiance is inviting and comfortable. The owners and staff are gracious and very accomodating. I highly recommend Mauricios, for any ocassion or to show off Cookeville to out of towners!]
