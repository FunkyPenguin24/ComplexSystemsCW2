[113029838245852182546,100806732039210997156,I went to Dr. Greenberg as an adult patient. I wore braces as a child but my wisdom teeth weren't removed till I was 17 ruining all the work that had been done previously. Deciding to have braces for a second time as an adult was the best decision I ever made. I would do it again! Louise Tice]
