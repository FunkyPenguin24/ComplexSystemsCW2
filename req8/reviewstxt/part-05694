[100771080829809139151,100460997871490540189,I had a great stylist for years in WA, and then I moved to AK. I had real trouble finding a good stylist that knew how to deal with my hair. I have natural wave and good volume...guess what happens if someone cuts my hair wet? As it dries, it shrinks up and looks like crap. Nearly dry cuts are a must for me and I called all over trying to schedule someone that knew what I was asking for. I branched out and got a rocking asymmetrical cut. I even splurged on professional color for the first time. The best hair and customer service I've ever had.]
