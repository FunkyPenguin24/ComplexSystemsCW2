[106411912133457428464,101022788808203462721,Obviously the most reasonably priced place in the area. If your rich this place isn't for you. If you want a place to lay your head in between walleye,that provides some of the best food in the Northwoods then you hit the JACKPOT! I challenge you to the Sasquatch burger if your appetite is as big as the walleyes up there. This place makes me feel welcome EVERYTIME like I am part of the family. There are many options for lodging in the area but waste your money on that when your not even going to be in the room half the time... I'd rather spend my money on bait or beer.. THANKS MARTY DAWN and DON! You guys are the best ... BEST VALUE FOR THE BUCK!!! - Fisherman Ben..]
