[105442860537012575169,100414208259223653852,Without question, the best Italian restaurant in the area. The absolute definition of a diamond in the rough. It's hidden away in a crummy little shopping center, the decor is inconsistent, the lighting is dark (which I don't mind, but I know that's not typical), and at first glance, you wouldn't think much of it. The food though, is beyond compare or reproach. I've been all over the country (and outside as well), and this place still has the best pizza I've ever had. Their pasta dishes are superb, their service is friendly and prompt, their prices are reasonable...it's basically everything you could want in an eatery. If you're visiting and pass them up, or have lived here and somehow never been to Cosimo and Suzie's, you're only cheating yourself.]
