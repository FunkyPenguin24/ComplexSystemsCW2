[113013457736122005945,101113537059359240987,If you looking for a really good hand wash joint, this facility is the best by far. This has gotta be the best hand wash joint I've ever been to after living here in UT, California, and Arizona. You have an option of a hot high pressure rinse, which really does justice if you have tons of bugs on the front of the car of something similar. Also you have an option of paying with a card or cash and the price is right. If you use the high pressure wash option, it will leave the outside of you car smelling really good surprisingly enough. Besides just the hand wash bays there are also two automatic wash drive thrus.]
