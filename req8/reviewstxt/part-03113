[110363207519051798583,100320343787389475565,This hotel is CLEARLY not for everyone. I have stayed at hotels across the country from 1 star to 5 stars. I'd rather stay at Super 8's, Motel 6's, and such. Marriott was seriously lacking in the necessities department and they charged excessively for EVERYTHING. Parking...I'm a guest. I should have free parking. Internet...This is a business trip. Charging me for Internet? No Refrigerator...That means no fresh milk whenever I want it. Very aggravating. No Microwave...Fantastic. I don't get refrigerator, why would I have a microwave in my room? That's ok, for the price, they got to have one in the lobby where the continental breakfast is served...oh wait...no free continental breakfast. They charge for it. And no. There is no microwave in the lobby. Now, they do have a large work out facility which is nice. You don't find that it a lot of places. The staff was friendly and helpful enough. Maid service was more than adequate. My thoughts: For the price, they need to step it up and add the necessities. Microwave and Refrigerator and Free Wi-Fi are a MUST.]
