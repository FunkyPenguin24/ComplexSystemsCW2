[102346056676984135574,100289043326392514020,The food is good and its in a very good location. The wait staff is not very smart or discrete. I asked for a duplicate check so as to pay the bill without anyone at the table knowing. The wait staff proceeded to make a production out of it in front of the other patrons. They REALLY EMBARESSED OUR PARTY!!! Then when we went to pay the bill the lady was on the phone and couldnt figure out the correct change]
