[101540030806348629529,100533109649525653689,I recently called Clearwater Pediatric Care to make an appointment for my two-month old daughter. I had not found a pediatrician yet that I liked, but had heard good things about Dr. Pai and his office from several friends. When talking on the phone, however, I was told by the receptionist after she had questioned me about where my child had been born and which newborn tests had been performed (she was a natural homebirth and I had chosen to waive the vitamin K-shot and we hadn't done the hearing screen, only the PKU, which was fine) that the office did not accept home birth babies as their patients. This both confused and upset me as I did not see a good legitimate reason for this sort of discrimination. I emailed the office asking for an explanation and this is what answer I received: "Hello, It is our office policy that all our newborns have to have had the Newborn Hearing Screen, the Newborn PKU Testing, and the Vitamin K injection at birth. We have found that majority of babies born at home have not had any of these procedures done and we feel they are vital to newborn care. We have also found, from past experience, that the parent's of home birth babies would bring their baby to the first visit and we would then not see them again for 6 months or even longer. Newborns need numerous checkups during the first year (the first few days of life, 2 weeks of age, 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, etc) in order to make sure they are growing and developing correctly. These are the reasons we are not accepting babies born from home. I hope I explained that well enough and it didn't lower our office in your eyes. I do wish you all the luck in finding a doctor for your sweet baby. Thank you, Tracy Clearwater Pediatric Care" I guess it all boils down to "homebirth babies aren't good business."]
