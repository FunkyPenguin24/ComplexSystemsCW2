[109656795487666692360,100702809476025634752,Went through the drive thru and ordered a strawberry sunday while they were almost empty, and it still took them over 20 minutes. When they finally brought it, it was just a cup of (mostly melted) ice cream with about a tablespoon of red syrup on top. Needless to day, I asked for a refund (which took another 20 minutes) and will never be back. This is simply one of many negative experiences I have had there.]
