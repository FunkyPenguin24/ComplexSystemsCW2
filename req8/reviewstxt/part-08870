[104309090607937926270,100631458605894783548,We stayed at this Holiday In for 1 night, August 13. From check in to check out we received wonderful service. After check out, once we were already on I10; I realized I left my cell phone on the bed. I called to hotel, asked them to check with housekeeping and let them know we were on the way back to look for it. When we got back 20 minutes later, a manager (regretfully I did not get his name) was waiting for us at the hotel entrance with my phone in hand. This is 5 star service. The Bringmans family.]
