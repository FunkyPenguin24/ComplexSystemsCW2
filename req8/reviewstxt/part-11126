[113828548082845988411,100754873773652439911,I am used to high end salons, but have been getting some really unusual cuts in the last few years since Wade left the Palms and retired. I occasionally read reviews for stylists. Sara Cooper's name had been floating for a while, I didn't care about the bad review on 2 inches, because cutting 2 inches off long hair and designing an appropriate style is a completely different skill set. I made the appt and was worried because I couldn't decide on a cut, we talked through it looking at magazines, narrowed it down to two and then just took the plunge. It's just hair, it grows back and it gets cut again. The whole time Sara was making sure that I was saying YES to that cut. She was right, it turned out excellent. I must say, I was afraid to pay so little for a hair cut. So the salon itself isn't as Posh as a high end salon, I wasn't looking for that and I won't knock it. I was expecting Sara Cooper to perform, and she did. The real test for me is making another appt without thinking about it, and I did, today. See you soon Sara Cooper, and Thank You.]
