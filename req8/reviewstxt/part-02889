[107928573664195631153,100308028585605903097,ABCD Computers Came To My Rescue! Once again Pete helped me solve many questions I had regarding my computer and my sanity! I have an opportunity with a new potential employer that would not be possible if it were not for ABCD Computers today. My stress and anxiety always disappear after Pete has finished the job. Thank you for your ongoing support & patience. Best Regards, Karen W (Loyal Client Since 2010) I have been working with ABCD Computers since 2010 and have had them repair my computer 4 times. I am so pleased to know that when my computer crashes I have Pete to make my nightmare disappear. Although my computer is fixed with expertise and efficiency every time, I am most grateful for Pete educating me on Anti-virus software, and for providing me with simple steps to make the most out of an aging computer, and my overall computer experience. Thank you again ABCD Computers! Karen W]
