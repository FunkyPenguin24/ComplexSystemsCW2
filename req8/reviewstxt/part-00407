To order 4 items, I was on the phone with the boy for 12 minutes. I had to spell my street address was letter-by-letter a handful of times, and even then he did not get it correct. Then, after finally completing my order, I received another phone call from the boy again. When I answered, he did not identify that he was from Duck Duck Express, instead just said "Uh hi, it's me again." After telling the boy what my order was multiple times, he still had to call back and repeat my order to me, and asked for my address again. The service with ordering food over the phone was not professional at all, and very frustrating. If I order from here again, I would appreciate if the employees were taught proper for etiquette for a professional restaurant.]
