[117450432253778953234,100741910302285801642,I purchased my 2012 GMC Terrain in December at McKinney Buick GMC. I was very pleased with the people at this dealership. My needs were taken into careful consideration when my salesman recommended the Terrain. I walked away with a great vehicle and my monthly payments are right where I needed them to be. I can't complain about the free XM Radio trial or the free OnStar trial either! I would recommmend this dealership if you are in the market for a new or pre-owned car. Ask for Jase Patrick, he will take good care of you.]
