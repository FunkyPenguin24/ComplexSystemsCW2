[101174063271370999943,100997198592830287621,This is a wonderful place. If it's not your cup of tea, then don't come here, because it definitely isn't a perfect fit for everyone! I adore it, but then again I don't drink alcohol or coffee, I don't smoke, I don't sleep around, and I don't even like having boys in my apartment past midnight. I also like wearing clothes that actually cover my body, because mystery is always more attractive than blatant sexuality. It may seem like I'm a prude, but if this sounds like you too and you like freely applying spiritual (especially Christian) learning to academic learning and you love to study and work hard (and don't want to go into debt for it), then this is the place for you. If not, you would probably rate this place one star and say something nasty about it. ;) And by the way, yes, I did get plenty of dates, and with guys that were actually interested in ME, and not my cleavage!! I'm getting married to the love of my life in just a couple months and couldn't be happier. We'll probably both pursue our graduate degrees out of state, but we'll miss BYU!]
