[112740525348517355106,100882171681028232576,As a history buff the location drew me in but the outstanding wine sold me on The Winery at Bull Run. The Winery at Bull Run combines history and wine in an amazing setting. This is a welcoming, family-oriented winery appealing to a wide variety of visitors. The decor is in keeping with its surroundings and along with the delicious wine great attention is given to the magnitude of historic events that occurred at Bull Run. History buffs and wine lovers alike will enjoy sitting and sipping in the rustic-style tasting room or out on the patio. I highly recommend a visit to this wonderful winery with an amazing story to tell. I also suggest trying their Norton - a fabulous offering made from a historic Virginia grape! Cheers!]
