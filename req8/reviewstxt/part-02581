[100818558544910444786,100291706443919592857,I leased my first vehicle through Darling's in Bangor. Great choice. I got the price I wanted, I got friendly service, and Bryan Lackee helped me through each step of the process. I would recommend Darling's and their friendly staff to anyone looking to get into a new or used vehicle. If you want someone who will help you out and work to get you the best price, ask for Mr. Lackee.]
