[105988820646491789602,100687502499468999583,We've been to Gordy's several times now, but I've been noticing the quality of the food seems to be going down a bit each time. Maybe its because we ordered take-out the last couple times, I don't know. But especially with the dumplings, I think I got better tasting ones at Grocery Outlet for less than half of what Gordy's charges for just seven! PLUS they raised their prices in January, so now it's even more expensive, while the quality has not improved. Further, they haven't even updated their menu online to reflect the new prices, so when I last called in, my bill was about $20 higher than I had calculated from their website! This place was great the first couple times I went, but now it's just okay. I hope they can figure things out, because it would be sad to stop going there anymore!]
