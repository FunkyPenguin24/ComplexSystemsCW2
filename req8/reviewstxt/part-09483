[100240586678663653562,100665268929828116468,The level of incompetence that surrounds this business is unbelievable, I went in to get a simple safety and emissions check, and they informed me that I had failed both safety due to bad brakes and emissions due to an air leak in the gas cap. I took my car down the road to get the brakes done where I was informed that the current brakes were adequate to pass safety, but I had them replaced anyway, as well as purchasing a new gas cap than returned to the emissions plus location where they informed me that I just barley passed and gave me my formsâ€¦.I thought they forgot to provide a retest of emissions so when I arrived at the DMV I could not get my tags. I had to return to this horrible company and watched the man working walk out to my car, open the gas cap and then pass it off. (Very interesting way to check that the leak is gone I thought) I WOULD SUGGEST THAT NOONE EVER USE THIS COMPANY FOR ANY REASON.]
