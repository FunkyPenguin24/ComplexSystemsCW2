[102276037416781852004,100466599310336914830,I recently moved to the area and was in dire need of a tune up. I found my local Chevy dealer, at Fairway Chevrolet, and was thoroughly impressed by my entire experience. At first I was told to expect at most an hour for the work I needed; the Service Dept. had me in and out the door in 30 minutes! All of the staff I interacted with were courteous and the waiting area was comfortable and clean. Very happy to know I have a reliable Chevy service dept close by. :)]
