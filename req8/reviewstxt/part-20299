[105853748925592628150,100076290615789859058,Windsor Hills is a great apartment complex for Blacksburg and is very affordable; I ended up living in a pretty good 2BR/1BA apartment for about 2 years. I equate Windsor Hills to be Foxridge without the parties, i.e. the apartment layouts are exactly like Foxridge, but the community is a LOT quieter since it's mostly grad students and young professionals. On top of this, the staff was amazing and I never had a problem with maintenance responding to my requests. All in all, this is a great place to live in Blacksburg at and affordable price.]
