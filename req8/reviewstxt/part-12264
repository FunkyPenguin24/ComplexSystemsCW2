[110828964291245547752,100815265682896615888,I stopped at the lot a few days ago and was looking for a used suv. I spotted a Ford edge that I loved. since this was my first stop in the car search I left and kept looking. After looking at several lots and even looking online at all used ford edges within a 80 mile radius, I found that Kreiger had the one I liked the most it was in the best condition and was the best price. I did a credit app. online and got a call first thing the next mornig from Dennis Fritz. I told him what I was looking for and he kept me posted while I was at work how he could finance me, ( with great help from Harold, he made the magic happen) and everthing I would need to drive away with my car as soon as I got off work. I drove to the lot and my car was cleaned and detailed and ready for me. Paper work was all done and within 15 minutes I was signing on the dotted line and driving away in my new car. Dennis was so helpful and Harold was very nice and helpful getting everthing approved. I will recomend this dealership and these gentlemen to all who ask. Thanks guys, time for a joy ride! - REGAN CURRY]
