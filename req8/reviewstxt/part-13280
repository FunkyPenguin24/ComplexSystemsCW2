[109129098932246320776,100873180766965633081,Brighten & Jo came out today (5/22/13) to treat the property for pests. I was impressed with their customer service skills, that is a rarity these days. The only reason I hired them today was because they exhibited a high level of professionalism. I refuse to give my money to worthless scumbags. Thanks for having the guts to sell service door to door Moxie, but more importantly, thanks for doing it right.]
