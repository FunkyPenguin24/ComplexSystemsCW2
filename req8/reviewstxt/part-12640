[110579415556760187867,100836229303775740548,Mark & "new guy" Dan came to take care of our large living/dining room area for now and give me pricing for the rest of the house. I was skeptical and thought I'd be a "we did the best we could" experience for them. The house is a rental, and the carpet was in bad shape when we moved in with a 5 yr old and 2 dogs. WOW...just...WOW! I am in shock. I plan on laying on the carpet for much of the evening...just because I can. Oh, and that's not even touching on the fantastic punctuality, how QUICK the cleaning was, and how professional, thorough, and concerned the guys were. I would give TEN stars if I had the option!]
