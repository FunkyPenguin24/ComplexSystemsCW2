[100402888004785965886,101073260362446326134,You can trust Jer. You'll get really excellent, honest affordable work at Jer's Elite. I have heard Jer talking to his staff (who are well-trained guys, by the way) insisting on using high-grade oil, filters and parts without raising his prices. He'll pay a little more for a part to get it for his customer quicker--again, without raising the price. I know I can trust him and his guys to do really good work at an affordable price.]
