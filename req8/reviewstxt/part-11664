[101338439270475732870,100783552386977010022,I wish I could say something positive, but they would not serve me! The hours clearly state that the establishment is open until 8:00 on Fridays, put they put the food away and lock the doors at 7:30 so they can go home by 8:00. Please change your signs to correspond with the hours you are open and serving food, not to the time your employees leave. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE TO LOCAL RESIDENTS. I saw your were packed today at lunch time, but with service like you showed today... GOOD LUCK]
