[113986563503169502905,100116198069481625703,I LOVE Fuller & Son's Hardware, especially this location on Cantrell (altho they are all great!). I walked in, was greeted promptly, told them what I was needing and they walked me to the aisle, helped me find what I needed and I was in & out in under 5 minutes with exactly what I needed to fix my issue. THANKS, Fuller & Son!]
