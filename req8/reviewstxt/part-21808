[113657184174531629077,100156654524722117142,We went up there to look for a second family car. The car we went to look at didn't fit our needs so we looked at another one. At first we were happy with our salesmen but we very quickly realized he just wanted to make a sale. After talking with my husband we decided that we would trade the car that we had in for a new one and buy a second car in a few months. So that we could buy the second out right. The salesmen kept trying to get us to buy an finance two cars that day. When we finally were done signing it was late and dark. we drove he 60 miles home. first thing in the morning when we went out to the car we noticed that they did not detail it right. there was swirl scratches as if a rock was in the buffer. and about 20 white paint marks going down the side. we have tried contacting them with no return calls. We have had this new car for three days and just found out the bluetooth wont work. don't waste your time and money.The only return call we got was from the salesmen trying to once again get us to buy another car.shady shady shay *************UPDATED***************** Jennifer worked hard to change our opinion about Jim Norton. While she could not change how we were treated she did work hard to make things better for us. If you have a problem with anyone in the dealership i strongly recommend you talk to Jennifer. She returned calls when she said she would, and made it clear that she understood we had issues with the dealership. She did not blow off our concerns and was very professional!]
