[102420573212839295703,100570586671398459472,The restaurant that cheat you with cheap dishes under South Indian label. The management will mske you feel that you are at their charity. If they notice any take away items in your shopping, even if it is from western brands like pizza express, the bald headed moron would come to your table while you are having his charity food and ask you either to put your items on floor or to leave the shop. Whoever expect better service and quality indian food must find other indian restaurants somewhere else.]
