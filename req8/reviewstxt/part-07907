[118333005283858450697,100582423505321967003,I ordered a bouquet of flowers for my girlfriend for her birthday. The flowers were sub contracted to flowers by julie by 1-800 flowers which I ordered through. The bouquet which showed up slightly resembled what I ordered, but was about half the size and the flowers were cut so short they were well on their way to death the following day. I received a 50% refund from 1-800 flowers which was not ideal, but acceptable at least. However, we got a call from flowers by julie later in the day saying they were going to come pick up the bouquet because, and I quote "We don't do anything for free." Well since I only got a 50% refund shouldn't I only return half of your overpriced excuse for a bouquet? Maybe the experience would be different dealing with the business directly, but after this atrocious excuse for customer service I will never patronize your business again.]
