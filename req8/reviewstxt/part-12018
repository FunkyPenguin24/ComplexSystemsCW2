[107888504989301117324,100801970489246033665,I stopped by Tomoko Shima hair salon when I had some time to kill. I went in to check it out, and the place looked great. I thought, "I need a hair cut" and Tomoko was so nice I figured why not? Honestly, it's the best hair cut I have ever gotten. Tomoko is a super talented hair stylist, because lemme tell you, my hair requires real talent to make look like anything, and she did a great job.]
