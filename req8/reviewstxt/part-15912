[116566092489736436978,101016275136060698928,Our stay at Inn of the Patriots was absolutely delightful!!! The museum-type atmosphere was so interesting, the tour was worth the money by itself - fascinating!!! The breakfast was delicious too. It is an old house, so do not expect it to be like a new Ritz Carlton Hotel - it is an historic bed and breakfast! BUT, it is very nice, clean, well decorated and still has the modern conveniences of cable TV and wi-fi. Could not have had a better time, been more welcomed, and learned more at any get-away location. My wife and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place!]
