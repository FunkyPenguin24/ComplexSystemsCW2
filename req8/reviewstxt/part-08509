[115469242516124687138,100613880443702720066,I'm visiting from out-of-town and had a little time to kill, so I went to this shop. I'm completely new to serious cycling, and they answered every question I had. I think the guy helping me was named Jason. He knew I was visiting and wouldn't be a likely sale, but he still answered every question I had and helped size a bike for me. It was a wonderful experience and I recommend this shop to anyone new to cycling. I'm glad there are still pleasant businesses like this one. I will definitely keep them in mind when it's time to make a purchase. I don't live too far away to come back for friendly service.]
