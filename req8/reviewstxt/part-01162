[106124865377820120433,100219608611418163483,"MY" Lexus has been the best car I have ever owned, driven, and slammed miles on as a single Mom (ie... taxi), news anchor and community advocate. My Lexus dealer cannot be beat. Joe Brooks is the person who takes care of me normally when I step through the doors of the Lexus dealership.....although Joe has not been there a time or two (I guess because he does have a life beyond Lexus) and anyone I've ever dealt with at the dealership treats me as if I'm Donald Trump and I have the power to say "You're fired !" Now....I'm not that kind of person but to get rid of my friends or the best car I've ever driven would be ridiculous. My last 3 cars were Jags....OMG. My problem now is not that poor little cat that can't keep up and cost a billion bucks every 3 weeks. It is my fear of retirement. I want to drive a Lexus when I retire....BUT WHAT IF I DIDN'T PLAN RETIREMENT RIGHT ???? I can't imagine being in any other car or with any other group but the wonderful staff at the Lexus dealership !!! You think that's silly right ?? It almost borders on lusting for the darn thing. I'm serious. Lexus is MY CAR !!!!!! Not just because it is GORGEOUS but it is dependable, easy for me to understand too. If my tires are low or I have a nail or slow leak...... it tells me. If something else is wrong, it just tells me. I go in acting like I know what I'm talking about although I know they would never take advantage of me any way. I am a single mother, news anchor and in the community with as many as 250 events a year. I have to have my car and I have one that is stunning and takes care of me. So does the Lexus team. No/.... "they did not pay me for this endorsement but they sure sold me a FINE car !!!]
