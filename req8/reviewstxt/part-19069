[108183604380450101655,100009295207205129490,Sitting in pain for an hour and a half and still not being seen(let alone the usual hour wait to be seen by the actual doctor after they take you back to the room: total 2.5 agonizing hours) is asinine!!!!!!!!!!! I feel really bad for the lady upfront, who they probably don't pay nearly enough, has to sit by and watch this atrocious service take place.....If you can't run a business properly it's time to close the doors!!! Btw I don't expect McDonald's wait times but I also don't expect to have to pay rent either!!!! Please management staff of this urgent care hire another doctor....obviously you have the demand for your services..... btw I left after an hour and 45 minutes wait!]
