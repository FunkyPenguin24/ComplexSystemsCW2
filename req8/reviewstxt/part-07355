[109703227125978104610,100552293461697147281,I went in to get a full set of Acrylic Nails done. Wasn't Greeted when I walked in, they acted like I wasn't welcome and wasn't wanted as a customer. No other customers in there either, Got the nails done and the whole time the man wouldn't even talk to me and if I asked a question or tried to make conversation he acted annoyed. I wanted my Ring finger and thumbs to be a different color and the rest white tips, and he only did the ring fingers. VERY POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! They also charged me extra for using my Debit Card and was not every nice about asking to add their tip on there (Honestly they didn't deserve one!). The price I paid so was not worth it. $42 down the drain but at least I know not to go to that nail place again.]
