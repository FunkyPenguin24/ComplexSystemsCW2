[101714036736900850788,100250719688614433914,I honestly have no idea what the other people are talking about. I eat here as often as possible and love the food. I wouldn't exactly call it upscale by any means, it's just a diner, and so you should expect the usual diner atmosphere (loud) and help (won't wipe your bottom for you), but man the food is good. The batter-dipped fries are the best around, and their sandwiches are great. Breakfast too.]
