[101661334767339149305,100661142125326860708,We went there not expecting high class for for obvious reasons but when a menu says "Ribeye Steak $16.99" you think well it may not be the best ribeye but hey lets give it a try. My girlfriend got the steak fajitas and they came out on a sizzling platter and were pretty darn good. My steak came out and it was what i guess you call a t-bone though very thinly sliced. And the mashed potatoes were cold so i sent it back to get the correct steak. 10 mins later our server came over to me to inform me that they only had the 10oz left when i had ordered the 12oz .... ok fine but they should have told me 10 mins ago. 20 mins later my steak finally came and i honestly could not have been more disappointing. it was the FARTHEST thing from a ribeye and for them to advertise as such is ridiculous ... it looked like the same meat that my girlfriend got in her fajitas just not cut up and obviously wasn't cooked medium because the cut was so thin it's just not possible. Worst steak EVER! On the upside the honey BBQ wings were really good and I'm sure they have some other good food but please don't advertise a $17 Ribeye and then serve crap steak because you can go down the road to Kroger and pick up a 2 pack of Ribeye for around $10 .... nuff said]
