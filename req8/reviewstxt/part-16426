[110358577240326561938,101043288436104527448,I moved here from Los Angeles two years ago and had a very hard time finding good sushi. Then I found Tom Yum's! I LOVE their sushi, and their Thai food is also the best around. I don't need to travel to Tampa anymore for sushi; the best sushi in all of Tampa Bay is right here in Dunedin!]
