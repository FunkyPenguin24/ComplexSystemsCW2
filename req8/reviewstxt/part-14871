[105224834309928964518,100960697539422300424,The women's locker room is barely ever cleaned and stinks so bad every time I am in there. I don't think the sinks ever get cleaned and they are all stopped up. One electric outlet comes all the way out of the wall when you try to pull your dryer chord out. Primarily I can't stand smell and filth of locker room. No complaints about gym otherwise.]
