[110458645450966101584,100920564376097769331,I have been a student at Durham Technical Community College for the last two years and have been nothing but satisfied! Faculty and staff go above and beyond for the most part to assist students in their endeavors. I would and do reccomend this college, especially the transfer program. They have a Transfer Center and the Deans of each College Transfer department are the best! They work really hard trying to keep students informed of happenings and opportunities. If you want to know things you can type in the search bar on our website's home page and there it is! This is college not a high school holding students' hands, so it is the responsibility of student to become an informed participant in his/her experience here.]
