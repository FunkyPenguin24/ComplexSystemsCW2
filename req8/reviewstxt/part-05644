[113187634456904463811,100458384021318113072,542 Little Bourke St, VIC 3000 Nine floors of carparking really does requires a working elevator but sadly this is often beyond the capability of this carpark. Located near Spencer Street and the airport bus, one often sees exhausted travellers with heavy suitcases joining the executive crowd on the march up their filthy staircases. In over a month I have never seen one attendant but I have witnessed the breakdown of the ticket machines, the boom gates and both elevators. When I recently tried to trace lost property Wilson Carparking let me know they have no procedure to identify, manage or return lost property. Their indifference to the customers who pay hundreds of dollars in a week is actually corporate contempt.]
