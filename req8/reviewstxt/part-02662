[116478774242537843230,100296220805215118687,Another GREAT experience at Cramer Honda of Venice! Al Issa is my guy and will always be my salesman! This is my third vehicle in the last 4 years from Cramer Honda and will go nowhere else. Dealing with Al, Lance O'Fallon and Tim Platt is always a pleasure as they make you feel like true friend and very welcome in their stoRE. I needed to stay within a certain budget and they did everything they could to accommodate. This is truly one of a kind dealership, and the Honda product speaks for itself! Go there, you won't be disappointed!!!]
