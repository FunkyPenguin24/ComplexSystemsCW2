[107680995966870393056,100827891459716672349,The thing that caught my eye about this place was the trailer with a smoker attached out front. I thought, "Someone's serious about BBQ". I was right. I came back later with my family and got there just before closing time. We thought maybe we should go and let them close, but the owners were very welcoming and happy to serve us. I'm glad they did, because they had the BEST BBQ we've had in years. The beef brisket was awesome; tender, juicy, with great flavor. The ribs were falling off the bone and the sauce was incredible. Also, they have the best collards besides the ones my grandmother used to make. The owner is a great guy and should be proud of what he makes. I'll definitely be spending my BBQ dollars here. Highly recommended.]
