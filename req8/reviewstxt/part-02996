[107393789594868956498,100314480566312367138,Classic Burger of Los Gatos serves the best Patty Melt I have ever had the good fortune of tasting! The rye bread they serve it on is excellent, and they have the option of getting it prepared with avocado, which is a perfect addition to the grilled onions, melty cheese and beef patties in the sandwich. Definitely a must order. In addition, the people who run the restaurant are very friendly.]
