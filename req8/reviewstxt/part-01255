Also, nutritional contents on products repacked in the store (e.g., cheese) are sometimes not labeled. Leafy produce seems to contain more dirt than that from other stores. This is their one of their first stores coming up from the south and after merger with Henry’s. I feel the staffing is showing more stress, perhaps due to the chain’s rapid expansion.]
