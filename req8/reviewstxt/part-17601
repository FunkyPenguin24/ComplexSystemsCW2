There are 2 full-court, basketball court and a 1/2 (0.5) kilometer track for walking or jogging. An incredible number of street vendors and restaurants, of all sizes, border the park on 3 sides. The 4th side is the problem and that is the high-volume, trunk road, known as Yan'an Road East. Constant traffic noise, at high volume, plus the pollution that comes with it make this less than an idea place to relax or exercise. Combine this with the large population which always seems to be present, in the park and on the move I'd recommend other places to hang out in for a quiet morning, afternoon or evening. But if you just need to pass through for a bit of green in your daily working day this is a place you can enjoy for a short stroll.]
