[112662023782850695150,100784161242891084607,Just turned 40. First time needing glasses. Tried out Elite Vision Care. Beautiful facility, friendly and helpful staff. Patient with my questions and didn't break the bank when it came time to settle up for lenses and frames. Insurance saved a pretty penny...but I was never steered toward the "high end" glasses in any way. Would recommend them to others.]
