[101417800877383937551,101049694214676411877,Best BBQ around. First found out about them on Chicago's best, bbq episode. I was on the episode at another BBQ place. Didn't get to try them till they came to Vernon Hills Big Bear Ribfest. I do have to say they were the 2nd best at the fest. The only one that was better, could not reproduce when I went to the restaurant. This is the story with most BBQ places. Every time you go it is different. RUB however is consistently EXCELLENT every time. Try ribs, Beef ribs if they have them, sliders, Brisket, and the pecan pie. oh... fish tacos are good too.]
