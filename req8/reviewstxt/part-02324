[109515621140682673907,100278852055516325273,This has been my first experience going to a chiropractor. I was very nervous at first but at Superior Family Chiropractic they made me feel much more relaxed and comfortable. Since I have started going I have noticed a huge difference in the pain I suffer from fibromyalgia. I am just amazed. I can do more with my kids now that "mommy isn't hurting". I highly recommend this office to everyone! They are awesome!]
