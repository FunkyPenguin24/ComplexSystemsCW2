[112950297643498403402,100428325145464821057,We have been traveling to Hocking Hills for the last 6 years to get away from the Cleveland life for a few days and "just Be". We have always stayed at Lazy Lanes and been 100% satisfied except for our most recent trip. We were so looking forward to this get away because it was the first time we were able to get time off in the Fall to appreciate nature's beauty. Seclusion is number 1 on our list when booking a cabin and that is how "Creekside Hideaway" was described. It wasn't, there was another home or cabin not even 150 yards from ours, plus the main access road was within view from the hot tub. The couch in the cabin was disgustingly dirty and smelled of urine! The pump of the hot tub never shut off and was so loud you couldn't enjoy ANY sounds of nature. We had to run the AC just so we could sleep without hearing it!! But you can't request another cabin and you loose money if you leave. Unfortunately our days with Lazy Lanes is over. I'm very sad!]
