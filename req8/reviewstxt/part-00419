[105596326602038714202,100180514406673852931,I have been seeing Joe as my Tattoo artist now for over 4 years. His Cosmic Tattoo building is spotless, it has beautiful art to purchase and just an all around up scale place to have your tattoo done! I enjoy the people that work with Joe, and to have Joe see your vision of what you want done and then put it to ink is amazing. I am proud to show his work of art that he has done for me and the fact people stop me in 5 star restaurants to ask me where and who did my work on my back! Thank you Joe!]
