[107746687126141349037,100282292311680502166,As an expecting mother and someone who has long suffered from aches and pains I was looking forward to trying EarthySoul for the first time and I was not disappointed! Eileen was incredible in the way that she progressively worked through all of my tension and aches, leaving me feeling relaxed and ache free days later. I was even fortunate enough to experience some of the reflexology she offers and I must say that it worked wonders! Overall it was hands down the best prenatal massage I have ever had and I look forward to booking my next appointment!]
