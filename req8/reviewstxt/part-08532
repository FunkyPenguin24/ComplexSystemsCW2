[110903491601087453058,100615163502327587055,Overrated place. Service was not good. Reservation handling was even worse. Initially reserved place for 6, after that (within 20 minutes) called again to add two more people and re-confirm the reservation for 8. After being assured that this is not a problem, the table was so small that even 6 people had difficulty placing their plates on the table at the same time. Good thing this never happened as many of the dishes were late.. bear this in mind when visiting. Other than that, atmosphere and most importantly food was good! Although for same prices, I could recommend numerous places with better food.]
