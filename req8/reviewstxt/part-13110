[112128401048956419351,100863968375056955371,From the time we took our Zeus to Haskell Valley Dr. Wiseman and all were great. When Zeus was diagnosed sometime later with diabetes, we did all we could do with all their help. They would keep Zeusy if we went away and always took awesome care of him. When he suffered a blood clot from his heart to his legs we were on the phone a lot with Dr. Mount who took the time on a Sunday to help us and stay with us. We did as she told us and we took him to Orchard Park Hosp. and stayed there the day until we made the decision along with Dr. Mount's help and the vets at Orchard Park to let him go. That was in Feb. 2013 and still mourn over our Zeusy but Haskell consoled us for the next few days...then sent a lovely sympathy card. We miss our Zeusy every day but would always stay with Haskell Valley if we ever decide to get another cat...They are the best in pet care and some of the most dedicqted people who truly love animals and stay with you no matter what!!]
