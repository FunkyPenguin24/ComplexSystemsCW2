[116319459283708856028,100121632545803195399,I have been so impressed with the service and care that I have received at Salama Chiropractic Center! The staff is so warm and friendly and make me feel welcome each time I walk through the door. I totally look forward to my weekly visits. :) Dr. Salama is fabulous! He has corrected so many of my lower back problems and now I am able to move and finally find relief! I can not thank him enough! He has shown me several exercises and stretches that I can do at home to continue to improve my condition. It is obvious that he has true compassion for his patients and enjoys what he does. I am so satisfied and completely trust the Salama Chiropractic team, that my whole family now sees Dr. Salama and I would highly recommend Salama Chiropractic to everyone else!]
