[109557931235881209169,100061350353108329645,I have never had such a bad experience with a company. The first day I went in there it took him 30 minutes to even acknowledge that I was standing in the store because he was helping another customer. Then i put my laptop in for repair {the outlet where you charge the computer was broken...something I got fixed later for $57 at another shop} The owner informed me that he would look up the part and call me within 48 hours to tell me how much it will be for me to approve. I never heard anything else from him. FOUR MONTHS later I finally had to sit in front of his shop and wait for him to come to work, I sat there for THREE DAYS just to get my broken laptop back. NEVER ANSWERED PHONE CALLS, NEVER RESPONDED BACK TO PHONE CALLS. I even tried to press charges and the cop told me there was nothing he could do. DO NOT GO THERE! CUSTOMER SERVICE IS TERRIBLE.]
