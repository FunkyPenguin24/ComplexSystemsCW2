[105136577841580013136,101018236322439777532,I've been going to Dr Lane for fourteen years. He is very congenial, and an expert chiropractic practitioner. My professional banjo playing has me holding my body in an unnatural position for long periods of time. He has fixed me up, kept me fixed and given me very helpful exercises to do on my own. I highly recommend Dr. Lane. His expert deep tissue massage is what helped me the most!]
