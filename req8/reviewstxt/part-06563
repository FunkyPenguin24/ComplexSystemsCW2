[104526527294860047020,100508396401010322328,Rudest chef and worst experience in LA. I've been here once before, thankfully the Chef was nowhere around. This time, while my wife was sampling the new meat curries, the Chef went off on us saying he's letting us sample as a courtesy and we should limit our sampling to 2 curries ( and when I mean sampling, my wife asked for half a teaspoon without any meat, just the curry). And he didnt stop at that. Im guessing he was drunk, because between that and his horrible accent, I could only pick out words i wouldnt expect from someone in the service industry. When he said something about 'next time...' I cut him off saying there would be NO next time. He said he cant run a business if everyone came here and just sampled his food and that he was extremely busy ( all the while, sitting idle in the corner like a zombie and with no other customers). And then he compared his food to Panda Express!!!! The food sucks and the customer service is non-existent.]
