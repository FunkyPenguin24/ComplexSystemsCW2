[110455914152114208683,100316997123205558425,Awful customer service would be putting it nicely. I paid extra to have an item next day delivered. I miss the original delivery because they came by before our store was open, no problem. FedEx and UPS will come back later in the day, Purolator won't. I called and asked if they could attempt delivery at 10am or later instead of 9am, the customer service representative just said 8-6 sir. I asked if they could add a note to my file asking for a later delivery, his response, '8-6 sir'. I asked if I could pick it up this evening, the answer was unsurprisingly no. The representative was rude, and offered no information or assistance other than '8-6 sir'. Chances are good they will come to drop it off again before 10 and I will miss my package again. It is a good thing I paid the extra money for next day delivery. From Now on UPS gets my business.]
