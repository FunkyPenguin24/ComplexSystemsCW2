[103117574906463096133,101166079421041244847,Although this place is obviously not cheap it's a very special hotel with the one room even more special than the other. The sight from many rooms is breathtaking, and there are so many corners and terraces to enjoy the view. The garden is something special: it's really a park: great in Summer without a doubt. The personnel at this hotel is very devoted and passionate about making their customers feel well at ease. The waitress knew a lot about the wines on the menu, and was great with animating the children, who may otherwise have felt too locked up in a beautiful restaurant. From this hotel it's great to visit Rheinfels in St. Goar and take a boat trip on the Rhine to hopefully survive the turn around Loreley.]
