[110358061630449583788,100447641553910893435,Excellent hardware store. The staff is always approachable and very helpful. I would highly recommend that anyone in the area go here before checking out a big box hardware store. On two separate occasions I went to home depot/lowes looking for something only to leave empty handed and find it half an hour later at Gelfand's.]
