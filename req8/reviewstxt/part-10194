[100134917451514170093,100704654645723934160,Two and a half stars would be more accurate, but I'll give Brasa the benefit of the doubt this time. We reserved a table (highly recommended) and were seated promptly upon our arrival. We were seated at a table that had crumbs on it from the previous patrons, but no big deal, swept them off and let it go. The Brasa Experience was explained to us by our waiter, we got our wine and we headed off to check out the buffet items. The salad bar/buffet was mediocre at best. The quality was not any better than what you might find at your local chain restaurant and therefore does not justify the price you pay for eating here. The meat, by contrast, was excellent, except for one piece of sirloin that was tough. However, of the 14 advertised items, only 9 were offered to us in the course of the evening (we were at our table for an hour and forty minutes). I enjoyed the lamb, but this was only offered once. More frequent visits by the servers would have been appreciated. Only one server had the wherewithal to ask if the dining patrons would like meat from another server when the item he was carrying on his skewer was refused. Unfortunately for us, this server did not come by our particular table. Once we had our fill of the main courses, we waited just over 15 minutes to be offered coffee and dessert. The candle at our table remained unlit, which is a small thing, but I feel these are details that should absolutely be attended to in a higher end restaurant. In the end, I don't feel the overall atmosphere, quality and service justifies the price.]
