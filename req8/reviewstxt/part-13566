[104232995418472060544,100888579902860751837,My wife and I love this place. We usually have lunch there once or twice a month. It is definitely a step above the majority of Mexican restaurants in the area. My favorites are Tacos de carne asada, Fajitas, Burritos de carne asada. Their salsas are fresh, and we always get friendly service!]
