[101706022780152632046,101156223694950359867,I was in DC on business and my dining partner had purchased a groupon for $69. Curious, I read some of the recent reviews ahead of time, which made me play close attention. Here is what I found: the service was excellent - our waiter was well informed about the menu items and made helpful suggestions. He was attentive without being pushy. All (!) items on the menu were available to us, including the higher-priced items, so we ended up with a huge discount. I found the quality of the food to be superb and the portion sizes huge, particularly the appetizers. The desert was to die for, which was a great way top of a wonderful dining experience. I would definitely come here again, though I must say that the prices are quite high, particularly for someone from the middle of the country. If you can expense it, more power to you.]
