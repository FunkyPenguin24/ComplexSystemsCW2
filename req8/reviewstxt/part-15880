[117404037906597128759,101014563245327188551,I've owned 5 Saturns and was heartbroken when the company went out of business. I was dreading looking at something else and dealing with "sleazy salesmen." I dealt with Preston Coleman at Spadley Barr. He was friendly, informative, helpful and low pressure. This helped me make up my mind about my replacement vehicle and I am now the proud owner of a beautiful cx-5! Thank you Preston and Spradley Barr!]
