[104827431020188627091,100542724788278839644,When in the mood for great improv, I head down to Comedy Sportz. In the 40+ times I've been there it never fails to impress to me. It's much like the TV show Who's Line, but completely different and better. I have brought half a dozen new people to this place over the years and each of them raved at the amazing time they had. Friday evenings they have special 18+ (recommended) shows so be warned about this up front, all other shows are family and kid friendly. Regardless of the show you see, it'll be amazing. Order tickets a day ahead of time at least, they sell out many shows.]
