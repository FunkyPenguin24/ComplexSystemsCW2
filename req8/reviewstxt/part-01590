[104374799675604298335,100240998495010793851,I printed my wedding invitations with Print and Copy Factory and could not have been happier! I designed the files myself and they gave me lots of guidance on file size, bleed and trim so that they turned out just right. They were nothing but professional, prompt and accommodating. Dave and Becky made sure that my invitations turned out just how I had imagined, and turned them around in less than 48 hours. I was beyond impressed and would recommend them to anyone!]
