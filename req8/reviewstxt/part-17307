[112176011694441882376,101092287026804345114,Typical experience i suspect. Nothing can be done about anything here without "headquarters" making the call... and it's in Conyers. Sorry didn't go to there first. Now i get to spend a whole other day with my friends at DDS :( Ugh... Wait time for the first failure was an hour. Two hours later im still waiting for a supervisor to call my number.]
