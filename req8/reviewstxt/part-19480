[111616943413224397202,100031722812322265139,I had the absolute best experience with the customer service associate at the Public Storage facility in Randallstown. Though I am an infrequent user of our storage unit, each time I visit I am made to feel like a member of a family. Erica is always bright and bubbly with a smile to match her tone. She is helpful and resourceful. You are lucky to have her, beware I am an Office Manager always in search of people like Erica! Kudos, Erica, you ROCK!
