[112161274307745834286,100219642145883809365,Going to make this short and sweet. The staff here are wonderful! They are serious when they need to be but also know that diving is supposed to be fun. We went on two great dives with Larry Hogan as our dive master. He was always quick to point out of the creatures that can be found in the waters off Hawaii and to know what to look for on each dive. Will definitely be going back next time I take a trip to the islands!]
