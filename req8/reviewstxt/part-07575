[106570659201461840958,100564514499625302214,I had the privilege to meet Bo during a recent product photo session. I was immediately impressed with the kindness and professionalism of both Bo and her husband Brian. They were extremely helpful and accommodating during the entire session. It was so easy to capture beautiful photos of their products. Bo graciously gave me a few samples after the shoot to bring home to try with my family. Not usually being an Organic product user I was interested to try out the products. I usually use strong scents, which are obviously more artificial and full of chemicals. After one month of using Bo’s cream and underarm stick I fell in love with the products. Penny Lane’s products completely changed my mind and I am now a faithful user of her Organic products. For sure I'll be ordering replenishments! Thank you Bo for your quality products and for helping me to realize the power of organic products.]
