[113085638609125946838,100381010158330043298,Eastside Kia gave us amazing customer satification. My wife and I went to go buying a used car at a dealership nearby and no one gave any attention to us and tried to up sell us. We decided to then go to Eastside Kia and then looked around there. We thought all salesmen were like so we ignored everyone for the first 10-15 minutes. Then Terry along with the sales manager Jarrett came to greet us and answered all the questions needed to know. Finally at the end result, we bought a car. Keep up the great work Eastside! The experience with you was definitely different!]
