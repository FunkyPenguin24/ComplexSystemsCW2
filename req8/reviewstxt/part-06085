[116488522799314505546,100481905967787871733,I went into this very friendly, up-scale, store in NYC about a week ago to sell some old gold jewelry I no longer had use for. I had been too many other jewelry stores, gold buyers and even some pawn shops and wasn't getting near what I wanted. My salesperson at DD Buyers was so knowledgeable and welcoming, not only did I sell them my jewelry (for the best amount I found anywhere), but I also ended up selling them my old Cartier watch (cash was too good). They made a normally unpleasant experience very enjoyable. Thanks, DD Buyers for your great, fair business and great people!]
