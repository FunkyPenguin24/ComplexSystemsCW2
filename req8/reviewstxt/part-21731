[117308172266461794518,100152559174189130107,I stumbled upon Memorial Weight Loss Clinic by going to physical therapy and I so glad I did. The office staff and doctor are great. They turned me on to the website of My Fitness Pal and it's the greatest thing to track your calories and exercise. If you are not using this app you really need to try it. I like that the clinic is all about eating the right foods and keeping it at a certain amount of calories and exercising for a lifelong road to happiness.]
