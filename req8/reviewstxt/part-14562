[114198319740036685903,100943607578995845218,Trader Joe's for my family has been not only convenient with the pricing but the quality of the food is excellent.. The folks at Trader Joe's are nice and friendly and seem like they acuatlly enjoy their jobs. I also have a service Dog Max a German Shepherd and he is always welcomed and treated with the upmost respect. Oh and one more thing; I suggest everyone (well the peanut butter lovers) try this for dessert: buy the coffee blast ice cream, Peanut Butter the creamy one and cinnamon. all together and it is delish!! Thank you Trader Joe's for your service!]
