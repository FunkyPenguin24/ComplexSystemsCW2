[104082269108909576827,100315358099486664066,Gave me a hard time about my 5 year-old's request for just crab with no rice. All we asked for was 6 crab sticks. Come on manager, how much can a 5-year old cut into your profit margin? Dining out shouldn't be this difficult. After all, I did spend 50 dollars. WOW. Sushi Ten is more child-friendly and much better value and service.]
