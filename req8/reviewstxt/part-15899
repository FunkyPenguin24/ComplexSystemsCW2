[108470813148775283029,101015408263145015687,NOT PET FRIENDLY I called the hotel to confirm pets were allowed/permitted. The hotel receptionist said, 'yes, we allow pets'. At that point, I proceeded to make my reservation through Orbitz.com. When I arrived at the hotel to check-in, I was informed the hotel only allows 1 pet per room and the pet cannot weigh more than 15lbs. I was traveling with two dogs - one of which was over 15lbs. I explained to the receptionist that I had called the hotel the day before and was not informed of the hotel pet policy - only that pets were allowed. Despite this, I was still told I would not be permitted to stay at the hotel with my two dogs.]
