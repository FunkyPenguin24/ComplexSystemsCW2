[102942792782785206566,100954021420160658592,Great selection, great location, and truly a shame the service is so lousy. I decided to go in and check out the wares. A salesman walked by and asked if I needed help...funny thing is that I responded by complimenting what the store had (it really is a nice layout), and the response was 'do you want to buy something or not?'. Heh...nope :-) I'm betting if you get on someone's good side initially, you're fine here; if you don't fit the mold (still working on what that may be), you're treated like dirt. I like to have a decent relationship with a brick/mortar establishment, and this place is just too inconsistent (esp. based on the other reviews) to risk blowing my cash.]
