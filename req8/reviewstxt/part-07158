[101042778088510725519,100540968348529413121,crummy service, rude staff, inflated prices. Was having 4 tires replaced on my car, told them I wanted to keep my old tires because they still had tread left, and to avoid their "disposal fee". Surprise! They claim to have thrown out my old tires, "but don't worry, we didn't charge you".... surprise again - there is a "shop fee" on my receipt to the tune of the disposal fee. I'm sure, from the vibe i got about the place, that they also kept my old tires to sell to other customers. 2 times while i was waiting, a member of their redneck staff came out and quoted a ridiculous price for some no-name tire to a lady who had a flat. Buy your tires from TireRack, and avoid this place!]
