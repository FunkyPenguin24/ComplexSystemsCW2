[105602429015741007114,100073974572612345797,I had Room 217 which has exposure to Interstate traffic noise, but that noise faded behind the closed door and closed drapes--like white noise which let me sleep well. The heater worked well. The bedding was firm and clean--no bugs. This is a basic hotel room, but it does have a coffee maker, microwave, fridge and TV--nothing fancy, all requirements met. Bathroom was clean, with bottles of shampoo, lotion and bars of soap. Lighting is more than adequate. I felt safe in my room and between my room and the office. Don't know anything about the sound insulation between rooms, as my neighbors were quiet. The continental breakfast was no less that what we had at the Acme motel last year. Good pancake machine--one button--clean, no sloppy batter outside, no fuss. Not the palace but neither are the room rates. I'd stay there again.]
