[102756064655391620856,100672119138979756734,My experience so far has been tremendous. Since Bakke was launched officially in Guyana, I enrolled as student in the MBA programme. I actually switched from another on-line university in which I was enrolled to pursue my MBA. However, in that university there was something missing. I was doing well in the class work, readings but I was unable to comfortably share my faith experiences. When I transferred to Bakke, it was where I needed to be. The faculty, support staff, are all amazing and supportive. In the first session, the orientation, I knew I was in the right place. I was experiencing some difficulty with my internet and connection and the BGU Staff based in Jamaica was so patient and helpful, I was never treated in this manner before and I did not even start a class as yet. Each faculty bring their unique presence to the classroom, each class as well contributes to my life first then to the wider community. The love, respect and comradeliness felt among faculty is also translated to students. I am currently enjoying my journey at Bakke, it does not even feel like I am in school. It more feels like I am among a group of friends learning.]
