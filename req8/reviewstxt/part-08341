[107270524920005518018,100605794349279033170,Kombi van I rented was not properly inspected before I took it, the next day I noticed the tires on the van were very dangerously worn out. The tread on the tires was separating from the casing. After four or five phone calls, they agreed to switch out the Kombi with another one. This one, was much newer, and offered at no additional charge. However, I also had a problem with that Kombi. After two days of calling the front desk and being promised a return call from the manager, I was told that I would have to bring the Kombi to the airport to see if they could help me. In general, the staff at the front desk are unhelpful. I would strongly recommend going anywhere other than here. Maybe consider walking. It might be less frustrating.]
