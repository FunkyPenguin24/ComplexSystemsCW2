[112298488687871336440,100741649735286828742,Candy Blitz is TOTALLY fun! It has lots of choices, the owners are so awesome with their customers and the decor and environment is amazing for kids.....and kids at heart! I would absolutely recommend it for people who live in St. George. And put it on your list for "places to visit" on your trip to Southern Utah!]
