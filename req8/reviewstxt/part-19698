[109438570042928118010,100043878021716208587,Date of visit: 01/10/2013I have never reviewed a place before so I'll keep this short. Went here recently with some people. I honestly was enjoying myself; food was fine, not mouth-wateringly so, but it was alright. In fact, I nearly finished it. Nearly. Found a long, blonde hair hanging off the edge of my chopstick. The hair didn't belong to me or anyone at my table. This has probably happened to a lot of people, the lucky ones usually find the hair before they nearly finish the meal. So naturally I let one of the employees know. The employee then gets her manager. Now I'm explaining the situation to the manager and I tell her I want a refund. She immediately says she cant do that because I, "ate all the meat". Yes, that's what she said. I then replied. "yes i did, thats what makes it so much worse". She continues to say she cant give me a refund, only a credit. I did not take the credit, I didnt plan on coming back to this place. This is not a case where someone eats nearly all the food, and then decides they don't like it and want a refund. Hair in food is something everyone does dread, but really cant avoid. It happens. Its the response I received from management that bothered me most. Never returning, and I advise others to do the same.]
