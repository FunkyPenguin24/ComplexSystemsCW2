[102703002117593621234,100189237166753444478,I recently came in to purchase pavers for my back yard. It was HOT and so many customers and employees were tired and crabby (myself included). The cashier in the outdoor department (Gracy May?) was great! Super helpful and very knowledgeable on the inventory and what we needed. We ended up purchasing a pallet and they loaded it within 10 minutes. Will definitely be coming back.]
