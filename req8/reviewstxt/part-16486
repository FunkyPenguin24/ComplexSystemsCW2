[116365767058614761820,101046292108379742094,I bought multiple items for Bible School. This store is not close to my home so I admit I have had the return in my car since July, but in perfect condition, in the bag, with the receipt. The store was friendly enough when we purchased the items and assured us we could return unused and unopened items. Well.............not so fast. The man circled the place on the receipt that said must be returned in 14 days. I admit I did NOT see that, but he would not even consider store credit. Needless to say, I won't be buying more S.S. or VBS or anything else in this store. Sorry to say, this is why Mennonites have a bad reputation for being close-fisted. It's also why K-Marts and Wal-Marts flourish. Be reasonable with your customers.]
