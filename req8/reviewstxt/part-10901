[112389356833317237861,100741912915293717945,I have gone here several times but recently after the snow hit I went again and the things that whip against your car apparently accumulate sand and other particles that damaged the paint on my car! There were no scratches before I went in! When I brought my car back to the car wash they said that it wasn't their machines and there was nothing they could do to help me. Awful customer service.]
