[102584059892618237844,101144901691424303933,I have been a Real Estate agent for over 10 years with a career spanning from coast to coast. I have seen the up's and downs of this market as well as seeing great and bad brokers in the industry. I had the pleasure of interviewing with Anthony Franzese 2 years ago and found him very intriguing. As a broker he is a pleasure to work with. He's very knowledgeable about the area and has an keen vision of where the market is going. Anthony always stress's to us agents that we are the face of the company and that service to our clients is the most important priority in serving the real estate needs of buyers and sellers. I feel very blessed to have had stumbled upon this office and look forward to a long career here.]
