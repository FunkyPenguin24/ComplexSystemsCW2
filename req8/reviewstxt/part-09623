[100083662678189616199,100673165237808874272,My experience at the Long Beach office was extremely pleasant. The entire staff takes their time to explain and ensure that I'm comfortable each and every visit. I am especially grateful to Angie. Angie made me feel at home as she guided me through each process during my visits. She made sure that I was at my scheduled appointments on time and called me just to make sure I was okay. I feel extremely comfortable with this office and it's staff. Thank you, Elliott]
