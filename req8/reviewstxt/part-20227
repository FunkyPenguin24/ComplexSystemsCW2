[101103472335189781499,100072084329575705199,Ordered wings as an appetizer. If your a fan of ranch you will LOVE their ranch. The wings were fresh and hot with a lot of flavor. Ordered the full rack of baby back, literally best ribs ever. Meat just fell off. Also ordered the Haystack Cheese Burger. Awesome. All in all a great experience. Great service, hot awesome food, good locale. You won't be disappointed.]
