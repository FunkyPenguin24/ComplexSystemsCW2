[110147960917743549862,100333662958733689563,Our car wash was bunk, make sure you check your vehicle before you drive off. Sad, we just had a "full" service wash, paid out $18 with a $2 tip and when I called and spoke with "Daryl" to explain the rims had not been touched, I was told "oh we don't touch the rims unless you pay for it" "sorry no one told you that". So in their opinion the "outside" of the vehicle does not include the rims. What a joke.]
