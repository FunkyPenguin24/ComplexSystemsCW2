[107912482597513759549,100454208404589257837,I will never waste my money there again! After 30 minutes of being there my daughter fell in a unsecured access in the pirate ship. She was cut and bruised very badly. They didn't apologize or offer a refund, they just made excuses. It was overly crowded and run by a bunch of teenagers. It cost me $136 for 4 people to get in and we didn't even get to enjoy ourselves! WHAT A WASTE!!!]
