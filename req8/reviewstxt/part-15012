[113534594900890814675,100967856252969010701,My family has just adopted an moluccan cockatoo. We are very excited about our future with Magellan. We had our first visit with Meadow Book Animal Hospital, and they were very helpful. We now know that Magellan is healthy, and we know the type of food to feed him as well as a few things to look for and avoid. We were also able to get a list of prices for future care needs so we can fit them in our budget.]
