[107554142721445005514,100120971266148407566,This was our first experience with Barnes Plumbing and Heating, but we really wanted to find someone local in Castle Rock. We called in the morning for a broken furnace on a really cold day. They were out right when they said they would be, fixed the furnace, and charged a very fair price. No trip charge, we just paid for the work done and parts needed. We were very pleased with the professionalism of the technician, and had an overall great experience. Definitely would call them again.]
