[112520275129592576971,100515880568984313943,The experience began as soon as you walked into the hotel! I was there for a business trip and stayed 6 nights. The staff was always professional and extremely friendly. Bethany, in particular, went out of her way to ensure the customers had what they needed to make the stay comfortable. The quality, facilities and service was amazing. The rooms were very clean and extremely nice and comfortable. I will stay here again if in the area and would definately recommend this hotel to others.]
