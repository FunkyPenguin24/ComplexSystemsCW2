[102211882743899081294,100262955588021809925,Titans Gym is awesome, they've actually recently relocated to the old Salvation Army building on Church st and it's even better than before. There's loads of new equipment as well as free weights, there are also some massive tyres outside the front of the building to practice your tyre flipping and show off! Tim is a great bloke and really helpful, and he offers pay as you go membership which is much better than the long subscriptions and contracts that other gyms try and rip you off with. Best gym in Blackpool!]
