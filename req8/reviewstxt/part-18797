[110502286342282878084,101172498686980716864,From the service received and complete desire to make sure I got into the vehicle I specifically wanted is the main purposed I rated all 5s(Great)...Kudos to Lamar Mclaughlin for his energetic and positive approach and strive to not give up at getting my now purchased Dodge Magnum when the deal almost didn't happen (Bank & down payment issue)...the moment he was introduced as my salesman I could tell that this is a guy that loves his job, and one of the main reason why I will refer as many of my friends that are looking to buy...I would recommend that all car dealerships should have at lease 1 Larmar Type salesman. I also appreciate the service quality that was provided to me by Courtesy Chevrolet I felt very at home outside and inside the dealership, very clean and just like the name...truly Courtesy. I look forward to future service trips (Oil changes ETC.) Gabriel Brown Satified Customer.]
