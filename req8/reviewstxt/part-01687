[115197705662166033986,100246990702753157668,My experience with Thornton's Plumbing was great. I cannot say enough positive things about these guys. Everyone was so easy to talk to and they were very knowledgeable, honest and upfront with me. They are reasonably priced and their work was impeccable. They were in constant communication with me regarding the progress of the job as well as communicating well with my insurance company. I would highly recommend Thornton's to anyone who wants to make a plumbing problem easier. They handled EVERYTHING and they got it done in a very timely manner. They clearly go above and beyond for their customers.]
