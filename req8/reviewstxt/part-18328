Not only did this office get me an appointment in record time. The doctor was amazing. Their office is small and comfortable. The procedure was a snap and I felt supported by the staff the whole time. Dr. Lewis took the time to make sure I understood exactly what was going on. Course when I had additional questions the next day I was lucky enough to speak to her over the phone. They have a Patient Portal which allows you to actually SEE your results and communicate with the doctor through email. It isn't often you can praise a doctors office so I'm taking the opportunity to give credit was its due :) Thank you Sustaina.]
