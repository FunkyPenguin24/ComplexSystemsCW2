[109244074844456859604,100565816765804752631,I felt that the studio was decent (backdrops, props), the photographer quick (which was great since we have two young kids that would have got tired and cranky had it taken longer), and assistant semi helpful, but the fact that they advertise the photo CD (told me when I was making the appointment that the package comes with the high res photos on a CD) and instead give you only low res thumbs and encrypted files that you can only have them reprint (for a hefty fee), really rubbed me the wrong way. It's not that I don't respect photographers keeping the copyright to their work, or that I don't understand this common business model, it's that this was a plain-as-day bait-and-switch misrepresentation of services. When I called corporate, I was told that I misunderstood the purpose of the disk, and that they didn't lie: the disk really does contain the high res photos, they didn't promise that the files wouldn't be encrypted... If you have young kids and want a quick and cheap photo shoot, this place is fine, but don't trust the prices; they're low to bring you in, and when you start to order prints, it adds up quick.]
