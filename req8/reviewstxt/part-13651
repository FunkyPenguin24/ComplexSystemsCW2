[102146249081240823919,100893236182932639199,Dr.Vargas is a good and decent man. His office may not come with all the bells and whistles of a new office but the man helps people and he cares about people. He is a competent doctor, and he has helped me more than words can express. Offers discounted rates for the uninsured and isnt stingy with drug samples for people without perscription coverage.]
