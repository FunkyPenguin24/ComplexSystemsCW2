[106449181884195573631,100188956713407239991,I have seen Leah a couple times for some low back and hip pain. Leah is the first massage therapist that I've met/seen for my specific pain/injury. I've had other massages in the past, but Leah get's right to the problem and I've already felt relief and improvement in the few visits we've had. I am completely impressed and recommend Leah to everyone I know in Salt Lake that even mentions a small about of pain or discomfort. I will be a client for life!]
