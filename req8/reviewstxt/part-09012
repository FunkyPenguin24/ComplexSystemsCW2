[102419755767050915933,100638852031147346264,I've always had great experience with Dr. Doran. I have had two surgical procedures done by him, four wisdom teeth extraction and another extraction from a botched root canal performed by a local endodontist. Unfortunately for me, Dr. Doran had to extract this tooth because it was so infected. Great service. My husband and I thought he had a great bedside matter and very professional. I recommend him highly to everyone. He spoke to my husband at lengths about all of my possible complications after my surgery. His staff even handed out instructions and reviewed everything before and after my surgeries. I don't understand how anyone can say anything bad about this surgeon or his office. But then again, I came into his office with a good attitude...]
