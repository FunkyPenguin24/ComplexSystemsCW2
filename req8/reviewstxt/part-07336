[114674894674486894761,100551286996049196361,The only good thing about this place is the ski tracks. Safety is ZERO. And people working there are worst personel I've seen in my life (including customer service). In the middle of the hardest track my rental snowboard's left foot holder came out (it was not safely screwed). I almost broke my leg but thank god I didn't have any injuries. I walked up to the lift tower on foot and talked to two lift patrols there. Instead of focusing on the accident they started blaming me on cursing because I used "hell" in one of my sentences (Really???). The young one that was thinking he's a tough guy broke my jacket's zipper trying to rip off my ski plastic badge. I didn't want to get in trouble there but I wish I smashed his ****** up face on the ground. Instead I went down to the customer service and wrote a complaint. And can you imagine what they offered me as a compensation? To refund the rental fee of SNOWBOARD ONLY. I drove there 110 miles from NJ. They messed up my whole day, I almost broke my leg, I was blamed to curse because I said "hell", I got a "tough guy" with an attitude yelling at me, my jacket's zipper is broken and all they offered me to refund the rental fee of snowboard!!! Morons!!! People, if you're serious about your safety don't go there. The cashier girl told me that they are getting more and more complaints about broken snowboards and there have been some serious injuries.]
