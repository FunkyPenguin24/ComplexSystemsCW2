[101931282366911424502,100294405175033346328,You call yourself the children of the lord but the lord would not what their children to preach hate to their brothers and sister no matter what they did or who they are. If you have read the bible and the teachings of Jesus Christ then you would know that the person without sin cast the first stone and none of us are without sin since we are made of flesh, so please put your stick done and accept your brothers and sisters the way they are. The latest thing you have done was picketed and shouted out hatred words toward the family of Paul Walker and that inculded his child who is only 15 years old, is that fair think about that next time you decide to step in to some one's busneiss and scar somebodies life .Paul Walker was a good man he dontate his money to people in need maybe you should do the same and put you enegry in to people in need. I am a Baptist too but my Pastor teaches Love and understand no matter how different they are. Well i hope some of this got through and god bless you.]
