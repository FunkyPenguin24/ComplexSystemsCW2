[109115043161988343051,100733797049805907176,My issue: My bank account was charged BEFORE everything was approved, and customer service with the Greer location is severely lacking. This Enterprise charged my card, and everything seemed good until one of the workers gave me a printout saying I wasn't approved because of credit (understandable since I'm fairly young.) That was the last they said anything. I had to ask what was going on, and the lady that helped me said that the transaction had been voided. My roommate and I then walked down the street to Hertz and got everything approved there, but since Enterprise had charged my card, I wasn't able to afford the rental. Thing is, my car had just broken down, so getting a car was vital to getting to work and back home. Corporate has been gracious and is working with me. However, after calling this location back twice now, there has been nothing courteous, professional or understanding about the situation. All they've told me is that the money will be back in my account in 1-2 business days. Second time we called, they said we had to be approved before my card was charged. Shady talk, anyone? (I believe we spoke to Chris.) Both my roommate and I have missed work because we were unable to get a car because we were charged a week's worth for a rental car. We're both pretty much stuck until that money is refunded. Unless you're able to afford getting over $600 or so taken from your account without getting a car, I would avoid this location. However, I wouldn't completely discount Enterprise in general. This is my first time renting a car, and I will probably be going to Hertz for further rentals.]
