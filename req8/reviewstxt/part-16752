[105263423412942116838,101061070013692645924,I have been doing things with Sea Kayak Carolina for over 2 years now, and have had nothing but good times and good experiences. I bought my first and only sea kayak from them, and they were both patient and skillful and helping me find the right boat for me. Believe me, it wasn't easy for them. I went through several before I got just the right boat. I live over 4 hours away in Upstate South Carolina, but have traveled over several times to take skill specific courses from them, as well as a couple of coastal guided tours. The instructors and guides were all just right for what they were doing. Thanks to them, I have learned a lot in a short period of time. My wife and I own and operate a lake tour business, with an emphasis on kayaking, and the model SKC provides for us is one of professionalism and dedication. I feel really fortunate to have found them.]
