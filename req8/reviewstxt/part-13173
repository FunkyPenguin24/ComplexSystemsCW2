[116299367500660222879,100866655016375124863,Everything was awesome! One of the best dining experiences I have had in along time. all of the food is made in house-nothing is pre-made and purchased front mass distributors. I didn't think I wanted fires but once I tasted my friends, I just had to have the special Greek Fries. The Baklava Cheesecake is to die for! Creamy cheesecake in a homemade graham cracker shell topped with honey and homemade Baklava. All well worth eh 45 minute drive! I will be back there SOON! The customer is treated like a member of the family in the easy atmosphere.]
