[100977822356466071624,100857219227096161350,Park Plaza Pizza has been around for ages. Their food in general, is maybe best described as a guilty pleasure. You know the food will be greasy and cheesy, but it will be delicious. Their pepperoni pizzas are actually very unique, if you were to order pepperoni pizzas from the closest 50 pizza joints, you would be able to pick this pizza out from all the rest every time. They have a number of other items on the menu very similar to your standard bar food, but maybe a slight notch better than most bars.]
