[106315826307441678154,100533153705136684628,About to be on my 4th device with CSPIREs internet service. When my 3rd device was replaced I had a huge spike in my service that no one could explain. Took me two days of going back and forth with CSPIRE, being hung up on, no one ever calling me back to get this taken care of. Needless to say, I have had enough with this service and its many issues. CSPIRE has the nerve to tell me that they will not waive the early termination fee of my contract now that I am out of my 1 year warranty period and I have another broke device that I have to fix. How many will there be in the next year of service. I will not be finding out because now, I will be discontinuing all my service! I stuck it out for one year with this device and have been through 3 of them. Service was never reliable and I was charged an enormous amout in december that no one could explain. I highly recommend using a different provider!!!!]
