[118132237330961691292,100406163503628437057,We highly enjoyed our Booze and Bites tour with Morgan. At first we were a little worried about the "touristy" feel of it but that was only for the introduction. We lucked out on having a very small group, meaning the two of us and two additional people, which made our tour even better. Being the foodie of the couple, I need to mention that the food is exceptional and we ended up going back to one of the locations for lunch we were so impressed. The drinks were all great or better. For some reason I thought there would be beer on the tour, but there wasn't. Overall, a really great time and I got to experience food and alcohol that I would of never tried if it hadn't been for this tour. It was such a good experience we tried to fit another tour with Savor Seattle but unfortunately couldn't fit it into our schedule. Chances are, when we come back to Seattle, we will schedule another tour with this company due to the excellence of our Booze and Bites tour.]
