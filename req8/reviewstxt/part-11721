[100424750743269812800,100786407456365885352,Avoid the Travelodge El Cajon at all costs. First off - our small company spends at least $100,000 a year in hotel travel, and due to this I have worked with countless hotel managements and taken reviews from our many field employees. In all my time, I have not had to deal with such an unethical and lousy manager, Baren and his assistant Napha. The review from my own employee was that the area was teeming with drug addicts and homeless, that not only hang around the cars in the parking lot at night, but are also guests living there. The carpet, curtains and beds are decrepit and smell or iodine and semen. The A/C is older than my parents, and the place is reminiscent of a 1950's murder mystery. The bathroom's are not well taken care of, and from the photos taken, there was mold growing under the sink and in the corners of the shower floor. As you can see from other reviews, there is also a cockroach problem. Luckily, these huge critters were not seen inside the room. This place needs to be inspected the city so that they can shut it down. To top it all, we booked his room for 4 nights, and our employee could only hold his disgust until the morning of night 1, in which he was kept up all night by the activity outside. When we demanded that we be allowed to check out and pay only for the night that he was there, the manager, Baren refused to refund the last 2 nights. We were reasonable, and willing to at least pay for the 2nd night, because we were checking out the day of, but they just wanted their money. I hope this hellhole is finally shut down, so that the 'putrid insects' can finally skitter away from this place. (I'm referring to the management.)]
