[102250986789579477120,101166912431490901859,Buying a car is never the most fun experience in the world, let's be honest. The process can be lengthy and high pressure. I have to say, I was very happy with the service Carl provided. Carl was courteous and didn't pressure us in to anything. Carl did a good job at planning to keep the process moving along the best he could on a busy day. I appreciate management's frankness about where they were and where i wanted to be. I would recommend Carl to friends and family who are in the market for a vehicle.]
