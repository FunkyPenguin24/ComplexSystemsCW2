[100473925293923558669,100222310621340828585,Growing up in this church has let me see every facet you could possibly imagine of the place. Change has always been constant, continually growing and learning how to live and love better, but one thing has remained consistent: This church is FAMILY. Regardless of background, race, social status, age, whatever, people find acceptance and hope when they come. I've grown up seeing that church, (and life) is more beautiful when it's made of all colors, ages, styles and types of people. It doesn't matter who you are, you've got a place to belong here, because this church is made of people just like you. I can't tell you how many conversations I have with people who have found us online, through a friend, or just by driving by. All sorts too: People who've been in church a long time, and also folks who are giving it a try for the first or second time. Don't let the big building intimidate you from coming a few weeks and making some friends. Simply put: it takes a big house to fit a big family! You'll be greeted with a smile and find that it's warm and inviting (and exciting!) if you'd give us a chance. Looking forward to seeing you there!]
