[113223226335434014986,100808665877906153131,I bought a Tundra a few months ago from Larry H. Miller and though I loved the truck, I had begun driving much more than expected and needed a more economical commuter. I asked Tyson Holley (my Tundra salesman) for a recommendation and he steered me towards a Scion iq that had quite a bit of incentives attached to it. He worked with my budget, let me drive it, and when the time came to buy it, I drove straight from the mountain (snowboarding) to sign the papers. It was hassle-free, honest, and painless. So different from what I have witnessed with other salespeople or dealerships. I have sent a number of my friends and family to Tyson and cannot recommend Larry H Miller Toyota enough.]
