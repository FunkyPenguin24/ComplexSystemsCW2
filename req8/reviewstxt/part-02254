[104910632927173672082,100275708527403134453,I was a field staff employee at Mountain Workshop for the 2013 season. A recent college graduate, my time at MW was a wonderful transition from college to "the real world" and the experience I gained was instrumental in helping me to get a graduate assistantship. My co-workers were some of the most kind and genuine people I have ever worked with, several of whom I know I will be friends with for a long, long time. The supervisors of Awesome Adventures and the School Programs provided me with unconditional support as I made arrangements for the next season. Similarly, I felt as though I was a valued member of a team. These supervisors continually asked me questions about my experience, anxious to find new and exciting ways to make this job even better for future field staff employees. While definitely tiring, I truly loved this job and would recommend it to anyone who loves to work with cool kids, cool people, and some seriously cool outdoor adventure equipment.]
