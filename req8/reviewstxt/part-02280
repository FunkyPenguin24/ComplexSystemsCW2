[103853767327674902282,100276657496994369121,I gave it two stars only because they always have what I am looking for but... I have visited this store on several occasions and each time I have went to the checkout lanes there is usually only one or two lanes open. Today was the last time I will ever shop this location again. I have stood patiently in lines that were 7-8 people with no one, including managers, standing within a close distance attempting to open another register. One manager yelling out that customers could even out the lines by going to the other register. IF you have to visit an AC Moore, I would suggest visiting the one in Cary at Crossroads. The people are friendlier, they will open a new lane when there are more than 3 people in a lane AND the managers are willing to work those lanes with the associates.]
