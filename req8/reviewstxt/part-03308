[113284309962084497244,100330210630385899537,I wish I had read these reviews before going. First of all, the prices are seriously unreasonable-even for consignment. I found a bath mat that I got at Target two years ago for $2 (in the dollar section) and it was for sale here for $4.50!!! It has appreciated to twice it's original cost after sitting on someone's bathroom floor for who knows how long. Then, while checking out, one of the employees had a huge attitude and was sighing, rolling her eyes, and shaking her head, etc... about my daughter crying. I'm not a fan of her fits myself, but it is incredibly rude to be treated that way by an employee of a store you are patronizing. I left my stuff on the counter and walked out, explaining that I was offended by her rudeness.]
