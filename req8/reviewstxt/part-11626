[103156080483607740278,100781490294168213036,I recently had my engagement ring resized, cleaned, and polished by Barbara Oliver and Co. Barbara squeezed my order in on short notice to have it ready in time for my wedding day. She even finished it a day earlier than projected. Just picked up the ring, and it looks perfect. I am so impressed by the quality of Barbara's work, and the service was fantastic. I will definitely use Barbara again, and I would recommend her to anyone without hesitation.]
