[101926580965276295914,100025808166898001260,I've had the privilege of working with LaunchPad Studios on several projects over the past 3 years and it was been a great experience! They bring professionalism and creativity together to create a great product. I love the comfortable feel of the environment as well as the confidence that the end result will be the best possible sound. With each album I record with them the quality and engineering just gets better and better! If you're thinking of doing a single, an EP, or a full length album, these guys are great and they'll bust their butts to make it happen for you.]
