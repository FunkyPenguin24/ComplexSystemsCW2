[101174829181154491274,100498319174756237752,Went here for a simple steak dinner. Got a 14 oz sirloin that was over cooked and took them an hour to make. Every one was nice, but if I'm willing to pay $50 for a sirloin, then you need to be willing to cook out correctly and in a timely manner. Should have gone to Ruth Chris. Would have been far better steak at a similar price.]
