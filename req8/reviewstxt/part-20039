[100585865366339308868,100062474365117011751,Found this spot when looking for puppy training in August 2011...and it's such a great place that I'm still training there over a year later! I've now got to dogs training in agility. I've participated in puppy, intermediate/basic, advanced/Great Dog!, tricks, Canine Good Citizen testing, competitive obedience, and agility training. I've worked with almost all of the trainers, and they're all fabulous. I'm here a few times a week & it's absolutely the highlight of the week. These folks know what they're talking about & are very genuine in their desire to help you accomplish whatever goals you may have for training your dog(s). The new facility in Frisco is AMAZING! There's also a fabulous selection of quality food, treats, toys and training supplies in the retail area. I highly recommend What A Great Dog!]
