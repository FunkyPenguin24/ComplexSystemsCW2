[109267773470676818637,100738723959272123068,Nathan did an EXCELLENT job painting and performing minor repairs on the exterior of my home. His price was fair and he was very responsive to all my communications. He stayed with me until the job was complete to my satisfaction, coming back to take care of punchlist items, and completely repainting my deck when he wasn't happy with the way it had turned out. I will reccomend this contractor to my neighbors.]
