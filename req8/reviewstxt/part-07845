[101522854517846209504,100579791107389884443,We have used various restaurants over the years since moving to PA. Some have come and gone, but when we discovered Pino's last year, even though we live by another pizza place, they are our first choice. They have messed up once in a while, but they make good on getting it right. They deliver in a timely manner, the food is consistent, the pies are not too heavy on the sauce and the portions are hearty.]
