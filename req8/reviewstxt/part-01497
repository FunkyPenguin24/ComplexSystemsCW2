[104523427683174082530,100236171733761134442,Definitely think this garage needs more of a reputation and more people should know about them! The guys working there are all super friendly, and care about the cars they are working on. My car was hit by a transmission failure and it looked as though it was going to be expensive to fix, but I stumbled across Automatic Man. They had my car back up and running, good as new, within a week. I was so pleased with the work they did, and that I wasn't without a car for too long! I didn't pay too much money, and my car has never driven better! Four months on, and still no problem with it!]
