[104893505963697163620,100629998412804106115,My wife and I visited several dealerships looking for a family replacement car. Subaru of Loveland easily stood out of the crowd in terms of professionalism and a no-hassle sales team. We didn't feel pressured one bit and actually were compelled to purchase from them because they were so good. They definately do not fit the stereotype of a "car salesmen"; these people are professionals and make you feel great about your purchase. Plus, their product sells itself. We will definatley be going back to this dealership next time we need to replace a car. You won't go wrong dealing with these folks and you'll get a very competitive deal.]
