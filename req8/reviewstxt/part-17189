[100642908259135343529,101086469991090444957,I some respects, it is like the trip to Hana on Maui, not much at the end of the road, but interesting views to get there. Do not try to drive in there. The "road" has deep holes that fill with water that could be deep or hiding large rocks. If you walk out there in the winter months, you should see many whales between the Big Island and Maui as you walk along the sea cliffs.]
