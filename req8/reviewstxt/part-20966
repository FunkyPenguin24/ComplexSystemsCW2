[100438742746479362950,100111014460321858462,My daughter and I went to visit for the first time recently to see the Still Life exhibit. While the art is magnificent, the building itself is just amazing! Located in the middle of The Domain, it was nice to just find seat under a tree and eat our lunch. Loved it.]
