[101838215540898336936,100194524463224087098,Insanely delicious. Went here by myself for a mini-escape and was absolutely wowed by the spectacularly good food. Smokin' Bone cocktail, Brisket sandwich and BLT. Yes, I had two entrees. Can't wait to go back! Super -friendly, easy-going service. Nice size chairs. Good music at a reasonable level. Really want to try the pork ribs, the smoky burger and the half pound of bacon. So I'll be back. Soon.]
