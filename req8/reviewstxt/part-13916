[103678792357373277807,100906275658577992457,Came in today to have lunch with my brother and a few of his friends to celebrate his birthday. I was quite disappointed to have Chris your Manager be arrogant and rude in his dealings with us, there was no need for his lack of customer service and rudeness. I will not be recommending this establishment to anyone, the service he showed was terrible, he needs to start thinking about the customer and stop trying to push his own importance around. It ruined the day and we left early because of it. NOT RECOMMENED]
