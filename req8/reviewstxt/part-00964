[113252917225445016021,100209001880535532064,I am a life long resident of Ligonier and this is the place to go. It is family owned and they treat their patrons like part of their family. The Jr Combo is the best and I haven't found a single entree that isn't awesome! This is the place in Ligonier for Authentic Mexican food.]
