[103496715576889794593,100658916865870459987,Went in for a simple battery replacement. I was told it would only take an hour. I went across the street for lunch, came back and they told me they didn't have the battery in stock but they were having one delivered. After waiting another 45 minutes they tell me they had the wrong battery delivered. Point is this, don't tell me you can replace my battery when you don't even have it in stock. They wasted half my day. They didn't care about my time, they just wanted to make a sale. They failed miserably and lost a customer for life. Do business here at your own risk.]
