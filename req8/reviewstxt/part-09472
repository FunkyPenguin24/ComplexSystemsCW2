[109277094452953381776,100664917126832180546,Really a first-rate experience! I had virtually no wait; I hadn't completed my intake paperwork before I was in an exam room being tended to. I think the total visit was less than 11 minutes, far better than I've seen at any other ER or urgent care center. The doctor, nurses & reception were extremely friendly and great to work with. I hope I don't need many ER visits, but this will unquestionably be my first choice next time.]
