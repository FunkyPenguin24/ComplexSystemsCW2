[104730294577641622636,100462682768976171888,I feel comfortable bringing my pets here because the staff is fantastic! They are cheerful, helpful, and go above and beyond my expectations to pet care. The prices are comparable to other clinics I've visited in the past, and I feel that for the level of care my pets receive, it's a real bargain. In the future, I hope to utilize their boarding services - I know the staff will take excellent care of my pets while I'm away. I'd definitely recommend the Burlington Animal Hospital to anyone, out of the places I've taken my pets to, this place is by far the best!]
