[118262372640967969428,100628980604879196716,First of all, I had the pleasure of working with the Owner of Two Maids & A Mop and that certainly gave me confidence in hiring from them locally. The entire company is built on such good values and ethics and is client focused. I hired Two Maids & A Mop to clean a rental property where the tenant had just vacated. They had their work cut out for them. They arrived on time, were very professional and did a thorough cleaning making it "move-in" ready for the new tenant. I highly recommend them and would hire them again! Glad they have an office here in Charlotte!!]
