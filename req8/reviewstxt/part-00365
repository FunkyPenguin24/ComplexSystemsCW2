[113741490219122397800,100178247884997677653,After calling twice to get a checkup on a leaking air conditioner, my husband received a call from Michelle at the end of the day and told my husband "sir, I have 50 of you I need to call back" so he said, "I guess you don't need my business??" and she hung up on him. Customer service is less than desireable.]
