[102071916157450007466,100850394740788988773,My first experience of the Practice was last year when I put my back out. I could barely walk, but over the course of 5 sessions, Ian fixed the problems and my back is largely fine nowadays. I'm back in there at the moment having some work done on my neck & shoulders, and again the standard is fantastic. Ian's frankly a genius (and a top bloke to boot) - and the rest of the staff are welcoming & friendly. I would highly recommend the practice to anyone.]
