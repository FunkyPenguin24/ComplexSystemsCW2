[102997932373382854994,100412469507944727238,Just watched Gravity in 3D. Great film, great cinema, great sound tracks but the "experience" got ruined by people around rustling their bags of pop corn, sweets and crisps throughout the whole film. If you go to the cinema, please think of others around you and eat your food before or after the film. Use your common sense and do not ruin the film experience for others, who appreciate the art of film.]
