[109984423329337200135,100548152514493628558,The Customer Service at this Banana Republic in the Asheville Mall was way below what any customer should experience when shopping in a store. I had purchased some merchandise online that did not fit well, and when i called the store they told me that i could return the products to the store with no problem whatsoever. When i arrived at the store the shorter lady with glasses (no name tag available, but obviously someone of upper management) did not even take the time to open the box to look at the product, she just immediately brushed me off and said she would not be able to return the product without any explanation. She was very rude to me, not to mention the fact she gave me no other alternative to resolving my issue. So now i drove to the store, waited in the line (which took about 10 minutes by the way), and resolved no problem with horrible customer service. Thanks Banana Republic, i'll never be shopping with you ever again.]
