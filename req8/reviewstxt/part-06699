[101593535583923022087,100516759119666519006,Every year we go to Branson and make it a point to eat at Mr. G's. The pizza and crab rolls have always been tremendous, but it has been my last experience that compelled me to write. Our party of 6 came in at about an hour before closing. We had a nice waitress, and honestly, she just wasn't having a good day with orders not quite right, tickets not seperated, etc. Her demeanor was still good, and we were on vacation, so no biggie. It turns out we were there well after close because of the mistakes and miscues. We were all trying to make the best of it, and none of us complained, but when someone came out to take our plates, my dad made a comment about how awesome the food still was, and the person (not our waitress) did not so much as raise his had to acknowledge he was being spoken to! He completely ignored him! I'm hoping someone at Mr. G's reads this, because it kind of irritated my dad. He will be bringing another 12-14 couples back to Branson in February, and I don't think they will be making the trip to Mr. G's. We love the food, but customer service is high on his list, even when things aren't going the way they should.]
