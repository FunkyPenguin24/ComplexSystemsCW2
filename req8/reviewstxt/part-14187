[102162201079378532015,100922341845590700549,Excellent experience with Action Pest Control. They were considerate, knowledgeable, and their techniques work. They used a barrier method at my home, and my house was pest free without any chemical smell, and my pets' health was not in danger. Loved working with them. When I moved to a new city, I called Action to see if they had a branch there.]
