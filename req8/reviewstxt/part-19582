[113355950033836100614,100037607101161224695,This is the first time that we've used a Dogs Love Running and we will use them in the future without hesitation. I cannot say enough good things about this company. Don't be thrown off by the name, they also care for cats if you need them to. Our cat, Ziggy, is very low maintenance. He's a big guy and as long as he has his food and some TLC, he's happy. Heidi, the owner, came to meet us for an initial appointment to get the lay of the land and to meet our furry baby. She review his history and was a pleasure to talk to. She obviously takes pride in what she does and wants to make sure her customers are comfortable with her team taking care of their home and furry family while they're away. Patricia was the person who actually came to check in on Ziggy. She said Ziggy was very happy to see her (she's right, probably because she was his meal ticket). The best part was when we got home, there was a card on the counter with a report for the week. It had visit dates and notes about his attitude, health, and room for any concerns she may have had. The back had a great note from Patricia. Many of the other companies we checked into before going with DLR were either very expensive (way too expensive for a low-maintenance cat) or had too many rules and things they weren't willing to budge on. Heidi was very flexible and was able to meet our requests without a problem, and her pricing is very reasonable. We trusted her and Patricia with our home and with Ziggy's care. We will use them again in the future and recommend them to anyone looking for pet-sitting/exercise services anytime.]
