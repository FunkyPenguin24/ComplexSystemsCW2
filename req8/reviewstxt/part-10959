[110026172310755844350,100745138076197413374,I have always disliked Mediacom's "bait and switch" pricing, where they give you an introductory offer and then the cost incrementally goes up over the course of your contract until you are paying twice as much as you signed on with. But now they have introduced "overage charges" on top of this, where if you go over a certain amount of internet usage a month you get slapped with extra charges. They have the fastest internet in town. This used to be enough of a selling point to justify dealing with them, but now that they fine you if you actually use that extra bandwidth there is no reason to stick with them.]
