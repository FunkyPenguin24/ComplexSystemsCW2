[113079011418895890741,100412048184530743137,I always enjoy going to the Acura Flatirons Dealership in Boulder, Colorado. The salesmen and saleswomen are not "pushy" but thoughtful, kind, honest, friendly, and knowledgable. The service department is fantastic. Sarah Gatton has helped me significantly and has been very patient concerning the questions I have asked her. Sarah is extremely knowledgable, friendly, and helpful, as well as the other people who work in the service area. I know Acura employees are honest; I know the Acura sales and service departments have reasonable prices and provides excellent service. I always recommend the Acura Flatirons Dealership to others and I plan to be a lifetime "fan" of Acura; planning to buy my next vehicle from the Acura Flatirons Dealership and continuing to get my Acura 2005 TSX serviced there as long as I own it. No, one cannot beat the Flatirons Acura Dealership and Sarah Gutton gets an excellent rating from me for her knowledge, patience, friendliness, and honesty in helping me to get my Acura serviced well.]
