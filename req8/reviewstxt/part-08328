[108523644032819418560,100605130871709772765,Two bites into her rama spinach peanut curry, my wife reacted badly to something in the dish and almost coughed up a lung. I sent the dish back, explaining that my wife was in distress, and asked for something else on the menu. Management refused to provide a replacement dish and insisted on charging us for the mostly uneaten plate. We refused to pay for it, paid for the rest of the bill (no tip) and left. We will never eat there again.]
