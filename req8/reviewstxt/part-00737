[101138563638418066064,100197873072317550723,It's one thing to be frazzled and unorganized but its a whole other thing when you are flat out rude on top of it. The folks at Avon Auto and Truck are completely disorganized, never operate according to appointment times, and are frankly rude and unhelpful. I can understand being swamped with work, but its not the customers' fault. I would highly recommend going anywhere else BUT Avon Truck and Auto.]
