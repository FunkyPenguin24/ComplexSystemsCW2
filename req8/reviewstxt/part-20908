[109210871856235944319,100108357545114610565,I joined a bootcamp class in April of 2013 and I have been hooked since then! As an avid runner, I blindly thought this was the best form of exercise for my body. I was able to keep weight off, however I could never seem to achieve the results I wanted with certain parts of my body. After just a few weeks, I began to notice new muscles, better tone and improved physical fitness. Nine months later I am in the best shape of my life. Aside from the results, I love this gym for several other reasons. The staff/trainers are incredible. Each one provides a unique and different method of training and motivation. Muscle confusion is key to results and these guys/girls know how to get it done! Additionally, I love my gym mates! Everyone who I've trained with has become a friend. Though everyone comes from different walks of life, we support and encourage each other like family. I haven't experienced this level of comradery and I wouldn't trade it for anything! Bottom line: Motivation. Support. Results.]
