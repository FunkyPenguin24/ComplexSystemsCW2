[115615669379810404532,100007049207528177420,Took my '12 Passat in for a routine maintenance appointment. I missed the appointment by an hour and when I showed up I was treated as if I had been there ahead of time. No negative behavior for my oversight. Tim was prompt, smiled and had a positive demeanor all throughout my visit. Thanks Tim]
