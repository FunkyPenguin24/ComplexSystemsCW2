[101584645616314603408,100183911243474466655,Way over-priced for what you actually get! Was the food good? Sure. Was it different? Yes. But I can still recognize the bagged baby carrots and frozen peas in their gristly lamb stew. It wasn't anything to write home about. I would add another another star or two if the dishes were reasonably priced. At $20-30 a plate, I should have GREAT food.]
