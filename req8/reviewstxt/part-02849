[105216050379086828282,100305758903691183846,I had a Strep test which is very unpleasant because they swab your throat which makes you gag and it hurts. When the doctor swabbed my throat I naturally re flexed by grabbing her wrist tightly and pulling it back. She was very understanding although I did hurt her a bit probably. But they were all very helpful, comforting and, understanding of how distressed I was to have had Strep. Unfortunately it's been one month since and I have to go in again for Strep, luckily I think the doctor will be ready this time. P.S. to all you Soccer mom's out there with sick kids who go shopping and decide to touch everything which results in germs and viruses being spread...WASH YOUR HANDS! Because I wash mine and yet I'm spending Christmas sick and unable to celebrate it.]
