[104429055145827529019,100715850416632132929,Just bought a Colt LE6920. Really was surprised at the negative reviews because my dealings with these guys were top-notch. Fast and friendly service. After a lot of research and shopping around, even at the Indy gun show, these guys still beat the price by at least $200 dollars from anywhere else I found. I absolutely will be purchasing another firearm from these guys in the near future.]
