[109527542158321898717,100977038332416418018,I just moved near a price "smart" and I'm disturbed by their prices. a package of Bologna is $6. I regularly find items at 3x the price of other grocery stores. Their labeling is also deciving. I can't imagine how much food expires on their shelves. If you want to triple your grocery bill, shop here!]
