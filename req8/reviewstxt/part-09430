[103297279768677444209,100662366701281221581,My experience at B's Barber Shop has always been great. I look forward to my appointments. Each cut or color I get is done perfectly the way I want it. The atmosphere is always positive and friendly. Brad and his family are welcoming and fun. I would recommend this place again and again!!]
