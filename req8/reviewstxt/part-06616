So we tried some of those and they were great. I had Galina Cofreal, grilled chicken breast cooked in Goan spices, and it was two whole breasts. That's a lot of chicken. But the side dishes were the best bit. The Paneer Masalader was very good and the Aloo Anar Kali (stuffed potato, raisin, mash potato & green peas simmered in tomato gravy) was, well just weird ... but very fine. Recommended.]
