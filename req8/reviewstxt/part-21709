[107865142807505434515,100151210253059495071,The place is disgusting. The first full day of my stay, I had to spend cleaning this room in order to make it livable. The kitchen was a mess. My bed has big nasty stains all over it and there are cigarette holes in the mattress cover. The carpet looks like it's never been cleaned and it, too, is covered in cigarette burns and spots. The carpets throughout the building are disgusting with huge stains all over them. The bathroom tub backs up every week and maintenance says this happens regularly. There is dog filth every where on the grounds. The "high speed" wireless internet is anything but high speed. It takes two minutes to watch a 30 video clip. On two occasions, late at night, I've found one of the exit doors propped open with a stone allowing all sorts of bugs and pests to come into the building and posing a serious security threat. I have had to have my refrigerator replaced 4 times! They also seem to have a different rate policy for minorities than they do for whites. I met several people here who have been here for months (some even years believe it or not) and they were able to negotiate an extended 'annual' rate, yet when I asked for the same rate, I was told they no longer offer it. How convenient. This place isn't worth any money, though. If you can afford it, stay at the Marriott in the same complex. On a positive note, their staff member Glenn is a great guy. Glenn is dependable, always here (unlike their MIA manager), always courteous, helpful, empathetic, and an advocate for the guests who stay here. If it were not for Glenn, my stay here would be completely intolerable. I don't fault the staff members (some of them are really nice folks) for the state of this place. I fault corporate who obviously think it's more important to make money than provide a clean, safe, and memorable stay for their guests.]
