[113105303886907165433,100344272442540182809,Ever since I put on my first pair of pants from Public Myth, i was hooked! The Bamboo Pockets pants are SO incredibly comfortable to wear at the gym or out and about. I get complements on them EVERY TIME I wear them (ladies, the pockets are magic, i swear because they make your butt look curvy and sexy! Every item that I have bought in the last couple years have fit great and most important, they wash great! The fit doesn't change and the colours don't fade. This makes me happy because some of the colours that items come in are SO GORGEOUS (Purple Haze, Princess, and Sunshine to name a few) and it would be disappointing if they did fade! The customer service response time online has always been less than 24 hours. I have only bought this line from Reflex stores and the staff have been very friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that the Reflex stores don't always carry the sizes that I need - but now that i know what fits I can just get it online. A bit on the pricey side - but worth it! great for the gym, yoga, walking the dog, or hanging with friends... the legging would even be awesome to wear on a date!! If you are a 'Lulu Lover' then i am confident you will fall in love with PM - great quality, unique style and clothing that you can LIVE your life in! gym, grocery shopping, yoga... i heart Public Myth!]
