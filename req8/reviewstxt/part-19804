[110638920236183648945,100049789972572010049,I just rented the storage unit last night and when I returned with the truck to unload the truck, the gate code did not work. We had to leave. I called the office this morning and she checked the records and went outside and tried my code and it indeed did not work. She found it hadn't downloaded to the gate system. She was very cordial and helpful. I would suggest, however, that you check the code while they are still in the office to make sure it doesn't happen to you.]
