[103875949405583707233,100887121765682810896,Went over and beyond!!! Great service. Stayed late to get me back on the road after a break down on the Suncoast Tollway. Did his BEST to help out a complete stranger, tried to save me a car rental, but no, I had to do it my way. Worked WAY past normal hours. Just drove two hours home so the problem is fixed, at a reasonable rate. HIGHLY recommend his business ethics and his work.]
