[108787189573545479669,100855988655679571831,I work for a builder, and I had a client drive by Apex one day and stop to walk around their yard. My client called and told me I had to visit, so I made the hour long drive to Sealy to have a look and I was pleasantly surprised. There aren't very many stone yards that go to the trouble to install the stone in such a way that you get a real feeling for the final install. Apex has a beautiful yard that goes past sample walls which really helps people who need help visualizing their final look. They did take a little while to come out and check on us, but nothing outrageous, and they were very helpful in explaining the varieties and options on the stone. They also provided us with addresses of homes or companies that had used the particular variety of stone my clients were interested in so that we could go and see the product installed. I have had no problems with either customer service, or delivery, and I would recommend Apex to any of my future clients.]
