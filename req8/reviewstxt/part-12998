[111111208993588691125,100856916671419853763,My first visit was very nice. The rest of my visits where not good at all! I started going in March 2012, things where done wrong it was all obvious to everyone, they tried to correct them and now it's December and my teeth are still not right and they want to charge me more to make them correct! Please do some research before you go here, give me a call and I'll be glad to tell you about my experience! Sincerely Sandra]
