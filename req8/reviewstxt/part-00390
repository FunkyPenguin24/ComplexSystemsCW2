[103900324696394688623,100179396035139518778,If you like high pressured, low life, deceptive sales practice your are in the right place. Corals Springs Auto mall is king of the "Bait and Switch" low life sales tactics. I had the dis-pleasure of accompanying a friend of mine to see a used car at the Kia division. I met with Gary Chin-Sang whom first tried to not give us his last name undermining my intelligence saying its too hard to pronounce. He gave us to a sales guy who took us for a test drive. The drive was fine, we cam back and the pressure began. From one sales men to the next "You must by now" we can not hold it while you think about it. We just asked for a minute to confer with each other, but they would not let up. We asked Gary i he could hold the car for 4 hours while we go home or the tag he said no. Someone was their to purchase the car if we do not take it now it was sold. I told him we sould leave a deposit, Gary said that is not allowed. I asked why was was the customer service so terrible, his reply was that he owes the other person buying the car good customer service too. Before I could catch my breath after his appalling comment, yet another sales men walks by and said it sold. We had our limit and walked out. ************* PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN ****************]
