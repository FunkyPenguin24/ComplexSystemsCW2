[105259419585497061137,101153861857624207627,I had a wonderful experience getting my braces at this place! Dr Dillingham and his team are really good at what they do. All my appointments were always on time, they sent me reminders about the appointments and scheduled additional ones readily if I had to come in to get something fixed. In two years, I only had trouble with my wires twice and it was fixed immediately. My teeth look great and the Damon braces system worked really well. I am really happy!]
