[105761708060347076318,100084436774296063274,I went today around 2:00 and ordered Kung Pao Chicken and chicken wings. Both were dry and terrible -- did not taste fresh; more like reheated. The chicken wings were hard and had dried black blood on them. Usually I order chicken chow mein at Oriental restaurants, but noticed two almost full plates of it on an empty table when we walked in, so figured that must not be good. I wondered if they had perhaps just warmed up in the oven what was leftover from the buffet earlier.... maybe we came at the wrong time? I did not eat my meal, and was afraid to order another. At least was not charged for it. The plastic cup I drank out of also had two chips in it and were sharp on my mouth. I told the waiter about it and he didn't seem to give a s---. I suggested he retire the glass. My friend ordered sweet & sour chicken; she said it was OK but did not have much flavor. We will not be visiting this place again.]
