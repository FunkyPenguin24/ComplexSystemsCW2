[103945368141242793479,100945480780058361745,I have been there a quite a few times since they opened. I have never had any complaints regarding this restaruant. The place is spotless, everywhere! The employees are normal people who are very plesent and not robots with lines they practice. The food, well I have to admit, I have had only the stuffed meat pizza as it is awesome and could very well be its own food group. Will easily feed 4 for just over $20 bucks and everybody will be full. They sell slices so one can snack or have a less expensive lunch then just ordering an entire pizza. Sodas in cans and bottles is nice as I prefer no fountain drinks. They do have fountain drinks if that works for you. Its really a nice place to dine in, take out. I honestly do not remember if they deliver as I live kind of far away to be in their delivery area but I believe they do.]
