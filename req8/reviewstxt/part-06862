[110845413440278626560,100525279016049609152,I have an iPad 2 that was damaged by both a fall down 20 marble steps and a complete shattering of the glass. The great folks at JCD Repair fixed the glass in a jiffy and in the process, removed some of the dents and fixed the volume toggle (which was damaged front he first fall down the stairs). Excellent work done quickly - will repair any of my devices with them without hesitation.]
