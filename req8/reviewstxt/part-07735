[110314923981027446854,100573403187200224310,My order wasn't the problem. The problem was that when I pulled up to the window and after the window lady handed me my drink I overheard (and watched) her ask "What is wrong with the machine?" It was apparent that the soda mchine had acted on it's own and started randomly pouring drinks, to which the drive thru attendant put cups down for. -No problem right?- WRONG. The manager proceeds to grab each drink, pour them out and then re-stack them in the cups that are to be served in the future. I was not only so mad to call them to try to get the manager's name (with little avail because the line is currently busy), but am also disgusted with the service they are going to provide future customers. -Mike]
