[107397076177747702339,100270566246848738383,Very impressed with the way my car looks now. It looks almost brand new even though it is 6 years old. I will definitely have K & C Solutions Auto Detailing detail my car again before selling it in 3-4 years to buy my retirement car. The work is excellent, the service was fast, friendly and fantastic. I even came back 15 minutes after the detailing and they fit me right in to get buffing done. If you're going to have the detailing done, go the extra little bit and have your vehicle buffed as well. It really made a difference. I highly recommend going to these great guys to have your vehicle detailed.]
