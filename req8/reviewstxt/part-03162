I think I might have spent 20 minutes there, tops and they did everything. Checked my car from end-to-end, did all the maintenance that needed to be done... It was remarkable! The guys there are super nice. They vacuum the floors for free! I love it. I'll definitely be going back there for my next oil change and other maintenance.]
