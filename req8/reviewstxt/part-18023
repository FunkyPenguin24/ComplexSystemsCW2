[117763461610529157750,101130817318182439469,One of my favorite things about Taste is the atmosphere. While it's an upscale restaurant it doesn't feel stuffy. It's a calm, cool place to sit with the girls, have some fun cocktails and talk! It's such a great place all year around, but during the summer it's awesome to have a place to sit outside and relax after work with live music and of course one of Taste's many amazing cocktails. There's so many places to wine and dine in Albany but between the food and drink selections, the great service and personable employees Taste has something that many restaurants do not. it's a combination of the right location, the menu and the atmosphere that truly makes this a dining experience Taste is a unique upscale restaurant that draws a classy crowd but still maintains a casual feeling atmosphere. I can enjoy the perks of a nice place while still being able to "let loose," and unwind from a long day.]
