[104829411882296484550,100112206025457844511,I just recently leased a Volkswagon GLI from Maquire. I had an extremely pleasant buying experience with my sales consultant Kirk Barker. I was not forced into any car or group of cars that were out of my price range and or did not fit the criteria that I was looking for. Kirk did a tremendous job of narrowing down the various features and requirements that I was looking for in a vehicle and helped me to locate a selection of three different cars that may suit all of my needs. After I selected the perfect car, it was apparent that Kirk was not focused on getting the most money for his dealership, but rather doing his best to help me the customer. Overall the experience was great and me and my girlfriend will continue to do business with Kirk and the Maquire dealership in the future.]
