[115491136259310522369,100576139327756081823,Bel Red was called to my home for a gall furnace service (change filters, etc.), but the serviceman tallied up $1700+ in repairs, but said I really need a new furnace. My house is only 10 years old. After he walked out the door, I tried to turn my furnace on, and it would not work. I paid him for the service call only - something wasn't right. I then called Bob's Heating & A/C. They sent a serviceman who found wires to the blower had been disconnected and left dangling. Nothing else needed to be done. Nothing else faulty with the furnace. I gladly paid another service charge to Bob's Heating - they saved me the cost of a new furnace. I am an older, single lady and I believe Bel Red was clearly taking advantage of me. Be smart, get a second opinion.]
