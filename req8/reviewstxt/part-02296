[101832951353703670194,100277453234959148405,In a world where people use Google as a forum to complain about everything, I figured I would buck the trend and say something positive. Our first trip to Jake's was today for Sunday brunch. The food was very good for a 15 dollar per person brunch. It had both breakfast and dinner items on the bar. Sunday all you can eat brunch and football on the TV, whats not to like. We will be back.]
