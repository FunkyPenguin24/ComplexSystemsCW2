[103566696478951140067,100299266042812476654,I visited ARG today for the first time in several years. I travel frequently throughout the US and often visit local gyms for a quick boulder or lead session. ARG is a little hard to find because there is no sign out front. However the google maps directions are accurate. The hours are really limited. I am shocked that they don't open until 3 pm. While $15 is pretty standard pricing for a day pass, I found the gym in a sorry state of repair. The carpeted floor was torn in many places. It hasn't been vacuumed in weeks or more. The bathroom clearly doesn't get daily cleaning. There were ample route and problems selections (V0-V8). There were few hard problems, but that is fine if you just want a workout. I am very surprised that Austin doesn't have a competing gym given it's size in 2014.]
