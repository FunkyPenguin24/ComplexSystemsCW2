[101666152855017233879,100057432303462646074,Thought the car was too good to be true....... three months later...it was. I'm getting ahead of myself. Found AutoTrek through my credit union and decided to take a look at what the had online. I found something I liked so I talke to someone about it. She seemed enthusiastic for me to come check it out but as soon as I got down there and she saw that I am young (20's) she immediately started grilling me about money before I even had a chance to take a good look at the car and continued until she saw my credit score and my co-signers yearly income. Despite her rudeness I bought the car along with an extended warranty (big mistake). Here I am 3 months later facing $1200.00 to fix this so called "clean" car which by the way had a quarter tank of gas and dirty carpet when the gave it to me. Turns out first extended warranty only covers things if they are completely broke and do not work at all which apparently does not cover worn out breaks or a bad battery. Long story short; THEY SOLD ME A LEMON!!!!!!]
