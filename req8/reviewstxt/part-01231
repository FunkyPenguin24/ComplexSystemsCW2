[108890029596156089988,100222808354524569309,This is the best charter I have ever been on. We caught a shark and a sailfish on the same half day deal! My kids fed the tarpon on the way in and we were so excited. The crew was the best, Captain Lige and Chaz were so fun and professional. I would recommend this to everyone.]
