[101343968121535421819,100898519674419148184,I went in to visit Dr. Fabbiano with very bad neck and back pain. After a few treatments my pain was reduced about 50%. I have now been going to Dr. Fabbiano for about 2 months and my pain in BOTH my neck and back are completely GONE!! He is a miracle worker and really knows his stuff. I had been to chiropractors before and the experience at those particular offices didn't even compare to what you get at Valrico Spine and Rehab Center. From the moment you walk in the entire staff is amazing. Dr. Fabbiano takes time and explains each and every joint, bone or muscle that is not in the right place and then tells you what he is going to do to help you. He then gives you a regimen of what you can do at home to help yourself even more. Dr. Fabbiano really knows his stuff!!! I will continue to go to Valrico Spine and Rehab and will continue to refer everybody I know that has any kind of pain. Thank you!]
