[110877374975890504632,100278307919648046923,My overall experience at Uptown Vision was great! They take any insurance and utilize it fully. I was interested in Rayban, eddie bauer, etc and all other places i contacted that carry these frames only offered discounts through the insurance. A young lady by the name of Bridgitte helped me when I went in and she made my experience wonderful. She helped me choose what looked good on me and you could tell she was giving you honest feedback. Sweet gal. She also followed up as soon as my glasses came in. Great Place with lots of options on frames. Customer Service was awesome!!!]
