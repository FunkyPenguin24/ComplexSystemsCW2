[106778636609512626821,100146571779031108581,Burgers were very good. The chili was also delicious as were the desserts with portions big enough for about 2 to 3 people. Service was okay but in their defense the location was near closing. The waitress was pleasant but at times a little absent. Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend.]
