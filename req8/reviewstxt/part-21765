[101355569735458838809,100154270414636154520,When this car wash first opened I was very satisfied and the automatic tire shine worked well and my car was dried properly. Now the automatic tire shine does not work (although the light blinks falsely) and the tire shine sprayed by hand which was done too quickly, caused massive spots all over my 3 piece chrome wheels. I had to clean the wheels myself and apply tire shine as well. Then I found spots all over both doors and also on the rear quarter panels. I see here someone who has used both places in LC indicated the other Daddyo's on Lohman Ave is better. I guess I will give that a try. I tried to call the car wash today on Saturday to report this but no one answered the phone.]
