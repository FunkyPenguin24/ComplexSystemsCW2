[111177360221286345058,100790012830473304006,The thing I have always hated to do was to visit a car lot. Any car lot! However, I recently visited Texas Direct to look for a new car for a friend who lost theirs in a fire. I was overwhelmed by the vastness of this place! Brian Starnes was my salesman and he was awesome! He was very knowledgeable and made my experience a very smooth one. And, I'm not sure what I appreciated most, his patience, since I didn't really know what car I wanted to look for, or that he didn't creep out my girlfriend. :) Would definitely go back! Oh, if you're a muscle car freak like me, you have to drop by to at least check out the rare American Motors Rebel. Worth the trip alone.]
