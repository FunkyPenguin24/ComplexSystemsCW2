[105439362534081687395,100689020469028382648,Great service, caring staff. Very different from other oil change places, much more valuable. I value great service, and am more than happy to pay more for it. I have no interest in the lowest price because you generally get average service at best -why would anyone want to work with a company who is doing everything in their power to get the lowest price, that means cutting corners... -not for me, I want things done right and I understand that high quality costs more. By the way they have deals on Groupon every once in a while for $19 -you can't beat that price -in fact, I don't understand how they can make any profit at that price! (note to owner: please don't price your stuff too low, I want you to be in business for a long time to come!) These guys know how to treat you right, if you appreciate that, then The Oil Exchange is your oil change home!]
