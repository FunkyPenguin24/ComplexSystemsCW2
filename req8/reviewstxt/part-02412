[115414766719222346089,100283415033946751049,I give 5 star, but it is a dentist office, and I loathe the dentist office, just because they are dentists offices, but that aside, I did have a very positive experience. The hygienist was pleasant and personable, and the dentist snuck in during the cleaning to take his mandatory look around, so that I didn't have to wait around after the full cleaning for him. I actually really liked that. My appointment was 10:15, I arrived right around 10:00, I was out by 11:00. The prompt care pleases me. They took care to advise me of costs in advance of care, which I also think is important. I also particularly like fish tanks in the waiting room, complete with clownfish (Nemo/Marlin) and pacific regals (Dory). I giggled.]
