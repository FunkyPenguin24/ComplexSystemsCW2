[103117142157412982049,101007026534314285703,From a fairly new student perspective, I would suggest and recommend Mr. Machado's RCJ Machado Jiu Jitsu. What you can expect? Great people and an open environment for learning. I drive from Rockwall and its worth it. For anyone considering learning a martial art for self defense, MMA, training, fitness or just spiritual progress - RCJ Machado is simply the best. Review from a real student who has made significant progress towards my personal goals. Thanks to the entire team.]
