[115548411245031818869,100475656961590676266,Scam!!! I would not trust them at all and would drive miles away for a car service. After moving from another state to FL, I googled several car service places. Since this place had a very good rating and it is so close to my work, I tried it. I was told that my car battery will need to be replaced SOON. Since this battery has 6 yrs warranty and it was less than 3 years old, I decided to ignore their recommendation. That was 6 months ago!!! After 6 months of driving, I still have no problem at all with my battery. I'm so glad that I considered their recommendation as a scam.]
