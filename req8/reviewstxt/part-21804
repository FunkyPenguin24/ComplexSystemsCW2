[102974898334818872980,100156493412537431352,HORRIBLE HORRIBLE AWFUL PLACE! Went there three years ago with my cat and thought they were overpriced and somewhat rude. Changed vets.... Returned Saturday morning with a very, very, very ill cat because they opened early and are close to home. The receptionist (male, sort of punk-rocky looking) first turned us away saying they had no appointments available... (Mind you, my cat was on the floor in a carrier with bad breathing issues and was not stable... NO ONE ASKED EVEN WHERE MY CAT WAS MUCH LESS IF SHE WAS IN STABLE CONDITION.) The RUDE receptionist said he would check with the doctors and see if he could fit us in. He left the reception area and came back about five minutes later. He told me to fill out some paperwork. I thanked him and asked what the doctors said, he replied, "Oh, I haven't had a chance to talk to them yet." (Again... still my cat was on the floor in a carrier with bad breathing issues and was not stable... Again, NO ONE ASKED WHERE MY CAT WAS MUCH LESS IF SHE WAS IN STABLE CONDITION.) I got upset and told the receptionist I was leaving and would never, ever consider bringing my animals (who are like family to me) to this place again. And I won't ever return! While I never thought VCA on Elston was the best place to take my animals for a possible serious issue (more of a shots kind of vet), I was proven wrong and my kitty was stabilized, treated, and sent home within an hour. VCA called me this morning to check on her! Thank goodness for vets like VCA who actually care about animals because CAT HOSPITAL OF CHICAGO SEEMED TO NOT CARE AT ALL ABOUT THE HEALTH OF MY CAT!]
