[112748227991682437974,101044052845261804584,TERRIBLE, NOISY, AND THEFT!!! - My wife and I spent the first weekend in December, 2011 there for a family function in the area and initially thought the place was nice. They were filming at the pool and told us to be quite. There was a funky smell in the hallways and the room had a unique odor. Breakfast was in a shabby room and was not up to par as nicer Residence or Hampton Inns. Place also looked dated. To add insult to injury, when we got home, my wife found that $1,200 of her jewelery and clothing was missing from her luggage. We called the hotel to complain and said they would check to see who took care of our room. We called back and they told us that the maid who cleaned our room had suddenly left for Cuba (for family issues). We asked them to reimburse us for the stolen items (we have receipts), they referred us to their insurance carrier (Certus Claims) who referred us back to the hotel. I complained to the hotel and they wouldn't speak to me anymore. Both refuse to pay for anything even though they basically admitted that their maid fled with stuff. I am going to have to sue them in small claims court. I thought the hotel maids are supposed to be bonded.]
