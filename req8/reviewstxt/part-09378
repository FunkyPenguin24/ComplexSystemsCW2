[111864082124593765475,100659665730143512661,I had a very positive experience at Mossy Nissan Kearny Mesa. I bought a 2011 Nissan Rouge and I LOVE it. The sales staff was very nice and accommodating. My salesman Bill was very kind and really helped me through the process of buying my very first car. We negotiated a great price and they were very flexible. I get so excited every time I get in my new Rouge, I love driving it!! I would highly recommended Mossy Nissan Kearny Mesa. It's also pretty cool how they take your picture after and put it online so you share with your family and friends!]
