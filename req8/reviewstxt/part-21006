[102483101618088226340,100112788365064086083,Great atmosphere, food, and waitstaff... I will definitely go there again. However, they seem to have a couple of hostesses with really poor attitudes. One of them had the audacity to ask if we were "actually going to order dinner" after we had been seated at our table for a little bit enjoying appetizers and drinks with friends. Since when is that an appropriate question?]
