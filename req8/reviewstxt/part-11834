[104483591224002784013,100792430532115381117,My family was in town for a funeral, and we stopped in due to its location and great reviews on yelp. We were a bit skeptical at first because it literally looks like a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint, but we were pleasantly surprised once the food came. Great food, great service and the atmosphere wasn't bad. I would give this a 5 if it weren't from the outward appearance and lack of parking. The place was slammed but we got in and seated (8 of us) quickly. Some of the best Mexican I have had!]
