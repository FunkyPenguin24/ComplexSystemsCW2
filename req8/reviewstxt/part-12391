[109750244955213925245,100822794275331535422,By far the best first car buying experience I could've wished for! Tony Whiteman did a great job in finding the perfect car for my needs and then walked me through the process step by step so I understood what was going on. From the moment I walked into the door until I drove away in my first new car, Tony answered every question I had. I couldn't have asked for a better salesman! I would highly recommend to anyone (whether it's your first car or not) to drive over to Liberty Chevrolet and ask to see Tony Whiteman.]
