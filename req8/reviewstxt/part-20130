[111852756849977100117,100067016373919998993,I recently bought a 2012 Accord EX-L from Joyce Koons and I must say its been the best car buying experience I had ever had. Dexter Straker (Sales person) and Peter Stohlman (Sales Manager) made it very easy on me and it was completely hassle free. I was very impressed with how very accommodating they were when closing the deal. I couldn't help referring Joyce Koons to my friends and colleagues at work. One of my coworkers immediately bought a similar car on the very next day I had closed the deal on mine. I look forward to working with Joyce Koons in the future for my servicing needs --- Suneel Marthi]
