[110391396656588465437,100634519078575624343,Maga La Boheme is a very tiny but full of chic boutique in east Austin. I was happily greeted by Ashley today who helped me find a beautiful cream colored and lacy spaghetti strap summer dress that fits me perfectly. During checkout Ashley was very courteous and personable making me feel right at home in this fabulous local shop. Before I visited the storefront I had gone to the website to glimpse at the inventory. Honestly I thought the prices were a bit high. After visiting the store though I found that the prices are actually pretty reasonable. The sales are great! I'm not sure if the website has not been updated but don't let that deter you from visiting! I plan on making another trip to the east side soon.]
