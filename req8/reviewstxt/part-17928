[111584807411963186940,101124861850251003913,Always loved this office until I had to cancel an appointment for my husband because he came down with the flu. I was reprimanded for cancelling his appointment because I did not provide them with 48 hours notice. As I tried to reschedule, was told I must pay a $50 deposit before they would schedule an appointment. When I mentioned that I had dental insurance that covered our visits entirely, I was told I would get reimbursed. As a manager, this is not how you retain clients. It did not set well with me and I will no longer refer anyone to them. I have since changed dentists as this practice of ludacris charging is not the norm for others in the area. Thank you Dr. Hiers for forcing me to shop around and find a dentist that values mine and my family's business!]
