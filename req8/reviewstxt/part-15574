[107354193034594368301,100998211118752868480,I needed a last minute cleaning and I called about 10 different places before I found HQ cleaning Wow, I didn't know such top notch customer service existed in the Glasgow area. I went online to book HQ cleaners and yes, it truly is as easy as everyone says. Two ladies arrived 30 minutes early to my flat. They scrubbed and grunted and dusted like mad. I needed to get the place ready for picture taking because I was going to put it on the rental market. I needed a visible dirt cleaned up for the tenant prospectives. The ladies came with their own supplies and everything!! Made the whole process a breeze. No way -- I'm not even sure what I was thinking trying to clean the place myself. I'm so glad I found them while researching online and would definitely use them again..]
