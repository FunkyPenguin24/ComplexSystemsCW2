[102348794500141363826,100612523175418798635,In a 40 hour period comprising only one night in their hotel and only 7 hours in the room. With all the rest of my time on the floor gambling and they want to charge $11.00 per day for internet access. How low rent transparent can you get? The floor personel were fine..but whoever made that idiotic rule lost a customer. I don't believe having internet access is the deciding factor on whether I go to the floor to gamble. 4G is limited but available so their pathetic attempt at cost savings or manipulation is a mute point..but they did accomplish running me off to a casino that understands hospitality and amenities. Thanks Harrahs..your a class act.]
