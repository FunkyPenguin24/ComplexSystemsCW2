[108707027806790125491,100892790834279979471,This place was just what I needed. A long day of work on business here in Phoenix having come in from San Diego a day earlier. They had the substantive, flavorful beers I was looking for... hard to find when you're traveling and in a city you don't know. Had a G'Night Imperial Red double IPA... in. a. m-fing can... which is unusual, but quite tasty. And the chipotle cheese steak was on point. Nice subtle flavors in there along with the flavorful cheese steak with the nice, salty homemade chips. nice conversations over a sweet 90's to 2000+ hip-hop soundtrack... chatting with the locals including the owner's wife, bartender and co-manager as well as trinidadian-venezuelan hip-hop producer @mackdrama. In Phoenix? Hit up the Main Ingredient.]
