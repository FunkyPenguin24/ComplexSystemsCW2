I did appreciate the queso blanco, instead of the typical cheese-like product usually offered, but even this wasn't enough to make it worth it. I don't recommend this place to anyone. Just because it looks authentic and has Goya Products, doesn't mean its good. On a side note, having lived more than 20 years in Texas and having lived and traveled throughout Mexico, I can say that this is the only place that I ever got food poisoning, after eating here I vomited several times.]
