[109518303171126376657,100175888970384750297,I absolutely miss this place. I moved away from Colorado back to Phoenix 2 years ago and wish they had a Pahgre's here. The owner is awesome, gave away food on Christmas AND DELIVERED IT! Absolutely the best meatballs I've ever had. If you have a problem, bring it to his attention, he will straighten it out! One of the friendliest people I have ever met. Thank you so much.]
