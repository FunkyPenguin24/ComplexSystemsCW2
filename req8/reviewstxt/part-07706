[112050816115271910733,100571707506461954614,We both wanted to write to say thank you for the amazing photos you have taken for us. We were both a little nervous on our first "photoshoot" haha but you made us relaxed and we all enjoyed the session. More importantly you worked so well with our son Sam who was only 6 months old and can be a handful. The photos are amazing and have sealed in some fond memories and we will be having some updated photos with you later this year. Thanks again.]
