[101726960082144342798,100827066506668446735,I have a 98 Toyota Camry and the transmission had completely went out on my husband on his way to the grocery store. I have an extreme attachment to this car and was not going to trust it to just anyone. I mean this is the car that I bought new and all three of my children learned to drive in this car, so it was like family and very reliable. I went in to see my mechanic to find out what it would take to fix my Camry. I was so surprised at his response when he actually told me "If you want it done right, with a great price and back in a few days, take it to Best Western at Citidal". I have a great mechanic and he knows the family and the car. I trust his opinion and he has never failed us when it come to this car. Not only that, he told me this with another customer right there and that customer totally agreed with him as he shared his experience with Best Western. To make a long story short, we wound up calling Best Western to get a quote for a rebuild on the transmission and they were actually comparable if not better than all of the other quotes in the city. They came out that night and towed our car to there shop at no extra charge and Jesse kept us informed every step of the way in this repair. Something I thought was great is that when we went to pay for it, it was the price they had quoted us. WOW, that never happen when getting the car fixed, it is always more. Not only that, we were told to bring it back in for no charge when the car reached 100 plus miles so they could check it out and make sure there were no problems with fluids and such. I am so happy that we decided to take our car to Best Western. Thanks Jesse and crew for your honesty, compassion and diligent work, the Camry is back on the road and drives like it always did. I highly recommend them if you are in need of a transmission repair.]
