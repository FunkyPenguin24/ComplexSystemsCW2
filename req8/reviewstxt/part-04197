[101760876478973802783,100381518642123976252,. We checked into the Internatonal Palms resort wednesday August 15th. We were excited by the hotels pictures. Upon arriving we were happy with the apperance of the room but thought the placement of our room felt more like a college dorm. There were unruly teenages running up and down the hallway kncking on the doors at all hours of the night. Wen I woke up in the middle of the night found some roaches in the bathroom and didnt think much of it because it happens. However the next morning our crossaints which were in a tight plastic container had 4 roaches inside of them. There were roaches all behind our TV. I took the box of crossaints to the front desk and complained- we were given a voucher for a free breakfast. While we were at the pool there was roaches crawling around the side of the pool. The last straw came when I awoke that night with two roaches in our bed. I called front desk to complain and asked the staff named Ahmed if I could have corporaes number. He stated there was not a number to corporate and that he was the manager on call. He stated he could move me to another room but if I didnt like that room that there were plenty of other rooms in other hotels in Orlando. So at 1230am I packed up my two small children and changed rooms to another building. That room also had roaches in the tub. We went out and bought roach spray because we didnt want to pack up and move our children again. Upon checking out we discovered that Ahmed was not a manager and that all they could do was discount our resort fees. I wouldnt stay here again or even recommend it. The positive is that the atrium building had a great view of Harry Potter and Sebastian at the front desk was very helpful with checkin and they do have great discount park ticket prices. but overall It was a horrible experience and not happy with how Ahmed at front desk treated us]
