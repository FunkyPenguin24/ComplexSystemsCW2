[107438270399711563920,100043047401490069052,This restaurant was very pricey but satisfactory. 3 people with entrees, drinks, and 1 dessert cost approximately $90. The restaurant is located well, close to the entrance to scenic attractions near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The staff is very knowledgeable about their offerings and extremely polite. There is live piano music as entertainment that I enjoyed as well. The food was very well done and my parents couldn't find anything unsatisfactory to say about the restaurant (trust me, this is a first).]
