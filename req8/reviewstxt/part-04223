[107314203002670044703,100383134465737157541,My husband and I drove from Yukon over to Red Coyote today to look for me some running shoes , we walked in the store and there were 2-3 people behind the counter and 2 people on the floor. We walked in and not one person said Hi, Hello or Welcome not even a nod!!! Went over to the running shoes and looked at them for about 15 mins and no one even approached us not even to say "we will be with you in a moment" or anything. This was my first and last visit to this store, I had read great reviews about the store and thought this would be the perfert place to help me find the perfect running shoe, but ......I was wrong!! Oh well I guess I had to try!!! Brenda Hooper]
