[113418965034869060426,101056708753239744188,Waiting on a lawn mower that was getting their basic tune up package. It has been in for two weeks, with a max finish date of 5-17. Called to see what was up with it and it has not even been looked at yet...simple oil change and filter and blade sharpening. Gonna spend as much having somebody mow my lawn in this amount of time that I am on the repair. Not happy, probably won't use Sears again.]
