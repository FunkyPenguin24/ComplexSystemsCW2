[102050522640752458643,100320108359697763822,Terrific tour of the distillery and a great place to grab an Irish Coffee prepared the RIGHT way. Surprised that they they turn out such a great product with only 300 employees. Only wish I could have fit several bottles in my returning luggage, especially the "only available here" whiskey.]
