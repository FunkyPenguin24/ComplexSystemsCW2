[105881866903059588629,100284687195647010589,Marcus Brown helped my husband and I buy our first house six years ago. He was helpful, patient, and professional. He recommended an outstanding inspector and even helped us locate the best price to have the floors refinished before we moved in. Fast forward to this summer, and Marcus helped us sell our first house. He found a fabulous home photographer who showcase our house's best assets, helping us get three offers the first weekend it was on the market! He helped us navigate through the inspections, coached us on the offer/counter offer procedures, and counseled us on working with the tenants who were currently renting our home. He even negotiated to have our furnace repaired! Selling a house can be a daunting process, but with the help of Marcus Brown, this was the best possible experience for us. We extremely appreciated his attention to detail, willingness to go above and beyond, and professional manner. If we buy a house in the Portland area again, we will most definitely use Marcus Brown Properties as our Realtor. Nicole Heinlein]
