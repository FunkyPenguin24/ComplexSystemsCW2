[100727215299924976122,100989085298182221194,Great customer service but i"ve been here a couple of times already and have gotten a gel manicure and next day it started peeling off. I had to go back to get it redone. Another time I came and got a pedicure and same day the whole nail polish just chipped off and some others started chipping off as well. I went back the next day and they were giving me a hard time with redoing it, said they would charge me extra because it wasnt gel polish and that it's It's likely to chip off. This is like the 3rd time this has happened to me.]
