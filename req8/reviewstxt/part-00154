[103532847881961836816,100166780398899422196,Walking distance from my house AND they have female doctors! What could be better? Except maybe receptionists who don't reschedule me 3 separate times because "the other receptionist booked me in an unavailable spot". Or maybe it would be nice if the doctor made eye contact with the patient and acted as if they cared at all about your health or well being instead of being about as cold and unresponsive as a dead fish. Like another reviewer, I requested a flu shot in addition to the complaint that I came in for. The doctor jabbed me and left the room without saying anything. It was over so fast that I wasn't even positive that she had done it at all and certainly didn't seem concerned about keeping me around to make sure I didn't have a negative reaction. Granted I haven't seen every doctor at this clinic, only the Russian doctor (sorry, I don't remember her name), but I feel like if I had been there for a chemical peel, I might have been treated better . . .]
