[101124176969695129888,100278153207788181029,I can't say about the food because I didn't stay for it. The restaurant was dead when I walked in. Only one occupied table. The host was in a corner with his back to the door, on his phone. I know the cook saw me, we made eye contact twice, but neither greeted me or acknowledged my existence. I left after 3-5 minutes of this horrible service.]
