[118246802556277331045,100925410008442692361,My 5 and 7 year olds participate in the after school program and I could not be more pleased. Everyone takes such good care of the kids. Whether they are doing their homework, taking a class, or playing, they are in a warm constructive environment. They are learning lifes skills: courage, perseverance, self-discipline, and determination. I consider the staff at HK Lee as part of a team that includes all the important adults my childrens' lives.]
