[115048551543488687199,100223606503736213969,My visit to the office was okay but my experience with the dr was poorly done, there was a few questions and he was gone and i was out to the door, very impersonal. I felt the doctor didn't understand just how bad i felt and didn't even offer pain medicine since i was informed regular pain killers would cause more issues and problems with my liver and kidney. I had to ask the receptionist if the doctor was going to give me something for the pain. The day of the ultrasound the tech said they found significant findings at 10am. I went the whole day without a phone call from the doctor or nurse as to my condition. Had to wait the whole weekend and first thing Monday at noon i call and i'm told that it's notated on my chart that a nurse would call me AFTER all of his other patients were taken care of. So another 5 hours go by and I've still not received news on what the doctor is going to do about my gallbladder, and now I have to wait until Tuesday to call them again.I'm very disappointed in the way they have treated me. It's as if i'm just another paycheck for his office and nothing more. I don't recommend anyone to deal with his office unless they want to be given the run around about their condition.]
