[113314571580599439308,100840143275904656670,I wave been looking for a great plumber to help us out with our home in Murrieta. I found Dana's Plumbing from a friend who had used them in the past and said they were an excellent plumbing contractor. I decided to give them a call. They showed up on time and got right to work. I had previously had another plumber come in to our house in Murrieta to do some drain cleaning. They only stayed for about 30 minutes and charged us for a full hour. With Dana's this was not the case. They had explained to me the root problem of my plumbing problems was some blocked up pipe passages and that if I did not replace the existing plumbing it would result in a burst pipe or possible flooding. They fixed the problem immediately and were very affordable. I highly recommend Dana's plumbing to anybody in the Murrieta and Temecula area.]
