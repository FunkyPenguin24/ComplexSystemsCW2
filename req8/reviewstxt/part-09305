[108292859009247963134,100655771785124617788,Ruby Tuesday is hands down the best restaurant I have been to in Mt. Pleasant. The Atmosphere was phenomenal, the Food was perfect, and the Value was amazing. This is the only place I have ever tipped 50% but the service was fantastic and deserved every penny of it.]
