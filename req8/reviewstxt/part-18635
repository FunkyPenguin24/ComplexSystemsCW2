[115735635649252893734,101163189432185093004,Always eat at Commander's Restaurant for years! They have the BEST lemon rice soup around! The service is good and the menu selection is great! I've had many different things on the menu and also love to eat their baked mac & cheese on Friday's! Their saganaki is also great, order it almost every time I go there. The environment has changed since it is now smoke free and the place always seems to be packed with people. The pricing is very reasonable also. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who wants to stop by for a quick meal that is reasonably priced.]
