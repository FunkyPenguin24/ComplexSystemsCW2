[116785586250075966992,100451862776100043626,From check in to check out my girlfriend and I had a terrible experience. Personally I felt disgusted in the way the hotel manager conducted himself whenever there was an issue or complaint (never apologetic or sympathetic - always angry and threatening). The room was only cleaned once from our 3 night stay, and the noise from the hallways was enough to keep anyone awake all night - thin walls and poor construction. The customer service at this hotel is beyond disgusting - I barely complain and see myself as an optimist, although after staying at this hotel, I wanted to leave the minute I arrived. Almost ruined our holiday.]
