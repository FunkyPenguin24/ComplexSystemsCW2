[117633379114166487798,100914361387338173373,In Sept I put money down on very specific Audi in Seattle. The dealer stalled me, pushed out the delivery date past the date that my very good financing would have lapsed. When I pointed out that other dealers had the exact car I was looking for, they did little to help connect me with the Audi of my dreams. Then came Travis and Jacob of Wilsonville Audi. Found the white Audi TTS that I was looking for - about three hours south of Seattle in Oregon. They helped me work out the deal with my bank in a matter of hours over email. They responded to emails quickly. They found great discounts that I didn't know I was eligible for - like the Audi Loyalty discount. The next day I took the train from Seattle to Portland and Travis picked me up at Union Station - he's a sweety! Within an hour, I was out the door with my brand new Audi TTS and off to visit a friend in the area. Travis and Jacob did a great job to get me the car I wanted with the features I wanted. They were supportive and helpful.]
