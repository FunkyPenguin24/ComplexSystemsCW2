[106187185740928026336,100962143296652208076,I met with Luke for an initial swing consult. Luke is young, but understands the fundamentals of golf and I believe is able to articulate them to a player of any skill level. We spent a good amount of time reinforcing swing mechanics and discussing things such as grip, hands, pivoting and following through. Naturally, all of that was reinforced with the robot. After one lesson I could feel my thought changing as I was on the course, so the benefits of the lesson in my opinion were immediate. I was already putting to work tips I learned with my time with Luke. I would recommend Luke and the Tour Bound Golf Academy to anyone looking for a competitively priced lesson backed by expert analysis and modern technology. Given the weather fluctuations in Chicago, I also believe it easier to stay on track with my lesson plan given all instruction is done inside, no more 90 degree summers and 30 degree winters at Diversey Driving range.]
