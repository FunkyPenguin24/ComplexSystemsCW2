[106802531251749408340,101111785891879768713,I lived a few blocks away for a year and frequented this Thai restaurant more than any other establishment in at least a ten block radius. By far. And I mean every establishment, restaurants included. Bottom line: the Thai served here is quite impressive. I would have to recommend the Green Curry and also the Pad Thai, both of which are steals given the menu prices. The dine-in experience impresses as well. No frills, just clean decor and very attentive service. No matter where I live in the city for the years to come, I will always make an effort to keep returning to Lanna Thai. One of the best values I've known.]
