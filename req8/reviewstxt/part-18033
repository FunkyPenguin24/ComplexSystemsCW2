[118106367853151177497,101131466457454604180,There are thousands upon thousands of great dentists. Dr. Addario is one of them but this is not what distinguishes his practice from the millions of other dental care providers out there. He has an impeccable approach to each of his patients. He tailors his demeanor and treatment to each individual person as if they were just that, an individual. I can't begin to tell you how big of a difference this makes in healthcare. He has my utmost respect and gratitude. I and my family will be with Sunbow Dentistry for the rest of our lives.]
