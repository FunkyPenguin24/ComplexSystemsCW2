[110948868327776393357,101089041919200009128,On Bank Holiday Sunday my partner and I made a last minute booking here for 9:00pm and walked into a buzzing, bright restaurant! We booked here as having looked online at a few places and read the menu's etc this one appealed the most and we 100% made the right choice. We had a sharer to start, it included calamari, duck spring rolls, chicken skewers and thai fishcakes and it was sooooo tasty! That was the first tick in the box. For mains I had a rump steak, rare (cooked to perfection) and the other half had salt and pepper fajitas which he said were the nicest he had ever had, succulent and colourful. Second tick in the box! (I am hoping you are starting to see a pattern here) For desert the boy had trifle which was served in a glass pot so looked great and I am told was delicious and I had warm chocolate fudge cake and I can honestly say I have never eaten one in a restaurant as amazing as that! It was a perfect bank holiday night out, great food, great wine and the staff were friendly, funny and just added to the whole experience.]
