[103281851661211987397,100018113841614928108,My dog, Rico, was attacked, by bird or another animal, and we took him to Gulf Coast. My husband and daughter took my baby Rico ( Maltese) to this clinic and they were told that his prognosis was very good. I was out of town but felt confident that he would be okay and be home in about 4 days. Little did I know that soon after I would get a desperate call from my daughter that Rico is not breathing and we had to put him down. We spent over $5000 to fix my baby only to loss him. If we had been told the truth from the beginning that he would probably not make it we would not have put him through the suffering he had to go through. I feel that this clinic was not upfront about the severity of his injuries, costing me thousands and my poor Rico hours of suffering. No matter how much you love your pet, make sure you are told the truth and put your baby down with NO suffering than pay these vet doctors thousands and your baby suffers and still you loss him/her. Sorry to say, but I would not recommend this vet office.]
