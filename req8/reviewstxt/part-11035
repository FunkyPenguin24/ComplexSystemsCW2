[107995218367988140673,100749803907398403389,my most memorable times at Bogarts was seeing Type O Negative in Oc.'09 and this February seeing Meshuggah...it's a really cool little venue, i haven't been to many places for concert but of the maybe 5 i've been to i like Bogarts the best. what wins me over is the atmosphere and the bouncer,i usually get to the very front on the left side (and i'm a tiny little 4'10" girl), the bouncer and its always been the same one has always saved me from being crushed against the gate or if people try to push me out of my spot. props to that awesome guy :D]
