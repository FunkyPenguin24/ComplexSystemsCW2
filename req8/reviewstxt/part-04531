[115249436999358377881,100400415895061916261,After 20+ years of ALWAYS wanting to own a Tahoe, I finally can say I own one....thanks to Julie Gonzalez and Kenny Beavers. Julie went above and beyond to make sure my needs were met and make sure I got the best deal possible and MOST importantly I drove out of there with the truck of my dreams. I was able to drive out with a 2011 Tahoe with the warranty still in place AND for a VERY low price. I checked around and NO ONE could beat this deal. Kenny Beavers made certain my vehicle was delivered in top notch condition after making sure it was delivered from another Hendrix dealer a few hours away. I can't express how grateful I am to have had this experience and welcome the opportunity to work with you all in the future. Thank you again for such a pleasant experience. Sincerely, Leslie West]
