[100520467873136576894,101033715680001121295,If the title doesn't say it all, then hopefully I can clarify here. This place is like a bar/club. The serve food that is okay, but by no means great. It is about 30% more expensive than it ought to be. It's bar food (only not as tasty) served on nice platingwares. I might go here for a cocktail on the roof or something, but I'd never go here again w/ the intent on dining.]
