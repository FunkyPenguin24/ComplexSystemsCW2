[106081285070112680456,101137670032593635069,Cafe on The Square is the reason I hang in San Marcos before heading to class at Texas State University. I enjoy their independently-owned genre of eatery. COTS has great food with a huge variety of menu goodies. Between their free Wi-Fi and friendly service from attentive folks who love living in San Marcos--- I wish I could put the place in my pocket and travel.]
