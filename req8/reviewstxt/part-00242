[109286787764509964419,100171858055432676617,AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!!! Took in a car with 14,000 mi for a simple alignment. Very minor adjustment needed, Quoted 89.95. That is about $10 dollars too high, as if you do your research Sears and Mitch's Firestone are Cheaper. 1 hour later I went in to pay and take the car home. Once home I check the receipt and find a $9 shop fee no none mentioned....I am pretty upset and call questioning this 9 dollar fee. Well I was yelled at and told that there was fine print that I should have read, bullshit you tell me in the original quote there's 9 dollars added. So they offered a 9 dollar refund. Shady business practices are the only thing in this Kingdom, not to mention a mouthy scrub dressed as a car service person. Kiddos save your money and GO ELSEWHERE.
