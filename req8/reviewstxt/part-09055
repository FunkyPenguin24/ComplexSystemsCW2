[101133476255246753442,100641699289162202699,They are the worst. The owner is a real cheat. He screws electrical supply houses out of tens of thousands of dollars, refuses to play fair, doesn't return or answer phone calls, nasty and rude to many NYC building dept. authorities ( these authorities have confided with us about this many times) and he is known throughout the industry as someone to steer clear away from when doing business. I will withdraw this comment when he actually pays us what is rightfully owed. He randomly deducted close to 30 thousand dollars for a "Manufacturing" error and blamed us for this!! We just delivered the product!!! and.. the manufacturer asked us to sell their product to him.]
