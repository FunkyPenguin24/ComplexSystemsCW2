[112270566704843936274,100266004846658292133,Messy. We came during lunch on Saturday, so we expected it to be busy and it was.. This store seemed to be understaffed, unlike every other chick-fil-a we have been to (we have 3 others that we eat at pretty regularly). This location didn't seem to have anyone working the dining room consistently, which is why there was food and trash on the floor and dirty tables. Also, the underside of the table was so dirty that the table cover for my grand daughter wouldn't stick. We will not be back to this location.]
