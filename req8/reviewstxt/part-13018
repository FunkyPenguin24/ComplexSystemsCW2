[103605750920063375126,100857893709902670027,I was in a car accident in December of 2011 hit from behind what fun. After 3 months and 20 sessions of physical therapy at two differant places. I still had pain and swelling in my neck and shoulder. I found Dr Woodmansee on the internet, after three weeks of his chiropractic therapy at his Midvalley Clinic in West Jordan Utah I have no pain and the swelling has stopped. Wish I would have gone to Doctor Woodmansee in the first place. His office staff is very friendly and easy to work with.]
