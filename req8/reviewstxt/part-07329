[103994870777185589877,100550986980767521082,I took my bike in to get the front smaller gear straightened out because it has been bent over 3teeth and was causing the chain to slide off. They charged me $15, took three hours, and messed up the front derailleur such that when I rode it next the cable snapped. Not at all happy to know that another bike shop in town would have done it for ~$3, in minutes, and wouldn't have messed up probably. I am not going back.]
