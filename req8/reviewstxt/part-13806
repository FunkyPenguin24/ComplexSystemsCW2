There are many kid features, though it doesn't seem overrun with teenagers and small kids. It has many computers available too. It doesn't have a wifi area for people with laptops with fried batteries, i.e., there's no place to plug in and surf except one outlet in a lounge area, and that, for some of us, is a real sinker.]
