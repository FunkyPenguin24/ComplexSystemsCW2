[105563583909544128081,100269569065410658402,I have been seeing Dr. Tony now for about 4 months and my overall health has never been better. I went in to see him with some lower back pain I thought was from lifting my sons and sleeping on an old mattress. Within about 5 minutes he had found the cause and proposed a plan to alleviate it. With his help over the first month of altering my diet and getting tune-ups from Dr. Tony I felt great! He continues to provide excellent insight into my overall well-being and I am now a healthier and happier person because of it.]
