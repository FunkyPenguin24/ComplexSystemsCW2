[106434943328783570522,100980699720467031151,It does not matter what time of day the service is bad. When I go to the drive thru I have to repeat my order over and over it is a simple order med lite no sugar and med cream one sugar and they always screw it up and put sugar in the coffee that I order no sugar. I have gone into to complain they say the manager or owner are not there and they dont have a phone number for them. I have left my name and number for the owner to call me I never get a call.I give up and I know alot of people who have the same complaint. So we just give our business to Braintree DD. So be aware if you go here you will get so agravated before your morning nd coffee and drive away and take a sip a of coffee and find out they screwed up your order again grrr!!!77]
