[114822979887190730100,100112983451731127354,I re-certified myself for my Massage Therapy license. So, this was the third time taking this style of class. Not looking forward to the repeat material I went in thinking this was going to be super boring. Well, in fact the class was the best one I've taken so far! The instructor was a paramedic and explained right away how the next two hours would be. We watched all the videos, pausing between each session to answer questions and clarify anything that was needed. There were only 6 of us in the class which made practicing on the dummies very efficient. Our instructor made sure each of us were practicing properly, adjusting hand placements and explaining how to use your body weight to give CPR. I would highly recommend Saving Chicago CPR to anyone looking to become certified in CPR.]
