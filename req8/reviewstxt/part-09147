[110015730659511874236,100646554854590693456,I have stayed in the Solaris at Vail 3 times now, and I cannot begin to express how amazing this place is! Combine the excellent treatment that you receive upon arrival with the prime location in the heart of Vail Village, this place is hard to beat. The views of the front side of the mountain are spectacular! One gentleman, David from Elevation Resorts could not have been more helpful when helping me choose a residence for my family to stay in during our stay in Colorado. We will definitely be back next year!]
