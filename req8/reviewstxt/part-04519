[101204283335004406552,100399898937230687049,It's good place to enjoy & hang out with friends. Though the mall is under maintenance but still you got few good options as Mcdonalds where you can have a movie with snacks makes a complete party pack. Screen's good, Sound not that great but good value for the money spent.]
