[106369859372482558304,100767159784273280451,John Boccaccio was wonderful to work with! He was able to find the exact car I wanted, and was even willing to trade an out of state dealer to get the specific car if need be. This was my first new car purchase and he made the process hassle-free and, walked me through each and every step. John was not pushy and you could tell he genuinely cares about getting customers a car they want, rather than just making a sale. When it's time for another new car, John has my business! Thanks Capital Eurocars for a great experience!]
