[105639648613428667926,100178832043174786284,Had not been into an Elmers in years. Stopped in on a crowded Sunday morning and the line moved quickly (big positive.) My waitress was very good - helpful without being my new best friend. I had a ham, cheese, mushroom omlettle and it was great. My son the berry crepe which was outstanding. Price was fine and the coffee kept getting refilled regularly. Great place.]
