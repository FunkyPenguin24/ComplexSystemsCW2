[113004314514233271952,101029257743285215321,I began seeing Dr. Mike and his team two weeks ago, and after just four visits, I am very pleased with the results so far. Their attention is fantastic as you don't feel like you're on a patient conveyor belt! Concerns are easily addressed and the focus is on you feeling your best. My only regret is that I didn't seek a local chiropractor sooner.]
