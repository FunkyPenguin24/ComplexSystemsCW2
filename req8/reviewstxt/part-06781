[105783205671372596179,100520793639780471890,The food was more disappointing than not! We started with a great appetizer boat, and looked forward to the other choices. It would seem that miso soup and white chocolate bread pudding could not fail, but they did, miserably. The "hot and sour Thai miso soup was just plain sour. The bread pudding had no taste at all -- just medium dry little cubes with no sauce. Luckily the good vanilla ice cream on the plate kept it from being a complete disaster. Of course the restaurant is warm and beautiful and the service was mostly excellent, with just a lapse toward the end when we were ignored after having been served the dessert. We probably would have been very happy had we made more good choices. The appetizer led us to expect great things of the kitchen, and I'm sure there were such things on the menu. One of our part got a salad that she pronounced "very good." But it's too bad when such simple things as miso soup, Thai soup (both usually wonderful wherever you find them) can be ruined by combining them, and bread pudding is a failure. It's very easy to make really great bread pudding! So, if you go, try to get menu recommendations ahead of time, or hope you make the right choices.]
