[104486296812569300937,100865620384871845434,my so called postal delivery person takes no pride in his work. He jammed my mailbox with my mail and now I cannot open it to get the mail out. I will have to wait until Monday to try to catch him while he is here to get my mail out. No one answers the phone at the post office when you call. I can't even go to the location to talk to the postmaster because he never comes out and his lackeys are no help at all, besides they closed at 12 noon on Saturdays so I am stuck until Monday if I can catch the delivery person when he is hereâ€¦fat chance.]
