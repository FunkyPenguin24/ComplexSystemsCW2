[110862135914992855204,100576648572333049717,One of the worst clinics I have ever been to. Went on a weekend and ended up waiting three hours to be seen. The medical assistant doing triage hardly allowed me to speak because she wanted to rush through the process. The doctor spent more time making fun of me and my life rather than examining me. After waiting for the three hours, the time the doctor spent with me was no more than five minutes before he threw a prescription at me and sent me out. Not once did he even ask me what my symptoms were or if anything else was bothering me. He just assumed based off of the medical assistant that didn't allow me to speak. I would rather go to the ER next time than to ever go here again. And to top it all off, the medicine he prescribed doesn't even work!]
