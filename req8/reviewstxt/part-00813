[112998000882690156721,100200982917941390446,I wanted to give the Wedding Shoppe a HUGE shout out. I wanted to thank them all for doing such a great job for my wedding party and I. I especially wanted to thank my consultant, Megan Kelly, for helping me find my dream dress! I explained what I liked to her and she went to work grabbing several styles that I liked. I ended up finding my dress that day! She even helped put my whole look together with accessories for my ceremony and reception looks!! We loved our experience so much we ended getting our bridesmaids dresses and tuxes there as well. Both the bridesmaids and tuxedo departments helped us put the whole look together. We received endless compliments on how our wedding party looked. Thanks Wedding Shoppe for making our day perfect!]
