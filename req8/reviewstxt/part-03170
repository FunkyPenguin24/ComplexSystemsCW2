[102413055561812705763,100322759827666720767,San Diego Mobility Vans came to our rescue when we wanted to provide our son a trip to Comicon last July. Jim accommodated us even though he already had a very full rental schedule. From our first conversation to us dropping off the van at the San Diego airport after an exciting adventure, Jim was professional and caring. We certainly look forward to calling on San Diego Mobility Vans when we are next in the area!]
