[108512363769901362017,100204469875187724176,A fantastic coffee shop to study, read and sip coffee. Early evening hours may be crowded, but once it settles down it's incredibly chill. I don't even like coffee, but the Summermoon Latte is my one exception. I've come here for 3+ years and every experience is a great one.]
