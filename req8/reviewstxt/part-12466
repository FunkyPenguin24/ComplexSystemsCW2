[100644451878625293566,100826749676165902244,I bought a Numark NS6 on Labor Day. I paid with cash and was quite happy with my purchase when I left. After tinkering with the controller for about 5 days or so, the effects knobs stopped working due to some sort of defect. I had my wife take the controller back with receipt for an exchange for the same controller. When she came home, she returned with another NS6 but in an open box and with the power supply missing. I do not blame my wife since she doesn't really have any knowledge of the equipment. She said an employee did all of the work for her and seemed knowledgeable. So it seems to me that he did this intentionally. I don't know when it became acceptable to exchange one defected item for another open box item with parts missing. Unacceptable. We live an hour and a half away, so this will be our 3rd time driving up there to get a working piece of equipment. I'm tempted to just take my money back and walk away. I will only shop here again if I have to.]
