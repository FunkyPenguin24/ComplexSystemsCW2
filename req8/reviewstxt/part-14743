[109836641552180655608,100952843973910226183,The beef is not halal. I called on 7/14/2013 to verify and was told it isn't halal. I noticed a previous review mentioning that they had halal beef so I called to verify. I haven't been to this place yet but I think I will soon. I certainly love NY pizza and if their's comes close, I'll probably turn into a regular customer. I'm leaving it at 3 stars until I get there.]
