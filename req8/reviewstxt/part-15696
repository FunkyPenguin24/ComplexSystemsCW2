[106273413980192525205,101004399631253912620,My boyfriend and I went here for dinner and we are not going back again. The waitress was unfriendly, she did not provide good service (she put my glass on top of the drink menu), the hushpuppies were fifteen mins late, and she did not come by one time to fill our glasses. The food was not worth the price. We spent over $60 for low-quality fried flounder and eight grilled scallops. We basically paid for the view of the marina. I left unsatisfied and upset about our experience.]
