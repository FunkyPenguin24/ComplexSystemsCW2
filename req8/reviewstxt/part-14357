[118344376883224043433,100932582701234223928,I use to be a loyal customer of there's but there quality has dropped in the last 6 months .The last straw was when I ordered at 7:56 and the food didn't arrive till 930.. they wrote down the wrong address and called at 8:50 to confirm the correct address and said it would be leaving out the door in 2 min.. it took them 40 min to drive 6 blocks!! I called the owner Jay the following day and he insults me and takes there side and has no customer support.. His drivers said they called 5 times and I wanted to take my phone down to him to show him I got one call... NEVER AGAIN !!! dont waste your time!!]
