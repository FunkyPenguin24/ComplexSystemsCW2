[101598232598330984708,100757385883660627718,Food here is at sub-par. The Pho here is terrible, I know if it wasn't the only place that served this stuff around here, then this place would prolly be unsuccessful. The service here was, completely horrible. OB is known as a stoner community, and well this place shows that this is still a very real description of the area. I DO, however recommend their happy hour, they serve dollar beers here, not always the best beer, but for a dollar you can't complain too much. The only reason to come here is they have decent beer for a dollar at happy hour, but eat before you come...]
