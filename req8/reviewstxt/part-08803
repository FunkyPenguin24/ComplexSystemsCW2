[106497725954399880200,100627772446298289643,I love the Bead Station!! I read the review others have left and I totally disagree with them. The service is amazing and the staff are so friendly. I was invited my first few times shopping at Bead station to an event where a group of woman get together and string beads. The owner brought tons of food and provided the event for free!! It was a blast. Through the love that is shown at the Bead Station, this great store is one of my first go to's for beads and supplies. Sometimes people just have a bad day and blame others and then they write a blog that can harm businesses, this is not ok.]
