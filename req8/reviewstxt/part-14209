[102619947468408402600,100923326589324866562,I've been a customer of Efax for about 10 years. I recently learned they have been ripping me off for years. Last month I was charged an additional $10 so when I "inquired" to American Express about a $10 charge Efax canceled my service. Apparently when they get an INQUIRY they just cancel your service. I called right away and I was told I can re-activate it, and guess what for a better rate! a better rate of $169/yr (meanwhile, were charging me $220 for YEARS!) Then a few days later I was charged $220 AGAIN. I called once again (and had to hold for 25 minutes before I got to speak to someone AGAIN) and was told they would credit my EFAX account (not my credit card) $36. What am I going to do with a STORE CREDIT at EFAX? I would never ever exceed the 200 page limits -- I rarely use the fax. I then asked to speak to a supervisor because the customer service agent was not authorized to do anything else. The "supervisor" spoke to me in a condescending tone the entire time and pretty much told me "too bad" and thats all he's going to do for me according to the contract. Let me just say, as a business owner, that this is a disgusting way of doing business. If my account wasn't accidentally canceled I would have never known that I was being charged MUCH MORE than the rest of the world for a better service package. I find this to be almost criminal! I am disgusted and appalled that a company the size of EFAX treats its customers this way. I will be spending the rest of my day warning others not to get in bed with these people and then contacting my lawyer to get all of my money back.]
