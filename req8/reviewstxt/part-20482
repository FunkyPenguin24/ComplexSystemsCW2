[105956454619002300377,100084981853346355036,Armstrong is a beautiful little oasis in the mid-town area of Long Beach. I love going there just to walk around and look at all the beautiful flowers and pots they have on display. The fountains and organization of plants are wonderful. Plants and supplies are a little on the pricier side - but I do feel their staff are professionals and extremely helpful, when it's not too busy.]
