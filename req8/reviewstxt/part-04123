[102655398134549458116,100377027685875774078,In July of last year, I purchased a used Chevy Tahoe from Crest Cadillac. This was the first time I had ever bought a vehicle from a dealer. It was a wonderful experience. I didn't really know what I was looking for at first. Just something bigger for my growing family. Michelle Corley was the salesperson we worked with. She sent me a list of what they had available in my price range and made suggestions based on my specific needs. The Tahoe she found even had an entertainment package for the kiddos too! :-) Needless to say, I would highly recommend Crest Cadillac to anyone looking to buy a car, whether new or used. It was a no-pressure environment that made it very easy to window shop without being harassed until we were ready to make a move. They gave me absolutely no reason to buy from anywhere else. THANK YOU CREST!]
