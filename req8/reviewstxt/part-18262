[115241296178674645848,101143703792650493244,Teocali is literally the only Mexican restaurant in town that I would recommend to someone who actually likes Mexican food. I grew up in the southwest eating LOTS of Mexican, and it took me a really long time to find somewhere in Kansas City that meets my exacting standards! Needless to say, this is that place! Pros: The food is outstanding... their enchiladas are as good as my mom and grandma's! The decor is fine... nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be. The owner is really nice and is very attentive to customers. He also seems to be around a lot which I think is helpful for running a restaurant smoothly. Cons: It tends to get really crowded, especially at lunchtime, so you will need to plan for that, or just be patient and not go when you're in a hurry. The waitresses in my experience are sometimes not great. Overall, though, I'd give Teocali 4 out of 5 stars... with 5+++++ stars for the cuisine!]
