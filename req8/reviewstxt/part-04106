[118070578062702767753,100375534827848836830,Service - 5/10. Difficult to find servers with a smile. Food - 6/10. Whoever has heard of Kaathi roll being served cold !!! They have butchered one of the most authentic eatery item.. Egg Biryani was ok though. Price - $$$ Definitely not in my re-visiting list.]
