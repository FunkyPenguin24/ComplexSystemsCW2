[102058259951893901760,100842607142395561442,Thanks for nothing Alan K. Its always nice to see the Used Car man living up to his slimy reputation. Nice on the phone.....very polite and grateful for the call. Then once i send a kid to look at the car.....the buzzards swarm in. Thanks for trying taking advantage of the situation. Its called honesty and integrity Alan K, and you have none. You should be ashamed of you self.]
