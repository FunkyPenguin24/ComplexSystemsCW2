[107817520643884211159,100210321052330105163,Not your typical car sales man! When I walked in and was met by Nate Cosman I was shocked. He was clean cut, handsome, low pressure, and very sharp! He really was wanting to find out what I was looking for and at the payment I could afford. I had been to so many other dealers when they guy did not know what he was doing or he just looked like he rolled out of bed with his dress clothes on, but Nate I would definately reccomend and on top of it all if you send him a customer that purchases a vehicle you get $200!]
