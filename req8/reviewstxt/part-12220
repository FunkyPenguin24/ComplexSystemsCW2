[116048138757793733170,100812899070862747729,Being a second time client the biggest problem I experienced is the delivery of my purchase. When it comes to delivering outside the CBD I have to wait longer than 72hrs to get my purchase. The first purchase was a ADSL router that held up my business for days before it was eventually delivered after calling the courier over and over. The second purchase was the delivery of a battery that took ages to get to me. The order was placed on the 23rd of December, processed on the 28th and the package was finally delivered on the 7th of January 2013. My suggestion: Change courier companies or if you cannot do door to door for us in the township then have a place in the CBD where we can go to collect our goods cause everyday we spend waiting is a day wasted (especially for goods that our businesses are dependent upon).]
