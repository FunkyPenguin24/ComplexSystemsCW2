[106194902134204872789,100828215760295003272,You know, I see some of the negative reviews here, but I have been in twice and never had anything but great service. Now, Dave is the store manager and both times he helped me......So maybe that makes a difference. The cars were clean, not smoked in and I thought the rate was fair. It wasn't dirt cheap, but it was fair for what I was getting......Which was a car with 4,000 miles on it.]
