[110661373710018530197,100493636999676229658,My experiences at this particular Genghis Grill has always been during a lighter part of the day when there may have been only a handful of customers. Xochil, the hostess\wait staffer, was nice. When I asked about off-menu drinks, she described something that she likes to make for herself and offered me to try. What sets apart G.G. as a whole is the bowl creations. I can literally make whatever dish suits my palate. Spicy, tangy, subtle, bold, rich, etc. They have everything to keep it new ... and to keep it just the way you like it.]
