[105306810805033954994,100004127992274577196,A neighbor of mine thought that the Independent Cleaning Service they were using was trustworthy, .... until the neighbor across from them met them as they pulled into their driveway. It turns out that they witnessed the "Cleaning Person" leaving the house TWICE with bulging gym bags (bags that were empty when the cleaning person entered the house!). They tried to detain the person and told them that the police were on the way, but no -- they had to leave! Well, as you might suspect, my neighbor's house was robbed. . . Heirlooms, Jewelry, collectibles, old coins, tools - anything of value! So sad! My point is, my neighbor declined my recommendation to use Molly Maid of Leon County. I told them that the Molly Maid employees were held to the highest standard of honesty & professionalism. My neighbor thought that they were "saving" money going the "cheap way." Don't follow my neighbor's example. Call Molly Maid of Leon County!]
