[117526393200504694534,100673907920336187234,Finally took the time to drive from Prosper to the GMB&G! What a complete let down. If you look at the video tapes around 9-10pm, you will see us walking around looking for signs of how to get a drink and some dinner, do we sit ourselves do we go to bar are there servers? LMAO after being obvious we were not going to get any help from ANY>>>>> of the staff we used the rest room, then sat at the rail asked the hostess for 411 but after waiting around for service we threw in the towel! Not one hello, or contact from valet to hostess to bartender who did make eye contact several times to the passing by employees. They all seemed too busy serving only people they knew and gave the vibe that if we didnt know them personally we were out of luck. We got the hint! SO WE LEFT, $100 bucks richer and still hungry for dinner and drinks. Ironically the only person that did talk to us was a first time visitor like us, only he was so wasted he could barely talk. Said to us woohoo I have the GM shirt at home. LMAO. Was it a Tuesday, sure! But if your open for business the service should be good any time you are open for business. Conclusion: wasted trip! Pros: Really cool water surrounds the place Cons: everything else Would I return: NO Would I recommend to others: NO My wife is a server and has been in the restaurant industry for over 10 years and I have managed several restaurants in DFW! Never would this lack of service fly even on our Monday nights! Best of luck with the GMB&G! If you ever ask why this place is not making the money it could, read reviews like this. Stay cool! No harm done. We found other place for drinks and dinner. JMA@GENA]
