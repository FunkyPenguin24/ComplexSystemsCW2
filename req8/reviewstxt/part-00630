[118382258962397585168,100192417854671152833,I purchased a 2007 PT Cruiser from Bob Royston this week. He was a pleasure to deal with, knowledgeable and unfailingly polite throughout the process. He and Shawn and the service department went above and beyond to get a repair I requested made in one day, so I could purchase the car and drive it back to Kentucky, and not make another trip up there. I got a great deal on the car, a great price on my trade-in, and unbeatable service. I'd recommend them to anyone.]
