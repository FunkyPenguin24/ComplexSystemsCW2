[103764906149285441655,100267770754986022177,I booked this hotel for two nights especially for a vacation with my mom who came from Europe. After the long drive we were looking forward to checking in to the luxury hotel room. The receptionists were really nice, but this is the only positive I could relate to. To our disappointment, the facility was really really old, with tape all over the floor and the elevator. Right next to the door to our room, there was plenty of water on the floor (that's how it stayed for 2 days! - nobody came to wipe it off). Inside, the room was looking pretty old, and the sound of AC was extremely loud. But even more annoying was the fact that the counter top in the bathroom, as well the table inside the room was covered with sand. Also there was some hair in the floor of the bathroom. The water in the tub was not going through well. A couple of more "surprises": the cellular reception was very poor and was constantly disconnecting, and the coffee maker in the room was filled with.............milk. Imagine how "thoroughly" they clean their rooms. Another annoying fact is that this old dirty hotel charges extra for literally everything: parking, breakfast, internet for guests. Internet was also so bad, that I had to wait with posting this review until I actually got home. It simply disconnected me from the web every few seconds. And that's for $10 a day. I would never come to this hotel again, and would recommend others to stay away from it. Also, if you happen to be an HHonors, they will try to waste your time and invite you to buy into their Time Share. Guess what? There is no way I would even consider that after such an awful experience!]
