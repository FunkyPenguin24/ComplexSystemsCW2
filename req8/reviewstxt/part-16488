[115615036503707491250,101046364060789929230,This place is known for its responsibly-sourced ingredients and friendly baristas. They really do care about their customers. The last time I went here, the business was slow, so the baristas were actually practicing their lattes! Talk about dedication to an art! I've heard they plan to roast their own coffee soon, as well as open their own full kitchen. If it's as good as the coffee, I will definitely be dining :)]
