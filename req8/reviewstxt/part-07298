[101859015185649537357,100548956050944847049,Fleming Meadows is my favorite place to camp when visiting Lake Don Pedro. Many of my summers were spent there as a child and they have done an amazing job of keeping the place beautiful. The camping facilities are well groomed and spaced out fairly well. The general store and marina although somewhat expensive are well stocked with most anything you might need, including ice when you inevitably run out! The boat launch is well maintained and they keep it running smoothly. The swimming lagoon (oversized mud puddle) is a great place to go cool off when you aren't out in the boat. The Lake is enormous and gorgeous. There are so many little coves to explore. But, I especially like (after a day of fun in the sun) to wander around in the evenings a bit to listen to the crickets and watch the bats and owls fly around. Mystical. There are several great places to camp, I won't tell you my favorite though because I want to keep it for myself! You will just have to go there and find your own little piece of California gold.]
