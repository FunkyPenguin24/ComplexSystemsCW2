[100724815842205984784,100972811051693162839,Chipotle is mexican food gone subway! You can pick whatever you like in a line and put whatever things you like in your burrito! Even though the guacamole is another 2 dollars I get it! I believe it is worth it! Their tabasco green sauce is amazing! my favorite thing to get ever!!!!]
