[100366115892915456770,100254846651220492509,They did a fantastic job. I need wall repair and paint, kitchen faucet replacement, and grout work. Everything was done well and they cleaned up after. They even proactively painted some other nicks on the wall that I did not specify. In addition, when the faucet did not work properly, they went out and got a replacement and installed it. I was very satisfied with their work.]
