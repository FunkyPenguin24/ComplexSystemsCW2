[100168456213833904756,100404882167360209822,Found this place last minute and was able to book a room online. They accept Google Wallet so booking online was very easy. The Hotel Owner was very nice and patient with me when I decided to change my reservation from one two nights to one. The owner also furnished an iron and board on request. The location is great because it's in downtown Eureka. As far as the exterior goes it looks cheap and the inside of the room is small. The neighborhood seems to be a bit rough around the edges and I saw a few people sleeping in the street. Other than that it's a good spot to crash after a 10 1/2 hour drive.]
