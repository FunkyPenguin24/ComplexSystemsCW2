[109318641429286510556,100047679106364060080,This is one of our absolute favorite restaurants, we go about once/week. The food is affordable and delicious. I get an extra order of injera with my meal and always have enough left over for lunch the next day. The spicing of the food is way better than the other Ethiopian restaurant in town, and the service is friendly.]
