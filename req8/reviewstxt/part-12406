[111555940484003438568,100823612234234460286,Used to go here in 2012 when prices were cheap and portions were large, to be fair I still come here in 2013 despite prices going up and portions getting smaller purely because it's convenient with the kids. The play area is welcome distraction while we wait for our food to arrive (which could sometimes be up to an hour) and the food is obviously not made fresh on the premises (correct me if i'm wrong) but is acceptable. If you're looking for a clean establishment to take the kids to eat with semi healthy food options then this place is worth considering.]
