[112020667317750282340,100161811919322854352,Just bought a great car yesterday. Robert (Bob) Ott was WONDERFUL. He took the time to explain everything to us and was very patient. After working with him and moving through the entire process, everybody we talked to were friendly and helpful. This was our first experience buying a car through Spitzer and we would recommend them to anybody. Thanks Bob!]
