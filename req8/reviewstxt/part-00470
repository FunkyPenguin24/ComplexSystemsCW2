[111258782406510596618,100183355359537004936,I had excellent service, respect and care for my Great Dane, Whitney. Whitney was close to the end of her wonderful life and this clinic was wonderful to her. I went for acupuncture to help ease Whitney's pain and it was helping her alot. Also, when it came time for Whitney to ease away to the Rainbow Bridge, our vet from this clinic came to our house on her day off, to help Whitney go in peace. Can not say enough wonderful things about this clinic and people!]
