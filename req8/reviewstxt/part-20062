[102142073565719263772,100063624789091057142,I really love this place. It is a little more expensive than other places i have eaten at... but the food is soooooo good.. Highly recommend the Kikoman, Phoenix, Copper River, and Geisha rolls. I have eaten sushi all over the country as I travel A LOT. This is one of my favorite spots.]
