[115330642335993063204,100533171538227229304,OK, this isn't the most up-to-date review, but I can confirm that the TVs aren't a new addition. I was watching the rugby autumn internationals there in 1997, when I was living over the road. Admittedly they were only on for the rugby and final score on a saturday. Back then it was an awesome pub, with a proper welcome. They were most sympathetic to me when I came back to town after 3 weeks away at Christmas, and couldn't remember the number to get into my apartment block. They even lent me a couple of pints while I tried to remember it, sitting with my suitcase. Happy days :-)]
