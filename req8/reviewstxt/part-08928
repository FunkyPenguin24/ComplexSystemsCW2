[103072150845319889948,100634772241713341275,This store has been the worst experience i have ever had with rent to own business's. They wanted us to pay half a payment to order the items early. it is now almost 2 months later and we are still waiting are part of the items we wanted. If i where you i would look else where for a rent to own.]
