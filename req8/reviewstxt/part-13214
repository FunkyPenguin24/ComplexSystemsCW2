[112416282144330882558,100868738840147967066,Alta had a great selection of tapas. I ended up splitting plates of fried goat cheese in honey, brussel sprouts (surpringly delicious), and the lamb meat balls which had an egg yolk to dip in. We also split a plate of paella, which although was very tasty was different than any other I've had before, and didn't seem so authentic. It had like cous cous type grains in it and noodles, which seemed strange. I also had the chocolate molten cake, which was AMAZING. Just oozed with warm chocolate, which was complemented by a scoop of cold ice cream. Service was very quick and attentive. The sangria was also very flavorful, and you could definitely feel it. The ambiance of the place was very romantic with its dim lights and candles. The one suggestion I would have is to put a sign outside the place! I walked past it twice before I realized where it was.]
