[102408963378438079989,100069948441376483441,Great little book store and coffee shop. The service can be a little on the slow side, but there's often only one person behind the counter. It's hard to warrant having a big, speedy staff in such a small town so I can't blame them for not being the fastest shop ever. BTW, the coffee and live music is terrific!]
