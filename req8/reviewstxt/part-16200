[117756569963342876845,101031720799924661099,In the matter of a half hour while waiting for a cab, I called the dispatch on a timeframe update at 15, 25, and 30 minutes, each time the dispatch said they were pulling up any moment. Here j am still waiting on the cab, 32 minutes later. Get a different cab, these guys suck. I'm hungover, my car is in on South Howard, and I want Chipotle.]
