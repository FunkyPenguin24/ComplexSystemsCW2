[114501445973881621342,100588138784026680765,Wife's review: Yesterday had my dog groomed. I called ahead of time to notify the groomers that my husband would be picking up my dog, and they said she would be about 15 more minutes. Perfect! So when he got there about 20 minutes later, she wasn't finished and another dog was being groomed, not her. So he waited about another 30. Fine. But this whole time the staff was arguing with each other in front of him. He said not to take her there again because they were rude. I wouldnt have minded if the service was still good. But today less than 24 hours later, she is still leaking all of her anal fluids. Anal gland expression is part of the "Dog Bath" and it was clearly not done. This was the cherry on top of a bad experience. Won't be back... sorry to say.]
