[115668937965828135258,100650525267519876033,My wife and I bought two Dealfind vouchers for this restaurant, and had a terrible experience at the establishment when we tried to treat some very important colleagues out to dinner. We were seated for more than half an hour before the servers finally took our order. After we placed our order, we had to wait for more than a whole hour before the food had finally arrived. And when the food had finally gotten there, they had gotten our orders wrong, so we had to wait another half hour before we could properly start our meal. The servers were also very rude. We had to flag a waitress down to finally be served, and she behaved very passive aggressively towards us. And when we sent our orders back to be corrected, they reacted very defensively. It was very unprofessional of them. My wife and I have not returned to this restaurant ever since, and we did not even consider gifting the second voucher to a friend because we would never recommend it to anybody. We have since received a full refund for both vouchers from Dealfind.]
