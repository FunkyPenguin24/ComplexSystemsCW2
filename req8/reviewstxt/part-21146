[102144935751345719186,100120437671266329368,We just purchased our 2013 Chevrolet Silverado from Rudy Rangel at James Wood. Rudy was so helpful and courteous from the very start. He showed us trucks in each price bracket we might want to look in and didn't try to sway us one way or another. He was patient while we tried to decide which one might be best for us. We relocated from Missouri to Texas last year and this was our first car buying experience in the state of TX and we are so glad we chose James Wood!!!! This was by far the best experience we have EVER had purchasing a new vehicle. It was easy and went smoothly from the very beginning. We will definitely be back to see Rudy should we need a vehicle in the future!]
