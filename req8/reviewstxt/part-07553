[106607355101151657088,100563516430230154711,Confused finding it since Ramada signs were up, too. First room was filthy, hairs, smells, horrible stains on carpets and linens (incl pillowcases, etc.). We asked for another room and it was a little better, but not great. We only stayed because we had arrived very late and it was near where we needed to be. By far the worst condition hotel on our 2900 mile trip. They should have paid us to stay there. It was $130 for 2 nights. Ripoff.]
