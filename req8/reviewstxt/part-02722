While it's only a stumble away from Kings Cross (literally across from the Coke sign), it's another one of Sydney's hole in the wall spots that serves a strong cocktail, dishes up a sweet ambience, and serves as a great point to kick on from, whether you're heading towards Shady Pines way or back towards the Coke sign - depending on how many cocktails you've had!]
