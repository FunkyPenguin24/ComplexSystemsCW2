[116218520950032650621,100419411469387917058,My experience with AIM all centers around Dr. Dennis Furr, and he is truly a find! He is the best doctor I've ever known. He treats all of his patients with great respect, and is one of the few doctors I know who still believes understanding what a patient is thinking and feeling is crucial to understanding a patient's total wellness. He follows up to see how we are doing after ever visit, no matter how trivial the issue. He has been our family doctor for almost 25 years now, and I can't imagine taking my loved ones anywhere else!]
