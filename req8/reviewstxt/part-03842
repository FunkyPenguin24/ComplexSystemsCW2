[102503541600505125247,100360546518857835207,I have been using California Midwifery Services since 2007. I have had 3 of my 4 children with Rosanna Davis and plan on using them again for #5 this fall!! Rosanna and staff are always very professional, yet care about you in a very personal way. We decided to have our first homebirth because we felt is was the safest way to have a VBAC with the highest chance of success. After our first the others were 'no-brainers', the level of care far exceeded my (first) hospital birth (a c-section). I have nothing but great things to say about Rosanna Davis and California Midwifery Services. Angela - Sunnyvale, CA]
