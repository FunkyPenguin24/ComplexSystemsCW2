[108381990794371137423,100281468253138898067,A rare gem in a world populated by now generic and medium quality brand S. The only place that I have found in south OC that makes a brew on par with Peets. Run by Tim and Debbie Higgins, just opened recently. Tim is a passionate and meticulous expert Barista. Not just a guy that thought a coffee shop was a good idea for a business. Nice selection of high quality pastries, sandwiches, juices and breakfast goodies. You won't see cheap donuts or sugar bombs there. A few nice touches: There is a secure play area for tots by the main window, stocked with a small mountain of toys. Perfect place for mom's to chillax in the afternoon. Knife for my bagel with cream cheese was made from recycled wood. Not a single container or utensil was non-recyclable. On right side of road for southbound morning traffic. Tons of easy access parking]
