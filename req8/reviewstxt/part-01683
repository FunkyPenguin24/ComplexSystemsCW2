[101806892580295468568,100246834339464063088,I am a 17 year professional tattoo artist. I had never visited a chiropractor in the past, due to worrying about the cost. About 3 months ago I started feeling more soreness than usual in my back and shoulder. My husband who is a roofer, suggested that I go see his chiropractor. To my surprise, Dr. Groff was able to diagnose the issue without even an x-ray and I am feeling so much better with the therapy and advise. The staff are all very knowledgable and sweet.You are very much the top priority in this office. I am now a loyal patient.]
