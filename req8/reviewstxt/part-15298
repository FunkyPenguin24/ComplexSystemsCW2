[101148095580681492630,100982383395959271895,Dr Walsh and Dr Maxwell have saved our dog not once but twice!! This is an amazing group of specialized veterinarians and nurses. So grateful to have a specialist and er clinic in one building. For those who have complained about money and expense, you get what you pay for and thats quality care. Also,they are excellent for giving estimates and staying within the estimate range, giving updates daily. Thank you PetMed and MVS for the love, care, and compassion you have given our four legged children. We thank you for all you care and support]
