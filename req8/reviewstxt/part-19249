[114299304709538439557,100019352782414587671,I love this outwardly unassuming but truly beautiful studio, and only wish it were located closer to home and/or work! I've had fantastic experiences with every visit, especially the hour-long hot class on Sundays, which always serves to reset and recharge me for the week ahead. :) I'm grateful for Yoga Harmony's professional yet personable instructors and lovely facility, enriching my practice and therefore my life!]
