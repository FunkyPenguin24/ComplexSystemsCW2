[109562373645489670307,100312544497367351145,Chino is still as funky, fantastic and fabulous as it always was. The music is a perfect mix of funky house grooves. The room feels intimate and still looks perfect for a dinner date in red and black. And the food is as fresh, tasty and creative as before. The chicken tempura in a mango chilli sauce I just had is testament to that. When the Arena is in full swing, this place will be packed. Just make sure you don't miss out.]
