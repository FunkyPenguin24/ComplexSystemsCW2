[103871859755115555605,100884017636925774437,I was driving through Washington and had a coolant leak on my GTI. I needed a water pump replaced and it was a long weekend. They told me it would be Monday. Got me a loaner vehicle. Then, 5 hours later, they called me with the great news that they got it done. They got me back on the road the same day (Friday). The service was amazing. This is a great new dealership with great service. I haven't been to a more competent VW dealership.]
