[105669109770726831523,100799608896285750755,DON'T SUPPORT THIS SHOP! This place is awful! I've given it so many chances. The last straw was when I was looking through a bin of bicycle bells, and the owner, Loretta came to visit. I do't think she saw me as I was bent down- she stormed in, being increasingly rude to the sweet sales girl. I could not believe it. I then moved to a different art of the store- hoping she'd stop and be embarrassed to be screaming in front of a customer- Wrong-o! She continued to be-little the girl to the point where I thought there'd be tears. I later learned that some of my friends have witnessed similar scenarios at Area Kids shops. It's a wonder the store is in business considering how ugly the owner is to her employees. I used to bear the lack of new inventory to find some cute eco-friendly toys, but not anymore. My friends and I will be bringing our business elsewhere.]
