[116357455183936230241,100654750652514234176,Was in Paris late July this year. A friend of mine just visited the city and gave me a list of restaurants she went. I booked Josephine for lunch not knowing much about it. Once I got there and saw a valet outside I knew this place would be interesting. The moment I sat down I was given a glass of white (free of charge). I'm guessing that this is a traditional thing. The menu comes and its all in French (turns out there's an English menu), so I simply asked what's good. The waiter pointed to the Veal, "It's very good" he said. I ordered it even though it was 43 euros. I also ordered a half order of house pate. Long story short, the pate was fabulous. Then comes the veal....it was absolutely the best piece of meat I've had in my 30 years of existence, even the mash potatoes that came with it was superb. I savoured every bite and was extremely glad I didn't cheap out on not ordering it. The only pity was that I saw an absolutely delicious looking Napolean being served at other tables, and I didn't get it because it was a 30minute wait (it said on the menu but I had the French one). So make sure you get that too because I basically saw everyone else get it. Bottom line, if you like classic French food, go there. This place made the other places I went in Paris pedestrian (I went to modern French places after that). Really try it out!]
