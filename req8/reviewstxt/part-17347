[108139732557363697512,101094501252366796292,Worst auto service I have ever received. I purchased 2011 Toyota Camry a few months previous from private seller. I went in to Toyota of San Diego for an alignment (car pulling to right), everything checked out "good." I do not drive the car much, only use as long commuter. Next weekend I drove the car to Arizona the car still pulls to the right. I bring the car back the next week, after waiting 20 minutes to get checked in with making an appointment, they check and claim car is out of alignment and caster/camber is bent. This was not indicated on my last alignment 2 weeks ago and they said I must have damaged the car in the two weeks. I barely drove the car! They wanted to charge me another $89 for an alignment? What? Spoke with assistant manager, they left me waiting 15 minutes to look up old records, and she put me back with the staff member. Who told me the same thing, assuming I damaged the car. Do not go to this dealer, they should not be part of Toyota.]
