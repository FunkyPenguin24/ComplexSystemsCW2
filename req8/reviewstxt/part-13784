[109309804174522841886,100900148407655923987,Blue Island is excellent - we gather our friends and family together for most birthdays and celebrations there, including the night before we got married, and my upcoming 40th. The decor is basic, and facilities rustic but acceptable - I'd been walking past it for years before even considering going in, because it is on a main route between bigger and brasher places, and looks so simple - but we have never been disappointed by the food or service, which is always excellent. The owner in particular makes you feel very welcome, and knew our names by the second visit. We recommend the meze - it's reasonably priced, and each dish that gets brought to you is of a really high standard... there's a chicken dish that usually comes out near the end that is OH MY GOD so tender and tasty that it's making me feel hungry just writing about it. WARNING: Try not to fill up on pitta bread and dips before the food comes out. It's a schoolboy error, and one that we make every time. Most restaurants do that on purpose, but you really do get a lot of food for your money here, and you won't want to leave any. We always get any leftovers wrapped up and take them home.]
