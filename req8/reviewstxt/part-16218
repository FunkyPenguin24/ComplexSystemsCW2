[103592688304868828694,101032804426969099430,Seriously can't describe how good I feel! It's been about 2 weeks since Dr. Reimann figured out exactly what I needed and the results are amazing! Increased energy, joint pain diminishing, sleeping great, clearer thinking.....and it's not like I was eating junk food before visiting the Dr. She simply found out the things I was low on and added them into my diet. Saves a lot of guess work - and eliminated some supplements I didn't need. If anyone wants a really good Dr. (ND or MD....she beats every MD I've ever been to!) & wants to feel good again, Call Dr. Reimann. When I find someone good at what they do, I like to share! Have been referring all my friends to her & am taking my grown children to her as well! Update: it's been about 6 weeks now & still feeling fantastic - continuing to feel better & better as more time goes by.]
