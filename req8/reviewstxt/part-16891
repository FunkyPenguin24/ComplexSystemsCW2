[117989850023280713523,101068408866162090070,I go here with a group almost every week and wish I didn't, but the group choose the venue. As a group we must drop anywhere from $300-$500 a week in this place! We have seen good waitress come and go because of the management. The space we meet in has these overhead lights that don't work, we have asked the manager to fix so we can see what we are doing while we meet. You'd think after spending thousands of dollars in this place he could afford to replace the light bulbs, but he didn't. Some people have resorted to bringing in flash lights, literally, I wish I was being dramatic, so we can see while we eat and meet. The other thing is that they don't like to turn on the A/C, we often leave early in the summers because we are so warm its uncomfortable. The food is hit or miss, sometimes really good, sometimes really poor. The only thing you can count on is that it will be different each time you get it. You can tell that somewhere in the mix is a good chef, but somewhere it breaks down. The specials are usually pretty good. Then entrees are way over priced. The decor is dumpy, the bathrooms gross and this is coming from someone that doesn't really care how it looks as long as it is good food.]
