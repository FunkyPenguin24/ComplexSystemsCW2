[107243474670491849807,100671042595783933005,I am French and live in Defence Colony, a 10 minute walk from the Nanda Dental Clinic. I wanted to find a dentist in the area to be able to return easily for regular treatment. Before visiting the clinic, I found this website and I liked the fact that the Nanda couple looked young, very friendly, and with good references. Their clinic also looked welcoming. Well, I must say that I was not disappointed. I got an appointment quickly. I had to undergo root canal but unlike what I had heard about the procedure it was really not a big deal! My dentist in Delhi is now Dr Smriti but her husband is most likely a good match:)- I learned today that they are about to celebrate their second anniversary...So Happy Anniversary, Happy Trip & See you soon!]
