[118309687659913090566,100931776089398030411,Very good place for work/office. Very quiet and subdued with ample parking space. Some premium food shops in the area - Starbucks and such. Could do with some low to mid level food shops for the budget conscious work bee. The function area is also good, I hear. Pricey though.]
