[111792039924194673188,100316697640179886045,I ordered the shrimp enchilada, and the server brought my a chicken enchilada... Few minutes after, I mentioned the mix-up to the server but told her that I was happy with the chicken and not to worry about... Then the manager came out and that is when my good experience turned horrible. He proceeded to say with a smart tone in his voice: "I see that you got the chicken instead of the shrimp. The chicken tastes better and it is cheaper. So you lucked out". I replied that I would not know since I did not have a chance to try the shrimp, and then he replied: "That's good. The chicken is better and you saved a few bucks. Good for you!" You can imagine my surprise at his attitude and comment! To top it off, when I left the valet guy was gone, and I had to circle around for 15 minutes to find somebody to give me my keys back......]
