[106190019214060338590,100273172524161636622,Awesome experience - was a crappy situation, turned out cool! I changed clothes at work, and was headed to the gym, when I realized I locked my keys in the trunk. I did a search for "locksmith" and "Local Locksmith" came up. Gave them a call, told them my location, and dude said he'd be there within 10 minutes. He arrived, handed me his business card, "Beau Norton", and proceeded with his tools. Had the door open in no time! Will definitely keep the business card and number on file for future reference. Highly recommended!]
