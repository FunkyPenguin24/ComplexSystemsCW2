[115470904534677507859,100554902498865099972,Dentist...or Spa? I love this place! I used to fear the dentist as a child but now I look forward to visiting the friendly staff at Horizon Dental. They always remember me and things I've told them in past visits, they never take too long on procedures or cleanings, and they are very accommodating to every issue a patient may have. Even better is that they encourage me to take care of my teeth and gums and give me praise when I have done so! All of my friends are openly jealous that my visit comes with a paraffin wax hand-dip and chair massage, which I also find to be a major perk of my experience at Horizon Dental. I've been a patient since 2008 and I'll continue to be as long as I'm a resident of the City of Trees!]
