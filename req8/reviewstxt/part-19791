[117930156204995305146,100049339289993377852,My friend recommended a day out on the North Fork as a great date with my new girlfriend (now my wife!). We weren't much into wineries (had to drive back to BK) so this place was perfect for a stop over between the beach and dinner on the water. We picked some lavender but were more into walking around the fields, taking pictures and chilling on the porch of the farm stand chatting with other visitors. I got stung by a bee and the farmer/owner was really helpful and actually gave me some lavender oil to put on the sting (who knew?). My car still smells like lavender,my girlfriend loves showing off her pictures from the lavender farm, and beyond my bee sting I'm still getting props for one of the best dates ever...]
