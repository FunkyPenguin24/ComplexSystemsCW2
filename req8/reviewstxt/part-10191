[108475058230566135349,100704567972053507753,Had a 3pm Saturday appointment booked for myself, wife and daughter. 3:40, we still hadn't been seen by anyone and no apologies. Finally my daughter is called in. The receptionist tells me that they don't work with our insurance company. My wife tells me that she told the person who booked the appointment who our carrier was. A total waste of time. Paying a monthly premium for vision care, I wasn't about to pay out of pocket for their exams. VERY poor customer service, very disappointing.]
