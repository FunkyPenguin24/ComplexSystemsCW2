[101360777229770297621,100047959829115052122,I made the reservation online. I used a credit card that had my married name on it. Upon check in, when the clerk looked at my drivers' license that had my maiden name, she didn't want to accept it, even though my first name was on both cards, and I showed her other cards with my maiden name on them. She kept saying it was for my "protection". Bull caca! My husband finally talked her into letting us check in. I had told her I am a member of the Marriott Rewards Club, but it didn't matter. No one in a hotel has ever been this rude. For pusishment, she put us in a room that looked like it had not been repaired since Hurricane Katrina! Horrible smells of mold and obvious water damage. We waited until the next day when that clerk was not on duty, and asked to be switched. After the inconvenience of having to repack and wait for the new room to be cleaned, as well as the ugly treatment from the front desk, I doubt if I will be staying at a Marriott again.]
