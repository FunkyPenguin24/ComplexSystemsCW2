[104121949363427181714,100028638221028523120,I manage my own refurbishment company who carry out work within the London area. I stumbled upon CleenCo by chance, I was working on a refurbishment project in Notting Hill and had a deadline for when my project had to be finished, spring cleaned ready for my clients for when they returned from holiday. I was let down by a cleaning company i regularly used, i searched for a local clean company when I found CleenCo and they worked hard to accommodate my deadline and worked round the clock with a professional clean, the house looked spotless when my clients returned and was more than happy. From that day I have always used CleenCo, i find them reliable, honest and hard working, they always carry out the job to a professional high standard and will go the extra mile to accommodate my needs and deadlines. I would highly recommend them and would like to thank them for the hard work they have put into my jobs so far. GD Plastering Services]
