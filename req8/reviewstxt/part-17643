Mike (the owner) is a great guy, and they have a great selection of board and card games, as well as a lot of table space to play on. If you don't see what you're looking for, just ask - they'll order most anything you want. Snacks, drinks, and coffee for cheap, as well as a lot of food options within walking distance.]
