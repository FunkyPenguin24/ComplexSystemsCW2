[108510393375406150957,100712144748395089116,This was by far my BEST car buying experience. The staff at Universal KIA are friendly, helpful, and courteous. Billy Bidwell has restored my confidence that good car salesmen do exist. It is because of him I was able to purchase a quality affordable car, and he worked out the best possible deal for me. He has a wonderful sense of humor and made me feel like family. Billy drove all the way from Franklin to Clarksville which is about an hour and fifteen minute drive to pick me up and bring me to the dealership. When I arrived I received great customer service and was able to drive home the same day in my new car :) Thank you Billy and Tabatha for making this process so easy for me, you guys rock! Four days later and I am still in awe, smiling from ear to ear. I feel great about my purchase and will gladly recommend Universal KIA to anyone looking to purchase a new or quality used vehicle and please see Billy Bidwell he is AWESOME!!!]
