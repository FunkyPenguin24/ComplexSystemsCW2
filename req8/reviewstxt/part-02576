[106134992180801000155,100291295441709351830,THE ABSOLUTE WORST COMPANY IN HISTORY---SOMEONE NEEDS TO SHUT THEM DOWN!!! I AM EXTREMELY INFURIATED BY THE LACK OF PROFESSIONALISM TO SAY THE ABSOLUTE LEAST, I HAVE NEVER LIKED THIS COMPANY BUT WAS FORCED TO HAVE THEM WITH MY LAST MOVE, AND EVENTUALLY COULD NOT TAKE IT ANYMORE, DUE TO THEM CHARGING ME LATE FEES EACH MONTH, AND SPENDING OVER 2 HRS ON THE PHONE EACH MONTH, BECAUSE THEY HAD 'NOT ACTIVATED MY AUTO PAY, ALTHOUGH, EACH MONTH I WAS ASSURED, IT WAS 'ACTIVATED AND NOT TO WORRY', THIS EFFECTED MY CREDIT, AND MY NERVES, AND COST ME TIME AWAY FROM FAMILY AND WORK---- NOW, I AM BEING TOLD 'I STILL OWE THEM $52???? FOR WHAT????? AS HAVE NOT HAD THEIR SERVICE IN OVER A YEAR, AND RETURNED ALL THEIR JUNKY EQUIPMENT IN 'THEIR PROVIDED BOXES' AND HAD A ZERO BALANCE, BUT NOW THAT I AM TRYING TO GET A LOAN, I CAN'T DUE TO A $52 OUTSTANDING FEE?????? AND, CUSTOMER SERVICE, BOTH LOCAL AND THEIR CORPORATE OFFICE….A COMPLETE JOKE! I HAVE LITERALLY PAGES OF NOTES OF THINGS SAID, THAT NO ONE WOULD EVER BELIEVE, OTHER THAN I HAD WITNESSES INCLUDING MY BIZ PARTNER, AS IT WAS SO UNBELIEVABLE. SOMEONE, SERIOUSLY NEEDS TO ………..S H U T THEM DOWN!!!!!]
