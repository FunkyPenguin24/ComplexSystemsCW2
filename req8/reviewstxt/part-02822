[100181950862640394198,100304409201889700668,Don't buy a timeshare from these guys! The sales people will tell you anything to get a sale then when you meet with the guy to do a new owner orientation all he does is tell you, you basically got screwed and he doesn't know what you were told by the sales person. Then spends the rest of the time showing you what you could do if you buy something else. Lot's of passing the buck, but the bottom line is they want you to pay $10k-15k to buy the timeshare, annual dues of $210 and then pay $150-$500 average if you want to plan a vacation more than a month in advance. They tell you that you can plan in advance in the presentation, but then in your orientation they tell you completely different, 90 days later BTW. Scam, Scam, Scam...]
