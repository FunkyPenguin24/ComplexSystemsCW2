[100363209622473801389,100746510799793982374,We have purchased 2 cars from this dealership in the past year and a half. While we like our cars, the service department and the dealership as a whole is horrible to deal with. It's basically like the walking dead in there. You would think as a luxury car dealer that "claims" to compete with lexus, mercedes, bmw, etc. that you would be able to get a service loaner that's a Volvo. NO, they give us a Ford festiva or a tiny little enterprise rental car every time. Step up and stop being so cheap. $90K in cars purchased and you can't "afford" to have more than 3 service loaners. Shut down your dealership or sell it, so someone else who cares can operate it. Next time I WILL buy somewhere else. Good job (LOL) at representing a great car with half-hearted service!!!!]
