[112703414824577472032,100002578387220277461,This place was amazing , I went here for dinner and it makes all other food look horrendous! I got the sushi deluxe and it was great! for an appetizer I got a miso soup, seaweed, iced tea (best I`ve ever had.), and six pieces of sushi with 12 other pieces of sushi that was made differently though, for dessert I had a strawberry mochi ice cream which was gone in less than five seconds, and the last part was the little mint. I would have to really recommend this restaurant to anybody. ~~~~~~ 有り難う~~~~~~]
