[115201880969951566775,100827791185234029071,The best restaurants I have ever eaten at don't have a whole lot of "atmosphere." They are known for the GREAT FOOD, the cleanliness and caring of the staff and facilities, and the great prices. Kenny's is one of those restaurants. If you want to eat mouth-watering food where you go back for second and third helpings, are served by caring staff, and are surprised at the price you pay, then Kenny's is the place to go. If you have Kenny cater your event, look forward to plenty of compliments on your choice of caterer. You can be sure that the people who attend your event will remember it and tell you (even months later) how great the food was--and that they got plenty of it.]
