[112548089206587896746,100109675841151138645,Excellent value - best price in town by a long shot (at least, out of the four or so shops we got a quote from). Timely service - job was done the next day. Looks good - you wouldn't be able tell my wife ran the new car into a fence anymore :-) Thanks, Maaco!]
