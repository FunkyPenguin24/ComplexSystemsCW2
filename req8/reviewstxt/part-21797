[105590614995402411627,100156036160468984203,Matt Salling was a pleasure to work with. Matt was my salesman, he gave me good information over the phone prior to my visit. He was attentive,but, not high pressure and was very willing to work through all the details of the sale, making the buying process a smooth one. Further, he took the time to help out on some special issues and out of state registration on the transfer. In addition, he went the extra mile to ensure the car was as prepped as possible in every way. I'd recommend Matt and Brandon Ford for a new or late model used car purchase (I bought a 2012 Genesis with 18k miles).]
