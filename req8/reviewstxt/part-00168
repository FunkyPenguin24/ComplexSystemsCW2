[115259700565935158795,100167537454143479001,I went in for the very first time and had asked if they did walk-ins or by appointment only. The receptionist, who was very friendly, told me by appointment only, but I was able to get in in 30 minutes due to a cancellation. The entire staff is very friendly. Dr. Fleck was very informative and treated me like he had known me for years. I will be picking up my glasses in about a week and I will be going to them from now on.]
