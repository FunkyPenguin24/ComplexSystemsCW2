[102026338215294669146,100154463153837364958,I moved to Brisbane from Sydney 3 years ago and have been a patient of Calm Dental for the last 2.5 years. I have nothing but good things to say about the surgery. All the staff are great - Bella at reception always greats me with a genuine smile and call me old fashion, but I like that Dr. Kham (my dentist) comes out to reception to greet and collect you and escort you in for your treatment. Notwithstanding the quality of care I have received has been excellent and I recommend Calm Dental without hesitation.]
