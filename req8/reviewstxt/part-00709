[100842453537382635530,100196395448878486049,I have never hated living anywhere as much as I hated living at Millcreek Apartments. There is a horrible noise problem. I have a one year old who is woken up at least 3 times a week by cars blaring music outside our apartments. I can literally see my neighbors smoking crack. The cops are here at least once a week. I have made complaints to management and nothing has ever been done about it. Natasha in particular has been increasingly difficult to talk to. I have never met a more disrespectful "community manager" (what a joke!) in my life. We have had tons of problems we asked to be fixed and nothing gets done the first time. And now that our lease is up in 6 weeks I couldn't be happier. I found the perfect apartment in Carlsbad but they wont let me out of my lease 2 weeks early. I really hate this place. We moved here in a hurry because I was pregnant and was due any minute and we needed a place to live. I will never make that mistake again. Do not move here. You will seriously regret it, we did.]
