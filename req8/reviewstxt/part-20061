[106726883200585175785,100063563852681030061,I can't say enough good things about this place. I bought my first acoustic guitar there last week and I will be going back to purchase an electric very soon. They have excellent customer service. They answered all of my questions (no matter how stupid). They also have a great selection and their price on my guitar beat any other place I could find (online or at Guitar Center).]
