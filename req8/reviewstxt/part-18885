[112432313199128055353,100000474627508356351,Time Warner Cable is the biggest crap company ever. Their COMPLIANCE joke of a rep BRANDY is insisting that i prove 36 months of residency to PROVE that I am not asscociated with a bill NOT in my name - and only because i tried to help someone out to open the door to let their cable guy in 4 years ago. Now I can not get service unless I go back and Fax 3 1/2 years of UTILITY BILLS to TWCable. There are so many other reasonable companies like Dish, DirectTV, ATT UVerse. you have to be a GLUTTON for punishment to deal with this company. Don't waste your $1200 a year with this horrific crap service and pathetic excuse for a company.]
