[100331508004488848991,100865533815453767804,Close to inlet. Far enough up the river that you're sheltered. Pretty well marked waterway. Lots of traffic at odd hours. The band up the river sucked, but was quickly drowned out by the live aboard crews. The old people in this marina party way past my bedtime, but at least they are having a good time. Staff was pretty friendly. The ramp is hard to use for large boats on windy days because their gas dock will pinch you off. Still wide enough to thread. The ramp itself though was pretty nice. The rest rooms were clean. I'd visit again.]
