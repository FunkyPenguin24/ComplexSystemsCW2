[107886908833574531856,100945622363378135263,I have been paying good money for my son to live in the Scott Brown properties. Turns out there was suppose to be a permit on his car to park there. Now he has been towed along with the rest of his room mates and they will have to pay 220.00 to get their car back. Plus there is no one in the off site office on the weekends. THIS JUST BLOWS]
