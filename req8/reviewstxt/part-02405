[102981124030956431531,100282830299798058520,Not the worst MetroPCS store i've been to but still pretty bad. Not very knowledgeable of activation procedures, at one point she actually asked me how to do it. Charged me $20 for SIM instead of $10 but at least didnt try to throw on an activation fee.]
