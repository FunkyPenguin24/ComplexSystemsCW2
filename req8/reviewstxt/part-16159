If after you pick your car up it looks like the best cleaning job you could have done in your driveway - it's not done right. Scotty's crew makes the car look better than if it just rolled off the assembly line. I won't EVER hand my keys over to another "professional" detailer again. They have my business as long as I own a vehicle. Don't make the same mistakes many of us have before choosing Scotty's Shine Shop. Go their first and save yourself the headache.]
