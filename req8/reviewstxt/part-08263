[109587372810971770245,100601575922592579994,Taking my laptop to the Laptop Shack was one of the best decisions I've made in terms of efficient, friendly and reasonably-priced computer help. What a wonderful company! My laptop was seriously infected and I thought I would be without a laptop for several weeks, at a great expense. Instead James worked very quickly, and within a week, and at an astonishingly low cost, I had what seems like a brand new laptop. And he did all of this with consummate professionalism, patience, and even good humor. I cannot recommend the Laptop Shack highly enough.]
