[102264076432890467080,100783937594287567673,My family and I stayed in the Killeen Townhomes, the Abigail Drive location for 3 months. We truly loved our experience living there in a fully furnished unit. It had all the "bells and whistles", affordable, comfortable, and spacious. The office staff and the manager were personable, helpful and understanding. I will recommend this living experience to anyone looking for temporary housing, or for those who plan on staying in the Greater Killeen/Fort Hood area for any length of time.]
