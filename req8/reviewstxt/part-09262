[105891092832245671279,100653044332265487785,Dr. Upston has been nothing short of amazing! I have been visiting Dr. Blake for a few years now and from day one he has impressed me. The time he spends on the initial review and explaining what is going on will really show how much he cares. Every visit has been incredible. I am very active with marathons, triathlons, and soccer and Dr has been vital to my health and well being. I have NEVER dealt with any health care professional that treats me more like a friend than a client. I have and will continue to recommend Dr. Upston and his crew to all my friends and family. Thanks Dr!]
