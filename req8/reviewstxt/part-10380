[100575744799275257415,100714131194395222036,This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but has definitely gone down hill in the last 2 years. Had my waiter tell me that they don't blacken the chicken for the salad, when I've gotten that way for years. She actually argued with me that I was wrong, they never blackened. It's not what it used to be. I still go, but half as much as I used to.]
