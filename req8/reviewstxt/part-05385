[107812451373261446264,100445722979146567463,months after this Walmart opened my hair dresser moved to this store so I transferred my Prescriptions and started using this store as my One stop store and dearly loved it.. The last 2-3 times I have been there ALL OF Their Motorized Baskets Have been broken and out of Operation.... Due to a stroke I am unable to Drive, or can not walk very far and have to depend on my daughter to drive me and again today she had to take my list while I sat up front and waited for her. I want to continue to use this store.....But may have to Take all my business elsewhere....perhaps Market Street up the road....From 40 years shopping with United/ Market Street in the Lubbock Area they always have Motorized Baskets Working And available for their Customers]
