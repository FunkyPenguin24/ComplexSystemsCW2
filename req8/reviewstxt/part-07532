[107537034241127231445,100562305947346105924,Started off with Rib appetizers. They fell of the bone. Really good and tender. Also tried the caldo soup. This has a lot of flavor and was really more appealing than I thought of at first. Definitely worth a try. I had the chicken fried rib-eye which was good and tender. Wife had shepherds pie which she could not finish. My son had the pork and beans. The pork tenderloin was worth it for a ten year old. Service was prompt and helpful.]
