[109340603051934413462,100022248972984168575,I've been to Evoo twice for brunch and had an amazing experience! The ambiance is modern, chic, and confortable.The food is incredible and you can taste the high quality. The chef said they buy their food from a local farm. I had pulled pork on french toast (pain dor√©) which I got both times since it was so good! The cute Irish chef came out and delivered our meal which made a personal touch and lasting impression. The last time I went to Evoo I was on a date. I had to choose where to brunch. Since I was so impressed my first visit, I picked Evoo. My date was impressed with me and amazed how I found such a cute place everyone doesn't know about yet. We had a great time. I highly recommend going!]
