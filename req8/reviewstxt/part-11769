[100233058561939101118,100788831896527994400,Went here with a few mates for a general get together. Got there at 7.30 and ordered a Chicken Parmy as did all my mates. Was a bit pricey considering I would call this place a fancy pub, but then again, this place is in the city. It took over an hour for the Parmys to rock up at our table and it certainly wasn't busy in the restaraunt. They had gotten my order wrong and given me a Beef Parmy instead of a Chicken. I certainly wasn't going to complain but the waitress quite literally pulled the plate out of my hand and whisked it off to the kitchen without an apology of any kind. 10 minutes later my Chicken Parmy rocked up and all was good. The food itself was very good, one of the best parmys I've ever had however a bit of salad on the plate wouldn't go amiss. Overall would recommend this place to someone wanting to try a lot of different types of Coopers beers however their are much better and cheaper places to go.]
