[101106260915948696852,100675190083528127302,I went in to meet with Christian and she was with another client, so Gabriel helped me out. He was EXTREMELY helpful in every aspect. We test drove and when I decided it was the car I wanted we found the color and crunched numbers. When we realized I was not going to be able to afford that car, he did not hesitate to take me out to look at others. I decided on one and realized I really wanted a certain color. We drove all over the lot looking for it because his boss had told him t was there. I think he was just as excited as I was to find it. We came in and he really worked with me to be able to afford the car. All the while, Christian was coming over and checking on me. She sat there through most of the process.I finally got to go into financing with Christine and she told me I had the opportunity to purchase the car, which was so exciting. She patiently waited as I called my husband to talk it over. She did not pressure me at all. I am SOOOOOO appreciative for her giving me this opportunity. She called and had them put a protector all over my new car. She even gave me demonstrations of how these would protect my car. When I went to see my car all cleaned up and ready to go, Christian and Gabriel had noticed that it had some water spots and said they have told several people and would set up an appointment to have it completely fixed! They were confident it would not put me out at all. They reassured me that I could get a loaner car during the process so I did not have to miss any work or anything.Everyone I dealt with was very helpful and kind during my experience. I would highly recommend them!]
