[100919039059984244096,101010601237781009377,This may look like a 'run of the mill' cafe on first glance, offering standard coffee and pasteries. However, this place is one of those little gems you only find now and again. It is run by a portuguese family, and retains that family touch, very friendly service and really reasonable prices. The coffee here is brilliant (They import it from Portugal.), and the pateis de nata is great. At the back of the cafe they sell lots of portuguese produce including bacalau and frozen foods. Downstairs they have a cellar with the best selection of protuguese wine in London 'apparently'. Definitly recommend this]
