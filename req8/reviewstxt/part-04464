[116332003407220115089,100395863688758295961,In my opinion, Cornell Jewelers is the worst Jewelry store in the Rochester area. I was in the market for an engagement ring, and I had been to 9 different jewelry stores. I visited Cornell’s several times and was working closely with a sales woman there. On my fourth visit to look at some diamonds, I was not satisfied with what the sales woman was showing me so I asked to look at some different type of diamonds. When she figured out that she couldn’t close the deal she brought the owner of the store out (instead of bringing out the diamonds I was asking for). The owner sat down and talked my ear off about random diamond stuff (keep this in mind – this was the second time this sales woman had brought the owner out to speak with me). As soon as I told them what my budget was and that I wanted to shop around for pricing, the owner told me he would not bring out anymore diamonds for me to look at and said that I was not giving him any incentive to want to work with him. Bottom line is, they just want to sell you on the diamonds they have in the store already, they don’t want to spend the time to find the diamond you really want, and it really seems like they only want to work with you if you are purchasing a six figure diamond. Very rude, talk too much about stuff you don’t care about, don’t listen to you. I have more to tell about this place but I don’t want to be long winded. Go to any other Jewelry store!]
