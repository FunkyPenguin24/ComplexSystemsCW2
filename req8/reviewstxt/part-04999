[110590135209110886425,100423036537518985003,This place has good pizza. It takes about 30 for it to be made although its worth it. The drinks were not that good honestly. It looked dumpy inside, total ghost town, surprised this place is still running. Might need a heath inspector or something, this place looked dirty. I should have got my order to-go.]
