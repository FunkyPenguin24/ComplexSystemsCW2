[100007681906653005662,100818300204509363927,7/20/13: Had a horrible experience. Came in for my appointment the receptionist was on the phone, patiently waited in a chair after she hangs up with another customer she tells me my appointment was at 5:45 p.m. when it actually was for 6:15 p.m. I tell her this and she lets me know they might not be able to shampoo my hair. I just simply stated I had an appointment for 6:15 p.m. and that I really needed my hair washed. She then starts to argue with me that I came in at 6:25 p.m. I calmly told her I was 3 minutes late. I came in at 6:18 p.m. and she tells me "no you didn't, didn't I just see you walk in?! I couldn't believe it. I just remained seated and waited for the next person to approach me. I was so uncomfortable and unfortunately I really needed my appointment badly. After that I was just on pins and needles. I called the company and left a message to talk to a manager. I never received a returned call. I also filled out their survey and explained the situation and asked for someone to call me and I still never received a call back.]
