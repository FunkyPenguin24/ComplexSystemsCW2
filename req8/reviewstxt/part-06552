[110596127747058672235,100507393403661887508,What's not to love? My most recent samplings included Chargrilled Caesar Salad, Fried Green Tomato BL, & Catfish Fingers - who knew catfish had fingers?! Great southern food, wide selection of draught and bottled beer, wine, full liquor bar, and all in a welcoming atmosphere. My last dinner visit we listened the local band "One Street Over" and they were awesome! Lots of music, friendly staff, kids' menu too!]
