[110745899977030407397,100952001785774057026,I just bought a 2012 Mazda CX-9. From Sales to Finance and Service, this dealership both took the time to listen and also made the process as speedy and simple as possible for the sale. They listened to what I wanted specifically, took notes and found the vehicle I wanted within the price range I wanted and made the deal work for me! I would and will recommend them to friends and family. Thank you Garrett and Steven for awesome collaboration. Rick (Frederick) Curbelo]
