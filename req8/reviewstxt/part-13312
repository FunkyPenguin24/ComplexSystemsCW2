[106047709148242038504,100874664489506927760,I was referred to Fitness Together by a friend. She had tremendous weight loss success with the trainers at FT; specifically Eli. My method of staying fit was running but I had recently hit a plateau in my fitness level. Was I a hire-a-personal-trainer-type of person? I wasn't sure but was convinced to try it out. After 13 weeks at Fitness Together, I wonder what took me so long. I feel stronger and have dropped two dress sizes. All the trainers are wonderful in their specific training style. My primary trainer, Eli, has encouraged me and taken a personal interest in me and all his clients. The results are priceless.]
