[118058162894324452331,100202798115368413056,The family love going there to eat. Mostly during lunch. Has a rather nice sushi set up and quite the selection. The noodle selection was great. The coconut shrimp hot, The fresh muscles and garlic steamer clams was nice and the fruit and ice cream was nice. The traditional dishes was also there. Staff was very courtesy and the waitress was spot on it from keeping the table clean to giving us the check. Kudos for the Asian Staff and the Chinese food... Rate *****]
