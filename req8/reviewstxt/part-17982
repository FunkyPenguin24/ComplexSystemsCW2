[118082603133243732777,101128127482116423544,We stayed here after the last night launch for the space shuttle. Rooms are clean, the staff is friendly and is great value at $46/night, with the AAA discount. And, the breakfast buffet is just $9.00, and is good! Will return on my next road trip passing through Orlando.]
