[104227643793822960131,100892612779426154375,Bad bad bad. So bad I had to blog about & take a photo. Will be contacting corporate office to let them know how bad this place was. I'm from California, and while traveling before this incident = "Oh, Subway; let's grab lunch." After Incident: = "Remember that Subway in Moses Lake, and how cheap and condescending they were... let's skip Subway all together." - Totally disgusted by the Subway in Moses Lake, WA who seem to take pride in providing the very least to their customers. "Sir, that's how we're told to do it," seem to be the oft repeated phrase when I complained that there was practically no lettuce, and when I mentioned the pathetic amount of olives, I was told I was only supposed to get 3 olive slices on each half of a foot long. That is about 1/2 an olive per side. Want more, pay 40 cents more. Jared should be ashamed that the corporate value of least is alive and well at Subway. The manager was kind enough to point out that because I had more than three olive bits, I was getting free extra olives. Wow, am I not McLovin' the Subway generosity. Also on the rant, they can't even make an italian BMT look like the photo on the menu bar. They don't show iceberg lettuce on the menu photo, but that's all they have in the store. L*A*M*E.]
