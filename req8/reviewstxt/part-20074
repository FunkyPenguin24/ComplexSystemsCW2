[104360361358925166076,100064360331065595859,I ordered artichoke ravioli with white and red sauce. The white sauce was thick goop tht tasted like it came out of a can. The red sauce was less yucky but still tasted canned. I asked the waitress and she said that corporate insisted that they used premade sauces. Even if it is made by corporate or wherever, it is still canned and had no flavor. They lost me as a customer. I won't pay money to eat at a restaurant that uses premade food.]
