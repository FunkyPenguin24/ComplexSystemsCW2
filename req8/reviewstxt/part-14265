[115692093210888893250,100926234029948831211,I have suffered from lower back pain for 11 years. In May of 2012 I strained my back and went back to my chiropractor for a regular adjustment. Usually, 3 or 4 adjustments and I'd be OK. Not this time. After suffering all summer long I finally decided it was time to do something different. I heard about Dr. Reeb and spinal decompression, but I was skeptical. So I decided to check it out and made an appointment. Dr. Reeb was great - and walked me through everything! After getting an X-ray of my back, he recommended his non surgical spinal decompression. I did a little of my own research and everything he told me was confirmed by what I read and those I spoke with. Of course the best part - my back pain went away after only the first few treatments! With the occasional adjustment - I'm still feeling pretty good. Dr. Reeb and his staff provide an excellent family atmosphere and I cannot recommend them enough!]
