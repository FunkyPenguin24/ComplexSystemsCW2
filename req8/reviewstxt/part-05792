[105698703877582974037,100466275199188623423,I ate at the one in Norman regularly when I was at OU, and this is the same joint, pretty much. The burgers are great, perfectly cooked with some great quasi-gourmet options, and their queso is fantastic. I always get the sriracha blue cheese burger. It get pretty packed so finding a table can be hard, but these are easily the best restaurant burgers I've ever had.]
