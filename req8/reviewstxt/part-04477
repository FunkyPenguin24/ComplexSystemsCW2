[100512712076578793412,100396798302758010113,I have tried them in the past in Vegas. The first time I ate at the new location in Austin, I was underwhelmed. I thought it was not as good as in the past. This most recent time I thought it was really good. They might have worked out the kinks since the opening. It is a good fast food burger. Take that however you want to take that. I like their fries and it's cool they serve sweet tea here. I do not like P. Terry's and think they are a ripoff of In-N-Out. I will be back.]
