[105235542649292167499,100567105732269826790,The food / decor / other stuff Is very important to a restaurants experience obviously, but service is something that can make or break a good place. We were a group of 4 and waited for 10 minutes to be seated, as it was rush hour. We were able to order after another 15 minutes as no one attended or paid any attention. The waiter then rather rudely told us to order whatever we wanted in one go, as he was 'busy and can't take orders every few minutes'. Food took a long while to arrive and was good, but we were so pissed with the unwelcome demeanor that we decided to not come again. Side Note: Do Not order chicken or veg patties here. Worst way to start your day.]
