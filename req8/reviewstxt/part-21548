[105762821986690901775,100142289017108725758,We've had Randy work on our car a couple of times and he always does a fantastic job! He's very thorough, quick and charges an honest price. We never leave there feeling like we've been ripped off, and I really appreciate that. So many shops I've been to try to take advantage of me because I'm a woman, but Randy is not like that. I'm so glad we found his shop because I finally have someone I trust other than my dad to fix our vehicles. I also found out he does the work for our church bus and van, so that's a pretty good recommendation right there!]
