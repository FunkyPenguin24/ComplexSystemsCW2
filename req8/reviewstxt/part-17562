[104347003661226591282,101106368220886738085,Might be bias because I've seen so many great shows there (Amy Winehouse, Keane, Muse, Broken Social Scene, Keane...) but I've listened to the same bands at different venues and they just don't sound as good. Mod Club has one of the greatest sound systems in the city. Unpretentious and beautiful. Love this place.]
