[117555244115127476255,101097456551159072912,During mid-February I noticed that my "check engine" light was illuminated on my 2009 Chevrolet HHR. My vehicle was required to go through MA state inspection by the end of February. I didn't have time to get it repaired before the deadline so I submitted the vehicle knowing I would be issued a "rejection" sticker and also knowing I would have 60 days with which to resolve the issue. On March 20th, I called Central Chevrolet to request an appointment to make repairs and was told they could take my vehicle in the next day. I dropped it off around 9:00AM and I received a call that the vehicle was ready for pick-up just a few short hours later! They replaced two parts (One part was covered under warranty). The check engine light is obviously no longer illuminated and I can now take my vehicle to be re-inspected well before the April 18th deadline as indicated by the MA State inspection facility. Thank you Central Chevrolet!]
