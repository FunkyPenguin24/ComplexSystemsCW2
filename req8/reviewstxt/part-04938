[103226132209834102130,100420055514811260682,I would echo others' comments on entrance needing a little work, getting fit walking those stairs and the fast internet. The internet did not work immediately, but the owners and the unit's contact person were quick and very responsive in getting it up and running. It was much appreciated given I was there on business. (great location for getting to Austria Centre).]
