[106491925510493339054,100627312159806121097,The pharmacist at this location is terrible.I guess "customer service" classes aren't a requirement for a pharmacology degree. I've dealt with this Rite Aid for the past couple of prescription refills and each time the lady tells me (in terrible broken English) "Herro, NO your prescriptions is na reaty yet, roo need to kah yo docta fo da refeel" And each time she has been completely wrong. If she would just look at the computer and DO HER JOB, she would see that my prescription was IN FACT sent over electronically the day before. Never once does an apology follow...fire this woman or I'll transfer to Walgreens.]
