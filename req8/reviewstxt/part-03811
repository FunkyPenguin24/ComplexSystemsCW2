[115396875856314829430,100359373083868606259,Dr Jill Bronz is an amazing veterinarian and our family veterinarian for about 10 years. She recognized a problem my one beagle had with his kidneys and she discovered the cause. The beagle boy was 11 years old and I thought we would lose him. Thanks to her, not only has his kidneys returned to normal he is acting and living a happy puppy life two years later! He has more energy at 13 years old than he did when he was 6 years old. Dr Bronz also performed surgery on one of our other beagles and thank goodness she identified early something we had not noticed. If we had waited just six more months, we could have had a more serious outcome for our beagle. Now he is back to normal and full of energy! Dr Bronz is one of the best in the Valley. She has a caring staff dedicated and focused on the well-being of the animal.]
