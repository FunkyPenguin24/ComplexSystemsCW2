[114036027773655616770,100516704022805012518,Went there on a Wednesday night with my wife to celebrate a belated Valentines day dinner. Despite the fact that there was only one other table occupied that night we were treated with an excellent meal and very good service. We ordered the Bistro for Two which was generous and arrived at our table sizzling We were concerned that we were holding up their closing but we're never rushed but instead treated to some free dessert. We will definitely be back on a day we can expect a larger crowd of people and perhaps some live music.]
