[101894290610132180574,100532721469865645118,Really takes me back to when I was a kid. The service we received and the experience was wonderfully nostalgic! From the low cost, ample selection of concessions(also reasonably priced), and the ticket number drawings for prizes done by the owners themselves... DEFINITELY was a very fun, happy mood, always welcome here type of feeling that you could never experience at the big theaters. Not only was I excited to see the movie on my way there, I also felt very happy to be where I was while I was there! 10 out of 10 guys! Thanks so much for making the movie going experience as exciting as it was when I was a child! :-)]
