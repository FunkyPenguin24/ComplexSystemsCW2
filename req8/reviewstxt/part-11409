[113825147791570014174,100769421149887069117,If I lived in Vermont, this is where I would take my vehicle. I was traveling from out of town with a vehicle whose company is no longer (Saab). After a couple failed attempts at starting my car, I had it towed to this garage. The quickly diagnosed the problem (bad starter), had a dealer part overnight'd, and had the repair complete as expected. I returned the next day because my brake light was on. Apparently a bleeder valve was not tightened all the way from a prior service with my mechanic at home. They took me in without an appointment and remedied this problem while I waited. As a father of three girls, I could appreciate the vibe of the shop.]
