[103475168778544859867,100508404569356053095,I have been a patient of Dr. Zare's for over a year. I originally visited for a pain in my back but have moved on to other issues. Dr. Zare has helped me control my acid reflux as well as helped me improve my diet. I find the idea of health maintenance very helpful. Like any machine, our body needs regular maintenance, Dr. Zare has helped improve my quality of life by helping me maintain my body. It is worth the time to visit her.]
