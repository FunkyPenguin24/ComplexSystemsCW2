There are a couple good things, but as a whole, most of the selections are pretentious and overly done for a neighborhood tavern. The side salad is a great example of this. Not much in the way of "bar food" here, outside of the wings, which are awesome. Would love to see an updated menu with some comfort food type items like a bar pizza or mac and cheese or familiar appetizers in general. Avoid anything with chili, or any breakfast that includes eggs. The beer selection however, is awesome. The decor is also great, with plenty of TVs and just about any game on you'd want to watch. The service is hit and miss, although you soon learn who the friendly bartenders are, and who to avoid. Service on busy football Saturdays and Sundays is almost always really good.]
