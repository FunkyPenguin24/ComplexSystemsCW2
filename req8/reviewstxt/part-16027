[108193145478086790955,101022279710438492529,So far I have had to visit three times in the past year. I drive a 1999 Silverado, with 210000 miles, so all the work they have done is to replace original factory parts. January 4th, as I was driving to work, my power steering went out, and the engine started to oveheat. I brought it into them, and they show me the original water pump, factory installed in 1998, had died. It is a 60000 mile part. I got 205000. Total charges were about 300 bucks including labor and taxes. Back in early September, my power steering went out again (I didn't have them fix it in January), and they diagnosed the power steering pump, also factory original was done. A leaking line had dried and fried the system. My fault for not having it fixed earlier when they told me about it. Total cost was about 500 bucks. Just this past week, I was driving and my truck completely stalled out and wouldn't even crank. Diagnosis: Fuel pump (factory original, with a 100000 mile warranty) and fuel filter (also a factory original, which I never got around to changing due to being overseas for most of the previous nine years) were shot. They replaced both within a day of me dropping off the truck, total cost 650 bucks. Not bad considering what a car payment each month would be. Also not bad considering maintenance was not properly done/documented while I was overseas. These guys have done nothing but quality work for me. It is a bit pricey, but I'd rather spend 1400 dollars over a year in maintenance than pay 500-800 bucks a month on a car note and insurance. These guys have earned my business for as long as I live in the area.]
