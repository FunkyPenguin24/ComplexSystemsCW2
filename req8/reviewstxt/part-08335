[103626032001340241162,100605414925157368457,My favourite pub in the area. They serve lovely food that's not only delicious, but is amazingly served. Even having sausages and mash, which now I have had 3 times, they serve it with a small sprig of parsley. Overall an amazing pub, with lovely people,waitresses and waiters. If you are looking for a friendly pub for special occasions and a pint of lager, this is the place to go.]
