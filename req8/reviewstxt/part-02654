[103639346332092446484,100295664894292793328,Popped in to see Avatar 14/1/10, screen 11 I think, and it all went very smoothly. On my Dayrider going in to Leeds I was thinking of course of all the things that could go wrong smelling my armpits, and I wanted the best possible position in the house, eye level, on a par with the screen. I got it. A seat perpendicular to the screen and sound system with my 3D glasses for 7.25. Your bogs are clean and tidy, your Staff helpful and informative, but why do people sit on the back row or near walls or under the screen? It felt like my own private Cinema. My only comment as a critic... My English teacher back in the 70's said a critic is positive. So there I am sat right in the middle of your Cinema. I'd give the storyline of Avatar a B+, slightly change the balance of sound to my left, the picture a wow factor and apart from that, Rock on Dude.]
