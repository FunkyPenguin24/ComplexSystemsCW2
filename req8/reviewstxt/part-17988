[115921255320731944135,101128522081646254107,The food here is very good and the restaurant is owned by a Thai family, so I'm not sure where that one user got the idea that the food is bland or inauthentic. I am a big fan of the Tom Yum, the Wantons, and the Basil Dish. All to die for. In terms of a Thai restaurant in Wyoming, the standards are not going to be very high, but I'd say you'd find similar quality and taste at a good Thai restaurant in Ft. Collins or Denver.]
