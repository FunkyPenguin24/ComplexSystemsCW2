[112055142892510406376,100512711546339257865,I had LASIK surgery on November 28, 2013 and traveled from Washington, D.C. to have the surgery completed. The Whiting Clinic is truly world class and from every step of the way you know that you are in good hands. My one month follow up appointment was with Dr. Whiting himself and I could not ask for a better Health Care Provider. I now have 20/10 vision in both eyes and have had zero issues. I tell all of my Midwest and East Coast friends that if they are interested in having LASIK the trip to Minnesota to see Dr. Whiting is 100% worth the travel expense.]
