[102458787772039767001,100943726102434793383,I was in the market for a new vehicle and had test-drive many brands including Honda. I had a suv and wanted a car. All of the cars seats dipped even with power seats wouldn't tilt forward enough for my short legs to sit comfortable. Mohamed a salesmen answered an email request. I came in, test drove Accord and Civic they were nice and I like them but again the seats were uncomfortable for my short legs he suggested the CR-V. The seats were straighter and more upright which felt better to my legs. Once I decided to get it Dean worked with me on getting an excellent rate. April was great on explaining the warranties and Erica with the signing of all my paper work and explaining my total cost, trade in, discounts and taxes. They even informed me about the New Honda Owners gathering they have for new owners. I would recommend Sheehy Honda.]
