[108283784390929493054,100337729082683533556,Fantastic restaurant! We had dinner out at Mi Dia this week and were not disappointed in the slightest bit. The restaurant is independently owned and features dishes that go beyond Tex Mex - special entrees have influence from Mexico City and Sante Fe - very nice! If we had one critique, it would be that they do not accept reservations. The wait on Friday around 7:00pm was an hour and a half - so get there early if you don't like the wait.]
