[103608399530246938309,101111227702294603939,Unity handled our recent move from Raleigh NC to Simpsonville, SC. I could not have been more pleased. Our belongings were handled with great care and the staff was courteous. The team on the Raleigh end worked very efficiently. Although there was very little discussion between team members, with Marcos as team leader, everything just went like clockwork. Two members (Juan and Roger) of the moving team were also with us on the Greenville end. Again, everything was done with great care and efficiency. I have and will continue to recommend this company for anyone that I know is moving. Moving can be a nightmare if you don't have the right people assisting you. Unity/Raleigh Movers was definitely the right company to help us with our move.]
