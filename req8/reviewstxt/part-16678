[100641154075545301012,101057898408878072612,I known James since 1994 before he became an attorney , and all i know is when he passed his bar and was an Attorney , in 2001 i was arrested for something that could of landed me in prison for 50 years. James got all charges thrown out and saved my life and even had 1 charge which was a misdemenor , he had then withheld judication so I was never convicted.. I am a Mortgage Professional , business owner, and active Real Estate Investor IN DUVAL COUNTY, since that day James had changed my Life. James is also great at Tickets and anything that needs to be striken from the record so my future can be intact .. I thank the LORD I met James cause he is the best attorney I have ever encountered in my life .. I use James for all my attorney needs and hopefully for the rest of my life as long as he stays alive.. On top of that, his assistant ANNA is the best in the world , Smart , and drop dead GORGEOUS!!! That helps when your waiting in the lobby lol He is a GODSEND and I recommened anyone to challenge my statement , he will save your BUTT!!! I have the cases and the proof . thanks Big James]
