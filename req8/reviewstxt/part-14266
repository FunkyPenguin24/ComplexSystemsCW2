[105891117694276454007,100926239866917759146,My wife and I have been back many times. The food and service have been consistently good. We've had spring rolls, crisp-fried tofu, rotis, vegetarian fried rice: all very well done. Good choice of wine. Low prices and good service. Modest surroundings that go with the prices. This place is excellent value.]
