[115090052604991186597,100843264702526614729,Tired to have dinner there tonight and they wouldn't let me in. I got there at 9:30 pm, and they close at 10:00 pm. After walking 3 miles in a blizzard storm here in buffalo, NY. They had people still at tables with menus in there hands that must have arrived no more than 5 mins before me. As I knocked a short fat man with a blue Buffalo bills hoody said they were closed. My reply was I have just walked 3 miles in this storm to try you wings that I have heard about from all the locals. Can I come in for a second to get warm, and was told no, and with a shit-eating grin on his face said sorry and then turned around to go sit his fat ass down at the bar. Never have a met a more rude, and non-compassionate person. I am here in town on business and only have a few days to see the town. Where I'm from small business go the extra mile to help out those in similar predicaments. So the way they treated me, was not of a customer minded mentality. But, of a company that has become out of touch with the people and has gotten to big for there britches in the claim that they invented "Chicken Wings." There management is terrible at best if they employee people, and practice business such as these. I hope that if your in Buffalo, NY you don't waste your time on going there. I hope that they read this, and have the gumption to contact me. So they may make this right, if not they are truly deserving of this review.]
