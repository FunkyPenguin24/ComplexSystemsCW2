[100330867842389356443,100532057607229330584,these guys are a joke. i went there cause they had a huge selection of frames. however i soon found out the employees that work there are snobs. even the manager lady is a jerk. also my apparently "bulletproof" polycarbonate lenses were scratched and now even though they are under warranty i have to pay 160 bucks to replace them? no thanks. if you want to be pushed around by a bunch of bitchy women this is the place for you! ill go buy some frames off zenni optical (greatest website ever) and get free lenses....all for 25 bucks.]
