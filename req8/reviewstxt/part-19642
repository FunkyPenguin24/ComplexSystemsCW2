[106459796146545363064,100040938989751187178,This place is a great "hole in the wall" type. I go with my co-workers occasionally when the weather is good (lots of outdoor seating). The smoking pit is outside on the front porch next to the seating area, so you can frequently chat up the cooks while chowing down on the grub.]
