[104580045500794196896,100542637094726586082,I went to the nearest PEP Boys while I was traveling as I detected something wrong with my front end. Since I just had my brakes done a month ago at another location in Florida, I thought they could make sense of it as the brake light kept coming on. They were nice a polite but could not identify the problem, first thinking it was electrical and I insisted it was mechanical. The manager and I went on a brief test drive after the vehicle had sat almost an hour and cooled down. The noise would only slightly duplicate and he felt it was safe to continue my travel. Not a couple of miles away after leaving the noise returned (obviously from heated expanding metal). I found a Good Year dealer in the area who put their finger right on it. My right front spindle was torn up, right rotor was being eaten up and brakes affected as well. Had I continued my trip, my wheel would have come off my axle in a short time. For oil changes and tires, PEP Boys are great, but they should not be in the general repair business. For example, while I was waiting over an hour, their was a mechanic hammering away at two license plate bolts trying to get the old rusted bolts off. Over an hour of labor to deal with two screws???]
