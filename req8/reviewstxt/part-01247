[102570407378168609411,100223545648597867609,I was very happy with Dr. Wilson and I will continue to take my animals to him. Every person that worked there was kind, gentle and very informative. Monkey came home after they removed his left leg, he ate all of his food and slept well. During the night my baby boy got up 3 times to eat and drink. I cant thank Dr. Wilson enough for the time he took with me and my new kitty. Monkey Nut "was" a feral cat, he is now "my" cat! He will never feel the winter cold, the summer heat or ever go hungrey again. He may have lost a leg, but he scored pretty big with me as his new forever Mama. Thanks again to Dr. Wilson and his wonderful staff!!!]
