[107298357495389137496,100192384828132115998,I have been to Starbucks in DC, NYC, Chicago, Singapore, Tokyo, London, and Australia, to name a few, and this location I can confidently say is the "worst Starbucks I have been to in the entire world." The service is slow, the staff is rude, they frequently are more entertained by their side conversations then their job, and the drinks are more often than not made incorrectly. For the past year I have observed such poor service that Starbucks corporate should fire the entire team and replace them. The single good thing about this place is the number of free drinks I get because they mange to get my simple order incorrect every other time I go.]
