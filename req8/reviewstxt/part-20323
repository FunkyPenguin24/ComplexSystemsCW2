[118180667243868710247,100077156466453723897,It was my first visit to Elden Family Dental seeing Doctor Meer today. As much as I have had problem with my teeth over years (ever since I was 15 ) I must say, that I am MUCH picky on my dentist. I just moved to Reston and sure was very nervous to see new dentist, but I found Dr. Meer exceptionally professional, kind and caring. He valued his patient, explained the problem, took his time way over the limit to care for my not so well teeth and gum. In my opinion Dr. Meer is a young professional dentist who kindly took time to take care of his patient well. I already have decided to take my daughter back to his office and recommended him to my family and friends. Thank you Dr. Meer ! Job WELL done !]
