Slow and rude service, the fried fish was watery, chips were soggy, not licensed, and if you want a glass for a soft drink, you have to buy four plastic cups for a dollar. Cutlery consists of disposable plastic forks, though the bent tines on my fork suggest that it may have been through the dishwasher I assume that the person who named this "Best Fish and Chips, seven years running" was Horrible Henry, the Headless Hobgoblin who, lacking all organs of taste, wants humans to suffer because they have a sense of taste. The claim "grilled in garlic, chilli and rosemary" is NOT satisfied by slopping some sauce over the fish after it is done. We noticed too late that the Wharf Restaurant next door offered a light lunch for $20--we had dinner there several nights earlier, and everything was excellent.]
