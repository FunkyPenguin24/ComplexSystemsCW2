I mean, just great, especially for the price! And on Sunday they have a wonderful supper menu for a fixed price that looks scrumptious! I can't wait until Sunday! :-) I had the CUBAN MOJO CHICKEN SKEWERS (w/mojo sauce + cilantro + platanos maduros) and the MARINATED BEET SALAD (w/ toasted walnuts + valdeon + olive oil + chives) and was pleasantly surprised at how tasty everything was! I'm also pleased to find a place that offers such a wide variety of items that are affordable when eating alone. I would definitely recommend this spot!]
