[101656365469168710128,100176109303143800402,These guys are crooks, pure and simple. Bought a "Rust free" ford excursion from them. Looked it over during a snow storm, and towed it back to Georgia. The next day I get underneath the truck and 1 hour later and 2 five gallon buckets of rust flakes later I get out from under it. What these crooks did wasrubber sprayed over the rust, then painted over the spray. Then it blew a power steering line, again, from rust, then blew the brake lines...that was after all four calipers siezed on it. In the last 2 years, I put 500 miles on it. Avoid them. When I got the truck the owner was talking about how he was doing burnouts in a 6.0 powerstroke, then it was leaking coolant and blew the turbo. He cleaned it up and put it out front to be sold. Please, save your money and go somewhere else. As for the excursion, I bought another one to transfer the drivetrain over to.]
