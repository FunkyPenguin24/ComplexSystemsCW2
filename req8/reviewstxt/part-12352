[110261028720019640963,100820619823106899523,NOT impressed. The chiropractor himself gave the indication they would be able to work things out re payement plans instead of the insurance but then the admin suggested we find another chiropractor!!! I did get a phone call from the owner (well done) when I called to complain but "we're sorry for the confusion" does nothing to help cover expenses that are pointless since we have to find another chiropractor anyway......steer clear as they don't stick to their word.]
