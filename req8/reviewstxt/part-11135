[107118950771338733924,100755157921032474114,This is top shelf Mexican Food in a small mom and pop atmosphere. Seriously the best I've had in Albuquerque. The service is friendly and efficient. Plates are made to order so good things come to those that are a bit patient but the chips and salsa are excellent while you wait. The shrimp enchiladas are amazing, Steak Ranchero very tasty (great sauce), Steak pico burrito is solid especially when smothered with red sauce and you won't want to miss the carne adovada enchiladas nor the chile rellenos. There are so many excellent things on the menu you'll have to keep coming back to sample them, like the fish tacos.]
