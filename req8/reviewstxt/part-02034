[116004296068530481649,100264140587238387081,My Saturn Ion was under recall for the ignition switch issue and my car was stopping while driving so I wanted to get it checked out. Twice I called and Rotolo Chevrolet told me there was no recall. Finally I called the Chevrolet headquarters and they got involved. Three days later, after calling at least twice a day with no response I finally get a hold of someone who was able to tell me the issue was not the recall. I wanted to fix the problem myself, so I went to pick up the car. The service manager did not know if it was ready and could not get anyone to tell her if it was. I ended up leaving my car over the weekend. The diagnosis they gave me, which I paid for, was very vague, so when I picked the car up Monday I asked the technician if the service coordinator could call me the next day to give a more detailed diagnosis. A week later and no one has ever called and I'm out $100 for nothing!]
