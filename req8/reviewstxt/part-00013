[111859110809915663872,100159530983942796307,The cheesesteak sandwiches here were fair to good. Nothing special. I did not care for the bread. The sandwich with provolone barely had any cheese on it. Definitely not enough to call it a "cheese"steak. The sandwich with Cheese Whiz had the distinct flavor of a can. My iced tea was either stale or tasted like Chandler water. Chocolate chip cookie looked yummy, but was a no go, as well. The service was good enough. There wasn't really anything here that would make me want to return.]
