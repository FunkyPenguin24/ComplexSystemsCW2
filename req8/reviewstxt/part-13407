[104776904536144838379,100879785493534677438,When I moved to the area, I started a membership so that I could access the 100 yard range for rifle load development and handgun practice in the pistol bays. I enjoy going out to the range (range officers keep the noobs in check and ensure safety and all), and I also enjoy coming back to the "lobby" where they usually have coffee/bathrooms, and plenty of merchandise to buy/check out, and plenty of hunting stories to share. I recently attended one of Steve's private CHL courses that we had organized for my SQ. Aside from a good marketing pitch, Steven spent much time combing through state laws in the classroom portion and running through scenarios with us on the range portion and left no question unanswered. Other than that, they always greet me verbally when I walk in, and that is just really cool when you visit a laid back gun store. I am looking forward to the range expansion coming up!]
