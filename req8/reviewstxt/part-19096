[111284030867263374493,100010830367606431344,I've been going to Mammoth Comics for almost 10 years, I love the place, the environment is great, very welcoming, whoever is running the counter is always a joy to talk to and sound interested and happy to answer any questions you may have about a book. I highly recommend Mammoth Comics, you really won't find better stock or friendlier service anywhere else and that's a fact! As for the guy claiming that the owner is a crook and that crooks run the place, it sounds like he has never even been to Mammoth Comics.]
