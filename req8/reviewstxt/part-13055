[100040195626216550092,100860110365478717742,I've had a membership at Aspire for a year... it is a good place. They have great child care that's included with a membership, which is awesome for me. Other than that, its a pretty standard, full-featured gym... It gets busy around 6ish in the morning, and between 5-6 p.m... which is pretty typical at any gym. All-in-all... a good, solid gym.]
