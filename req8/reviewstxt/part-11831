[109147208999382214743,100792334019076473590,After a failed attempt and treating my shoulder injury with another Physiotherapist, I came in to see Sean and the team at Healthfix Physiotherapy, McMahons Point. What I love about Healthfix is their passion and approach to treating your problem addressing the issues from a bio-mechanical perspective then working with various techniques (postural, massage, stretching etc) to correct the problem. I was due for shoulder surgery but after only 3 visits I'm feeling more confident that I won't have to go under the knife at all! I still have a long way to go but I feel confident I'm in good hands with my journey to recovery in a much more conservative manner! Sean even spent the time talking through my diagnosis with my personal trainer at the gym as to avoid aggravating it and called my Orthopedic surgeon's rooms to get a report on my exact symptoms and condition so he could treat me accordingly. I would definitely recommend Healthfix Physiotherapy to anyone who want's results from a physio who genuinely cares about your recovery and not one that just wants your money and to push you out the door!
