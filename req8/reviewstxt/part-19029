[101587451978256702592,100007390874154531056,We love Thai Basil...even our kids love it. They love the potsitckers (actually enough for 2 to share) and the edamame. We love eveything else. We've been there 4 times now and not run in to anything we don't like, although the pad thai is especially good. Great choice, not all thai which is nice. Highly recommend it!]
