[106964481974200498547,101040571798329901850,For nearly two decades we recommend this unique park to all our guests travelling on the Trans Canada to meet animals they might not see on their trip. Our son Tobias (had stayed at the sanctuary near Smithers too) also learned about First Nations (music). Bravo to owners and staff!
