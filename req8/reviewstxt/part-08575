[110899945964567200195,100616808917576882480,Had a pump go out on my spa recently. Tom and his crew were able to get me a refurbished pump at a great price. Everything got set up and placed in the spa but for some reason it still did not work. Carefree sent someone to the house who discovered what the problem was, cleaned up the work and fixed it. The problem was a result of mis-wiring and the work was done at no additional charge to me. My wife and I were very grateful for the quality and timeliness of the work and are thrilled to have the hot tub back in working order. Thank you Carefree Spas]
