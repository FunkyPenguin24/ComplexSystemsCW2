[116413950813793945745,100129420267395043597,I'm a lefty living in Melbourne and I wanted to buy a Gretsch G5191 TA model. Nothing anywhere to be found in Melbourne, so I did some be-Googling....which is how I found The Guitar Lounge. First, I rang Robert to have some questions answered about the guitar I was looking at it. It was clear from the get-go that this bloke knows his guitars. He answered all my questions, particularly in relation to sound difference between Gretsch models, and between semi-hollows v solid body etc.. I explained to him what feel and sound I was after, and he suggested some suitable options. Most importantly, he didn't try to sell me something I didn't want/need. It was clear that he was more concerned that I got the right guitar for me, rather than the right guitar for his budgets :) Being Melbourne based, I was initially quite hesitant to buy from an interstate shop without testing the axe. After speaking with Rob for 10 mins, I was at ease and went ahead and ordered. He made it clear that if I didn't like the axe when I received it, money back no questions. The guitar had to be ordered in from o/s and Rob kept me fully updated with the ETA....calling me and e-mailing me several times during the course. The axe arrived when he said it would :) , and now that I have it in my hands, all I can say is WOW. It is everything he said it was, does everything he said it could and just sounds delicious!. Interstaters, do not hesitate to purchase from this cat!!! Seldom have I experienced this exceptional level of customer service and care from anyone in the guitar/music industry. It's clear to me that Rob is truly passionate about his trade. ***** Highly Recommended ***** PS: I'm yet to find anywhere else in Aus with as good pricing, either!]
