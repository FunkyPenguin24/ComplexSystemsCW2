[108316138804441776804,100547299768039556272,I'm new to El Paso, and when my car started to need work, we asked around. We were told "just take it to the dealer" by a bunch of people. So I took it to the Ford dealership nearest me...which happens to be this dealership. I regret it ever since. They charge a $90 diagnostic fee if you decide not to get the repair done. That's PER ISSUE. So if you have them look at two issues, get one fixed, and wait on the other, you'll still get charged the $90 for the issue you didn't get done. On top of that, their prices are astronomically high. To top that off, they charged me $200 to fix an electrical issue. I got it home to realize it's not fixed. I called them, they asked me to bring it in again. It's almost a week later, and I still don't have a car. I don't know what's going on with it either. I've called numerous times and my "service advisor" won't return my calls. I'm never going back to them, and you shouldn't either. You're going to just get ripped off and treated poorly.]
