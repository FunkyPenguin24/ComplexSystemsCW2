[112187324386856777289,100809401766596914951,I go here on a regular basis. The staff is very friendly, we are even on a first name basis. I think that is very unusual in this day and age.The food is great and served up fresh each and every time. I especially like their homemade breakfasts, pizza and Latino food such as their burritos. I highly recommend Pizza Movers on Flower Ave.]
