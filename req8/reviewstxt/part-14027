I was disappointed by the tea selection (smaller than expected) and the manner of servive (styrofoam cups). I was hoping for a chill teahouse with ceramic dishes and a more relaxed atmosphere. Charleston Tea Company is more of a coffee-shop style place that happens to serve tea. It's location across from the vistors center means there is a lot of traffic inside and out, giving the place a rushed feel. Again, good quality, but not what I expected.]
