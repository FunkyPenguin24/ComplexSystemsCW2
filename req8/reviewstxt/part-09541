[106641185537003823796,100668033592647540110,Brought in a Pontiac G6 covered in road salt and crud for a wash, charged $15 for the deluxe wash, which is probably the best way to go. The staff direct you to guide your car in position, then spray down and scrub bugs and heavy grime on the front end. The tunnel covers everything from a prewash to a teflon postwash (not sure exactly what effect it had, still going to wax the thing afterwards) but the final results were well worth the fifteen dollars. Pulled out afterwards to vacuum the interior and the vacs are quarter driven- kind of a letdown for a credit/debit world. Staff guiding the car when getting into tracks were efficient, though a little overcommanding. Overall, I'd go back with quarters to vac the interior, but the deluxe wash is well worth fifteen bucks.]
