[116372905395657379385,100666974329915780798,We had a great experience. It was raining, but that was no problem because it's covered. Staff was very helpful in identifying the gems. Kids, ages 6 & 9, had fun finding their shiny treasures. We got 2 kids souvenir buckets, an amethyst and citrine bucket, and a super bucket. "In my souvenir bucket I found amethyst, ruby, citrine, rose quarts, and some others." -age 9]
