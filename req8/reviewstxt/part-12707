[112913414474443895580,100840399093565343681,My girlfriends and I rented The Cabin for the Christmas weekend last year. The Cabin is situated right next to a beautiful creek, and it had a hot tube (a requirement for a girl's weekend!). We had a great time hiking the trails around the cabin (it was a mild winter), stilling around a campfire and celebrating the holiday in true country fashion! All in all it was peaceful and relaxing and a great opportunity for us girls, who live in separate states, to re-connect and make some great new memories!]
