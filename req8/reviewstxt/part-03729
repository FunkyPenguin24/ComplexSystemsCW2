[117499556074265743671,100354799380015257001,Service department completely dropped the ball on the "We Owe" items I purchased with my vehicle. Had to call weeks later to inquire to find out that they had yet to order the parts. Was rear-ended 2 weeks after purchasing my car and naturally took it to the dealer to get the best possible parts from the people who work on my type of car regularly. They returned my car to me with more than 350 miles more on the odometer than there where when I dropped it off, and with no gas left in the tank though I dropped it with about half. Also received the car with a broken plastic casing on my steering wheel when the interior was still like new when I dropped it off. Overall, very unhappy with my experience with Gillman Subaru. I can't believe a dealership would operate with this degree of neglect and contempt for its customers.]
