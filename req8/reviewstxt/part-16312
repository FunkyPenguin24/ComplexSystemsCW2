[105993306390698654308,101037026549411351560,Probably won't go back. Service was incredibly poor. Waitress forgot appetizer and then plopped it down when we were half way through our meal. She took our order and placed 2 dirty dishes of food on our table when she took it. A different waitress deemed it necessary to get on her knees at each booth to take an order. Food was ok but the waitresses have absolutely NO training and apparently no common sense.]
