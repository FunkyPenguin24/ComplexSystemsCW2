[105595062628665850335,100210262478281755089,I work right by Grimaldi's of Garden City and love going there for lunch! Their pizzas are the perfect size for a great meal and are deliciously crispy. The sauce is amazing and they have the perfect amount of cheese. Everything that I've tried on the menu has been delicious. Even though I work down the block, I would travel from afar to eat at Grimaldi's. The service is great too!]
