[108649587390135995135,101126369196232510211,I'm 30 and found myself needing chiropractic care for the first time and gave Total Spine Health and Injury Center a try since Brent had stopped into my work and introduced himself and welcomed any of us to come give him a try. My only regret is not going there sooner. I put up with moderate back pain for a lot longer than I should have and could not be happier with the care I have been/am/will be receiving at TSHIC. The staff is kind and friendly and Brent is a miracle worker. Can't wait for my next appointment.]
