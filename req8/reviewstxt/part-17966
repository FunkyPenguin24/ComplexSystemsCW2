[103027370984697933861,101127300460239583257,The Perfect Day Out with family or friends. If you love taking walks. If you love live performance. If you love fun comfort food. If you love a good beer, wine or mead. All in the company of fellow visitors having fun, DO NOT MISS this festival. There are rides and shows for kids that adults will love. Most of the shows are kid friendly with enough "inside" jokes to make it fun for all. There are also some "adult" humor acts (that are carefully noted) that will have adults roaring with laughter. Since the last time I went they added microphones to the larger performances and the joust so that you can clearly hear. There is a lot of shade but be prepared for sitting in the sun at times. Do NOT miss Don Juan and Miguel! The food and beverages are a bit pricey. Overall this is a FUN day. Check it out online to plan your day.]
