[110322361739525509995,100356345385747071377,I have nothing but great things to say about J Kent Staffing. I had just moved back from Hawaii, and was ready to get out of retail. I found J Kent staffing on another site and decided I'd give them a try. Karen was absolutely amazing. They got me a job interview with a company in less than a week, and I have been with that company for over a year now. J Kent made sure I was placed with a good company, with people that I like. Karen's follow up to make sure everything was going good continues to this day. Great support, and a great company over all. I highly recommend J Kent Staffing to anyone looking for a job!]
