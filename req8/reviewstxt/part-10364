[104778836181204633621,100713146667355998246,I have been a client here for years. I love the location, very easy to reach and park. The staff are all very nice and attentive. Its a treat to have nice cup of flavored coffee or drink during your service. I have referred many people over the years and all have had positive experiences. Both Mason and Erin are very skilled and well trained hair stylist. I also love the wide range of products they offer! I wouldn't go anywhere else. Try it, you'll love it too!]
