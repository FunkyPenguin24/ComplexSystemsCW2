[109125089561632850353,100055155113509573287,I was so sad to see all the negative reviews from a handful of frustrated people. I write as a non-pregnant woman not attempting to get pregnant, only visiting for standard annuals. But both doctors I've had have been very sweet ladies, and (unlike at my last gyn) no one tries to push blood work on you if there's nothing wrong. Only need to have a pap done once every 3rd annual. I've never had any of the weird over-billing issues people have complained about---I had $0 copay when I was on my parents' insurance and $0 copay now on my own insurance. And to top it all off, they gave me a frosted sugar cookie. There's a reason they're such a large practice- they know what they're doing.]
