[105446918846454977501,100657956892638789461,Despite what everyone says I find this gym to be filled with nice people. Yes, at times it can get crowded but it's usually pretty mellow. I have been coming here since it first opened in February '13. They clean pretty regularly and they have stations where you can get freshwater and hand sanitizer. Locker room for women is pretty clean the only part I find is gross is their showers. Yuck! But they are nice. I don't see why people think it's got rude people or dirty machines.. perhaps they just haven't checked out the other nasty gyms that I've gone to such as 24 hour fitness and LA fitness.]
