[106375025859150305218,100976326478054396247,My family and I went to Ed Voyles Honda to see what was available in the 2013 Fit. Greg greeted us out side and took us right over to the Fits and explained some of the features. He asked me about any specifics I was looking for and I told him I was looking for a particular color, the Blue Raspberry. There weren't any on the lot so Greg went to check the inventory and found that they were expecting the exact car I wanted on their next truck. So we test drove one that was on the lot and Greg got me set up with the paper work for the car that was on its way. It was expected to arrive in a few days. The buying experience was easy and pleasent. No hoops to jump through. I would definitely recommend this dealership to my friends.]
