[102000013533485716483,100824465435830060205,I had a similarly bad experience. I got an estimate for a spring tune up on my lawn mower. I was told that if they ran into any additional expenses above the $35.00 quoted for a tune up, that they would call me for authorization. They took twice as long to service the mower than stated and when I went to pick up the machine the cost was $82.00!! When asked for what the additional expense was for they said it was for replacing the fuel filter and new spark plug. When asked why I was not contacted to be told about the additional expense the office crew became verbally abusive and said that since I did not pre-pay for an estimate they were not obligated to call me. I am not sure what they actually did, but they are difficult to work with and in my estimate completely unprofessional in their dealings.]
