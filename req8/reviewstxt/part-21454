[100198542220884905547,100137390547298486898,I really like this place, and have been going here for lunch a fair bit - until this week. I could be missing something, but they've been closed the whole week, without a sign on the door or any indication of what's going on via their Twitter account or on Facebook. The sandwiches are some of the best I've ever had. Portion sizes are reasonable. It's on the expensive side, but I think it's totally worth it if you appreciate well crafted organic and locally sourced food. They present the wares really well too, which I appreciate. The only criticism I have is that the wait time can be a borderline turn off. Bowich is smack dab in the middle of the downtown lunch market, and a 25 minute wait can be difficult to work on a government lunch.]
