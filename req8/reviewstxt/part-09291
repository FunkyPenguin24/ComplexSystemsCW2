[101208349161382083476,100654875762889948243,Which time? I've enjoyed it every time i have visited the bakery. It's like "Winfield is alive with the taste of vanilla sugar", I recommend for every one to visit Vanilla Sugar @ least once and decide for yourself, try the peanut butter sandwich cookie, or the peanut butter filled cupcake, those are my favorite, and u can't leave behind the macrons, they are the ones made out of meringue, "Oh my god i am getting full just by talking about it". Anyway you would have to try to believe. OH, I almost forgot the most important thing, Ya see what sweets do to you! LOL, the people are the best, they always make sure you leave vanilla sugar happy.
