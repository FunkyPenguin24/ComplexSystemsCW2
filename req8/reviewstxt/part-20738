[115482991265511910539,100098782047053648232,I really like the straight truth being preached here so far, we have been attending regulatly for about 3 months and is good to find a good-doctrine based church now days, where the warning about the dangers of present times are mentioned and not an easy feel-good, non-offensive void prosperity message. They are proactive in helping the needy and benevolence but above all we need to have a strong message about that people don't have to go hell, that God's option is available while we are here and that repentance is needed. Great job, we need to hear the truth with love and that's what we hear here.]
