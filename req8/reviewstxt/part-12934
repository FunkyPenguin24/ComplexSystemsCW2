[101982570419847836426,100853525042755813604,I had read about the battery issue, so I wasn't too surprised to see it popup as an action item for my new vehicle. (Not sure why it wasn't done before sale; guess there isn't much incentive to check vehicles on the lots.) Brought it in for the appointed service and picked up the loaner. Nice way to check out other models, by the way. My Service Rep handled this well and I am content with the recall repair. Thanks for making this as smooth a process as possible.]
