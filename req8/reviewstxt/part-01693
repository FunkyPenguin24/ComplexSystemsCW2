[113367808269571712047,100247297510573064639,I had been wearing contacts for 20 years, and had never really thought of them as a nuisance. Had my contacts not started causing me pain about a year ago, I might never had opted for LASIK. But now, I'm wishing that I had made this decision years ago! I had my surgery two and a half weeks ago. Throughout both my pre-op appointments, the entire staff was prompt, courteous, and answered all of my questions thoroughly, including regarding payment options and post-op care. I especially enjoyed working with Dr. Weigel. She made me feel very assured of my upcoming procedure. On the day of my surgery, the staff did a great job of making me feel relaxed and comfortable. Dr. Holzman performed my procedure, and he walked me through the process as it was happening. My expectations were managed exceptionally well -- everything from what the procedure would feel like to my level of discomfort afterwards to how quickly I would see vision improvement. I had a complex eye health history at best, including a prolonged bout of iritis in my 20's and astigmatism in one eye. The level of discomfort I felt after LASIK was barely even noticeable compared to the discomfort my contacts had been causing me. Plus, at my one day post-op appointment, I was already seeing 20/15 -- better than I was seeing with my contacts or glasses before! Aside from dry eyes, which is common with this procedure, the cornea flaps healed beautifully. I can't thank Dr. Holzman, Dr. Weigel and the entire Tyson's TLC staff enough. I feel like I have a new lease on life now.]
