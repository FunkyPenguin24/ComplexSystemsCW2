We initially decided to check out the Y because of the child care. Not many gyms in Hampton Roads have child care included in the membership. That said, the staff in the Stay and Play area are amazing. The facility for the children is so great. Even while my wife and I are working out, I know that they are taken care of and even have acitivities that get them moving. It's not a simply babysitting service. It's an exceptional program that embodies the Spirit, Mind, and Body approach. As for my wife and I, we have a blast! This facility has a Cardio Theatre that we frequent. It's just that. A room full of cardio equipment situated so that everyone is in view of the big screen playing movies all day long. FITQUEST. If you have never been trained on how to effectively use a gym, or had a personal trainer, that's what you get with this. Everyday we go in, we have a new workout ready to go. What's best is that it is tailored to each individual. No one size fits all workouts here. The Staff. They are simply great people. They actually care about the health and welness of the patrons. Not just the money that is flowing in every month. Programs. There are more programs that I have time for. They truly have something for everyone. The swimming classes(extra cost) are great. For my now 4 year old, we have been incredibly pleased. The patience and ability to teach these young swimmers is incredible. If you are looking for a place to work out, check out the Y, especially the Mt. Trashmore Y.]
