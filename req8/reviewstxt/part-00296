[113066177709697476459,100174894148897002082,I could not believe when I ordered a Lemon Drop Martini with my dinner, salt instead of sugar was put around the glass rim. Although I should have i did not say anything I ordered a second one and was again brought one with salt around the rim,I had taken my nephew out to dinner, He wanted Mexican food. Along with the bad drinks he said his rice tasted as if it had soy sauce on it. The waitress explained the sugar and salt bowls had been mixed up..... I was disappointed with the whole experience and would not recocmmend it to anyone,]
