[111907382359286146061,100770423268694375783,DWR (Breshkie Gardizi) is absolutely an amazing organization. The love and care they show towards these amazing dogs is unbelievable! I have now adopted two dogs from DWR. My first was Nikki who is an absolute amazing Catahoula mix. She is an alpha female and fit into my home with my older Brittany Spaniel and cat perfectly. When I lost my Brittany to old age last year, I waited a while before deciding to adopt a playmate for Nikki. When I was ready, I contacted DWR with my long list of criteria for a new dog. With them knowing Nikki, they knew what to look for in a match for both Nikki and myself. They had been out to my home and knew what kind of life a new pup would have. After a few days, they emailed me to let me know they had found the girl for us. Ida (Valentine her rescue name) came to us on foster to perm basis. She is a doll and I can't imagine my life without her. DWR also matched my boss with the perfect dog for his family. They are also so happy with their dog. My boss often talks about how wonderful DWR is to save these wonderful dogs and all that they go through to do so. I would highly recommend adopting from DWR. Remember the $350 is a minute amount compared to what they spend to get them out of these kill shelters and off the streets. Thank you DWR and all their incredible volunteers!!!]
