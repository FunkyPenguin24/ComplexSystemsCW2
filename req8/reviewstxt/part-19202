[105531925360679382609,100016288660115718542,Overall, the course was pretty awful tee to green from a fairway quality standpoint but that didn't matter at all. This course is for family fun and once on the greens they are in perfect shape. Kids had a blast and that's all that I care about. The pro shop was great and the driving range was perfect and I'm adding it to my list of weekend must dos.]
