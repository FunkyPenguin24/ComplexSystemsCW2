[103183341477493828670,100000823094106656153,Sushi Thai is my absolute favorite sushi place in the Middle Georgia area! My favorite rolls are the Bruce Lee, the Caterpillar, and the Summer Roll. The service is always exceptional and I always enjoy going there. They also have good appetizers as well like the crab angels and the spring rolls. I've never tried the Thai food, but my friends seem to love it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!]
