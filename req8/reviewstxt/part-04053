[104548052099086362163,100372321487971264978,I met Kevin at Costco...he was very helpful and answered all of my questions and concerns. Then Daniel came to our home to assess our heating / ac needs. He is a true pro! Daniel also addressed every aspect of my decision. To my further delight, the installation team(Mike & Victor) came as scheduled! They too did an excellent & very timely job. Hats off to Cool Air!!! Scott in Sandy Springs]
