[114533435528382910702,100289886918936073858,I had a blown fuse -- I knew it because I replaced the fuse myself, and things worked -- until it blew again. They quoted me a price to track down the short, then proceeded to just replace the fuse without doing the work they'd agree to. Naturally, the fuse blew before I'd even left the parking lot. They insisted on still charging me for the work -- a reduced rate, but still, this was a job I could -- and had -- done myself for a buck. I explained all this to them, but still wasn't able to get my car out of the shop without paying them for their "work." I would not trust them as far as I could throw them. Only take your car to them if you have a lot of money and don't mind parting ways with it needlessly.]
