[112353741997838055676,100407470685880412309,I dont know what they are talking about when they say teachers are bad. I currently go to RidgeView and im a Seventh Grader. Its Actually a really good school. The teachers actually go out of their way to help you. At this school if you fail a grade and have to repeat it then most likey its you not doing what you need to do. The teachers have tourtials for students to go to for extra help. As a student I really recomend this school.]
