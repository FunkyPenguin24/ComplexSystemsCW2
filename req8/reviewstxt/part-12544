[117934360547409601074,100830800705733172446,I acutally enjoy coming to this dentist office! The assistant & front desk are so friendly & always so concerned with my needs & well being. I had major sensitivity to sweets & a previous doctor told me that I just needed to use sensodyne toothpaste. I'm so happy I came & received a second look from Dr. Lousignont because I ended up needing a root canal! The crown they put on matches perfectly & you can't even tell it's fake. I'd HIGHLY recommend this office/company to any one looking for general or cosmetic dentistry.]
