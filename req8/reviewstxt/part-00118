[112134544761293767381,100164849904582409894,Very disatisfied!!! I was a regular customer on a maintenance program. Fire ants were discovered in my 10 month old daughters nursery - on the carpet , in the bathtub, and on her toys. They appeared to be nesting in the walls and this was not long after I had the home exterminated. One of the ants had bitten her on the leg. I called at 8:00 am monday morning and was told they could not get to my home until wednesday evening. I told them it was an emergency but was lectured by their customer service agent about the 48 hour policy. I ended up calling another pest control service- Mike Nelson exterminating who came out the next morning. They found 25 fire ant mounds around my home- even though the bulwark had been out less than a month ago. He took care of the problem right away. Bulwark did not take care of me and my family and I would never use them again.]
