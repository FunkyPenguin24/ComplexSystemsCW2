Also, they actually serve beef lasagne with a pretty authentic bologna style sauce! I am sick and tired of 99% of the places that offer lasagne in Islamabad serving the chicken variant only. Everything is prices quite fairly too. And there's a charging-station-cum-work-desk where any patron can sit and work. I sit here for hours at times, working and enjoying my coffee and snacks.]
