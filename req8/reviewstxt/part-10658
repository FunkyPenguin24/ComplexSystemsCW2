[101771882592852779759,100729612501784004527,My wife and I went into Hoigaard's for the first time to see if we could set her up with a downhill ski set for a deal. I jumped the gun and ordered mine online (remember this for later). We were able to get her a pair of skis, boots, poles and helmets for both of us all for 25% off. Gary Ball in the ski dept helped us out and didn't even give me crap for getting mine online. He was super knowledgeble and didn't push us towards higher end skis we didn't need. She loves her ski's! Onto myself. I brought in my skis and boots and bindings to get mounted when they arrived via UPS. I asked Gary about the boot size I ordered and he promised me they were a size and a half too big. As a bummer as it was, I trusted his opinion. Unfortunately all shops around town were out of that boot in my size. They offered to call the manufacturer and another store in Milwaukee for me to find them. (Even though I still hadn't purchased anything from them). They ended up finding them and shipped them next day air. Overall I was blown away by the prices, the knowledge of the staff, and the amazing customer service even to a person who didn't originally give them my business. I'm heading there tonight to pick up my completed skis. Hoigaard's has made me a lifetime customer!]
