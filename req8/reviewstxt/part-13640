[107264354057828075487,100892790236244016711,Stayed there for two days during the Oceanology International 2014. First impression seemed good enough although there was dirt and trash under the couch but the bathroom and bed was clean. However in the bathroom they only had this squeezable soap at both the sink and in the shower. So no shampoo or body wash or any other types of lotion. So a very basic set up. I also tried having the aircondition running over the night but the noise from the AC was so loud that I had to turn it off. This just revealed some other generator/engine that kept me awake for most of the night. In the morning the included breakfast was so sad I just ended up eating cereal. The hot section consisted of poorly looking eggs, sad sausages and no bacon amongst other things. A proper disappointment and especially considering it costed Â£200 per night.]
