[114033720103534443857,100195140673172493250,YUM!!!!!!!!!!!! I've never eaten in, just delivery, but this food is delish! Delivery is fast (even in a polar vortex) and stayed relatively hot. Pizza was good, but the pizza turnover was AWESOME!! Chef salad should be called "meat lovers" and the Italian salad is huge and very, very good. My kids love the chicken strips and appetizers. Can't wait to go in for a visit.]
