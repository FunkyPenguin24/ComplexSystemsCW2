[107398525636106456174,100424385121396460227,I don't love going to the dentist, but I love that clean feeling after I leave. The office was great and they fit me in. They accepted my dental insurance and the hygienist told me about a few areas that might be problems if I don't pay attention to them. The office looks really clean and new and I will update this when I go back.]
