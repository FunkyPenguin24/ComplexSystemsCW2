[108677888403469756923,100177047075365550340,Jim Bowman was the sales consultant I worked with and definitely the best one ever in my 40 years of purchasing vehicles. He was professional and extremely helpful in answering questions and getting the right product for me. He is a great listener and steered me directly to vehicles that were best based upon what I had communicated as my goals and objectives. Jim is extremely knowledgeable about the products which was very helpful in changing my decision to purchase a new, rather than used, Tacoma 4x4 pickup. Jim did a great job of explaining the process and introducing the entire Checkered Flag Team who were a part of the transaction, including those assisting in the service department. He made me feel like I was a part of the Checkered Flag family and both my wife and I can say that this was by far the best experience we have ever had at a dealership! I have already referred three people to Jim Bowman and will continue to do so. He is definitely the go to guy in this area for new or used vehicles and the Checkered Flag experience is definitely the very best!]
