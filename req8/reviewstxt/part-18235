[102935017935964297674,101142372944136981844,The food's always fresh and the service is pretty good - they bring the food out to you and it doesn't take too long. I don't understand previous complaints about space. It's quite spacious unless you were expecting couches and a coffehouse-style place...which it isn't. It's an eatery. I always feel like I made a good choice eating here, and definitely recommend it for a lunch stop. Or a quick snack :)]
