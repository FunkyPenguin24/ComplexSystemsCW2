[110853551279767709348,100629076440545096766,Groupon Deal so was obviously a good price! But a really nice cosy, friendly old fashioned country Inn. Clean & Warm, with exceptionally friendly staff, Dog friendly and nice location. Evening meals very nice. Just a 2 night break in January but good value.]
