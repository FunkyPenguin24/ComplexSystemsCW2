[103893385388351530468,100170029911489172069,I had a specially good experience in shopping for a used car at Peak Kia, Littleton. From my first visit this morning until we closed the deal this evening, I felt that John Morgan was looking after every need that my wife and I verbalized. He took special interest in making sure we had water, that we understood every piece of paper we signed and every option we had. He was extremely patient, allowing my wife to drive all the way home to pick up a document that we had forgotten to bring. By the end of the day, we felt he was our best friend, even though we had just met him. We gave him and his boss, Mike, a number and they responded with a fantastic deal for us. We left feeling that we could recommend our friends to this dealership, in general, and John Morgan, specifically. We are grateful and happy for this whole experience, especially since we have had a history of very negative experiences in shopping for vehicles at other dealerships.]
