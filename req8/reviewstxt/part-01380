[117179036158093453473,100230220555241360263,Our house was built on clay about 20 years ago, and water pressure against the basement foundation was always a problem. Finally, after enough water was seeping in at various spots, we realized that major changes had to be made. I consulted some co-workers, one of whom recommended EverDry, and we have been very pleased with the results. The individual who visited our home to assess our needs was very knowledgeable and took ample time, almost two hours, to discuss the sources of our problems as well as possible remedies. We appreciated his thoroughness as well as the fact he did not try to pressure us into making a decision on the spot. While having this work done on our home was not inexpensive, we recognized the need to address the problem of water seeping into our basement and decided that the purchase would be well worth it in terms of helping our home maintain its value. Simply put, we wanted the job done right. We couldn't have made a better decision. The system installed by Everdry does its job in terms of eliminating external water pressure, which is the root source of seepage. Our basement floor is absolutely dry, and, because we also purchased the EZBreathe system, the basement air is also much less humid. It's reassuring to know we can once again use our basement for storage and not worry about mold and mildew buildup on our belongings. Having Everdry fix our problem was a great decision, and I give the company my highest recommendation, both for quality of work and for service.]
