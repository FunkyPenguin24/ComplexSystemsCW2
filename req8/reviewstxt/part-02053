[117328433779524308481,100265063484926594619,I used Apollo Plumbing several times over the years and Dan Barger has become my trusted professional for my plumbing needs. I used him to install a new water heater in my office and once to fix a small leak I had due to freezing in my barn. The real test however was this last year and the entire reason I signed up for AL. Superbowl Sunday morning my neighbor and I (who share a well) wake up to no water. We check up by the pump house and for some reason it is broken and leaking all over. It is superbowl Sunday for crying out loud!!!! I called Dan knowing there was no way that he would be able or willing to come out. He was there within about an hour, spent hours in the mud chasing down the leak and fixed it. He definately missed the game and I did not. I have referred him to several friends and family members who also have had good experiences.]
