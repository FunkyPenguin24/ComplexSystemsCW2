[104195353029418347749,100229100534619181285,Grandma and I were trying to find just the right car for my daughter, and we looked all over the state for a Verano with all the bells and whistles. Well Liberty Buick had the best choices and the perfect car for my daughter, then they worked to make sure the price was right and we were happy. Thanks Kevin! You did a great job! We will always buy from you!]
