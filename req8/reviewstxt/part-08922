[109153659742873171674,100634235116654024739,One word - ORDINARY!! This was my first Aria experience and I was so looking forward to it but what a disappointment. Once seated, we were given menu's. About 20 minutes later, we were served some sort of luke warm soup compliments from the chef. This "treat" was plonked on top of our menu's (that's right - no-one had taken our order) with no explanation of what it was. I had to ask. About 10-15 minutes later a waiter took our order. I had Stradbroke Island oysters as an entree - 12 of them at $4 each and they were swamped in what tasted like vinegar. It was impossible to taste the flavour of the oyster. I had the pork as a main and was presented with 4 pieces of something on a plate. I have no idea whether all four were pork or two were something else. It tasted ok but again the flavours of the basic ingredients were very hard to detect. I shared a cheese platter with my husband to finish and this was lovely. The best part of the evening apart from the company at our table was the 3 bottles of Pol Roger 1999 Winston Churchill champagne. Maybe Matt Moran needs to spend some time back in the kitchen rather than promoting himself on TV.]
