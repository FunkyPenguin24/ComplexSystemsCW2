[103528094627409626986,100709762497260955114,Okay, don't get me wrong. Blue Flame has some great talent.However, I don't think their business practices are ethical. A couple of years ago, I bought $300 worth of gift certificates for my fiance who was getting a sleeve done by one of their artists. (Keep in mind the gift certificates have NO expiration date on them.) He just happened to be one of their most popular artists, so making an appointment was almost impossible. And just our luck, he has his own shop now and is no longer at Blue Flame. Blue Flame told me they would not honor the gift certificates now because they were more than a year old. I was NEVER told there was a deadline on these and there is no written expiration date anywhere. They have $300 of my money for services NEVER rendered.]
