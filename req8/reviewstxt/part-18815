[103470732908477475147,101173509246482161842,I had not been here since I was a kid. I was pleasantly surprised to have dinner here today and found that it was still a good place to eat. Many pancake-style restaurants in my area have simply gone down-hill over the years. Though the decor may not have seen an update in a while, the staff was wonderful and the food was tasty. The portions are easily enough for two people and the menu is HUGE. They serve breakfast (all day), lunch and dinner, anything from American, Greek, to Mexican inspired foods. Not many healthy options/alternatives, but its a great place for good standard meals.]
