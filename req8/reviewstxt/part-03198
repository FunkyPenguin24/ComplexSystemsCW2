[110358616645592967864,100323505219963682306,I had my boyfriend go to Dunkin Donuts to pick up some donuts on 06/01/2012 at 9:15pm. He then informed me via text that they were out of Donuts. How can a place that mainly serves Donuts be OUT!! The employee informed my boyfriend that it was national Donut Day. Ok thats fine but maybe better preperation would haved been nice. I am very disappointed in this. Hopefully next year they can be better prepared.]
