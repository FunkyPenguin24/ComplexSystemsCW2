[108992256627617837703,100971700509941149765,Prime Autos has now moved to Marooka. They have the worst customer service, my car was with them for over a month and not once did they contact us, we had to chase them everytime and always got the 'I dont know anything' response from the salesmen. Finally they said we could pick the car up. Got there and it wouldnt go into gear. The gear linkage had fallen off. I told them to keep it and fix it but this time you can bring it to me and was told that it depends on staff availability. Worst customer service I have ever seen and going by the car I bought off them I would not trust them with any purchase.]
