[101208978291953378953,101114010793541180873,I recently took my 10 month old son here for Easter pictures. Cora was absolutely amazing and did everything to get a smile out of my son. He smiled every time she walked into the room and the array of props / backdrops / themes she has to work with are great!! Her portrait packages are flexible and there are tons of options! She's quick, but not pushy, she just knows what she's doing and how to do it! All in all I highly recommend!]
