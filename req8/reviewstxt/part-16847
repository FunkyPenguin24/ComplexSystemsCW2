[110237049283564377161,101065798317866694766,Arrived 20 min before checkin time and was told our room was not ready and would have to wait. While waiting observed 3 other patrons arrive and recieve there keys and go to there rooms? Now why did we have to wait??? Why didnt we get that room and they wait we were there first. Preassigned rooms would be my guess. Not good bad service.]
