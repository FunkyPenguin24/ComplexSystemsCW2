[116120710193104070269,101152946770600856001,Dr. Ned was fantastic in a number of ways. He worked well with my insurance, he did a thorough diagnosis (including x-rays, movement analysis, and more) to determine what all was going on, and he used a variety of methods to treat my back and neck problems. I left his office feeling lighter and lighter every time. When I started, I was in so much pain I couldn't hold my baby or go grocery shopping for more than 5 minutes. In just a few months of visits he had me back up on my feet and back to my old fitness activities as well as playing with my kids and everything. I was very impressed with how professional, polite, and friendly he was while helping me work through all my pain. I would recommend his work to anyone!]
