[107656727369477324350,100719211127559073752,I'm responding to the last review before me- I think this person might have had a bad experience or someone having a bad day?? My husband(MILITARY) and I first went into the garden place after calling around looking for some mulch,manure,natural matter. We called first to ask questions which KARIN the owner spent about 10 minutes just giving us suggestions! when we went there we had to wait a few for one on one assistance on a busy sat. then karin personally spent 30 minutes with us.she knew a lot about all kinds of gardening issues and we spent $50. Not a lot considering the personal time spent with us. try getting 30m out of an employee at lowe's,home depot!! and u spend at least that $. she employs a few people and they are frequently busy so I try stop in early to get more personal time. its a small business that I have seen many times giving personal service to its large amount of customers. yes prices are bit higher than the big stores but worth it just for the service. never once have I heard any negativity towards military, I'm in there at least twice a month because I make an all natural body,bath care line and karin asked me(on my first visit) to bring some my items in to sell there, without wanting anything in return. I now give her 20% to be fair(electricity is not free). I buy some of my herbs and plants for my natural line from her. I am a stay at home military wife and mom of 4 have lived in clarksville area for 7 yrs now. I've shopped at all the nurseries and big home stores and overall Garden place is a good small business. Everyone has a bad day from time to time so maybe that last reviewer didnt get the normal service I have seen there so often. Everyone deserves a second chance!]
