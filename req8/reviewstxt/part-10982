[111778455217382692229,100746780269920132281,Our shared building washing machine broke down, so I had to find a coin-op place in the neighborhood fast. I saw that a lot of people had left good reviews about The Laundry Room on Google, so I read them, and that sealed the deal. It's exactly as everyone describes. Kari is awesome, super helpful, and everything is clean, well maintained, and fairly priced. This is the place to go!]
