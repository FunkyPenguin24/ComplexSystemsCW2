[109284066564434683453,100403195986263456438,I called at 8:35am on wednesday the 11th of december 2013 to make an appointment.The receptionist says you are good with Doctor Aaron 3:45pm today. I show up for my appointment at 3:30pm only to find the clinic CLOSED with a sign that said, "We are closed early today for a Christmas Party. Go to the insta care which is opened from 7-9" IS THIS A JOKE? at that time of course i couldnt get a different place to give me an appointment that day. i can not believe i was STOOD UP BY LEHI CLINIC STAFF!! this would of been my second time going there. When i called to tell someone the chuckled and said im sorry. I am never recomending this place, very disappointing.]
