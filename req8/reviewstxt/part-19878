[114019636324059648984,100053396050696041268,I've been a member for about 4 months. I joined when they waived the $35 initiation fee so I pay $9.99 per month plus once a year they charge $39.99 (they say this fee ensures you lock in the $9.99/mo. rate - we shall see). Even with the unnecessary extra $40 fee, if you do the math, it's like $13.33/mo. Considering there are at least 15 treadmills, another 15-20 elliptical machines, and at least 8 stationary bikes, I never have to wait for a machine. There are weights too! A large back room full of free weights and weight benches for bench press, et cetera. There is also quite a good selection of universal weight machines. They debit your bank account each month for payment and you cannot sign up without your bank details. Although I didn't really appreciate the additional $40 fee, I have to admit this place has all the machines I like to use and I never have to wait for them. What more can you ask for?]
