[100137562691801266376,100046859212807640215,I believe it's more or less impossible to buy a man's shirt in Northampton for less than $100. Some reviewers here seem to be confused. Thorne's Marketplace isn't Sears or JC Penny where every day is a super sale and you bring coupons. Here's something that's true. I have nice dress shirts I've bought here and other places in Northampton 15 years ago. On one shirt I actually had a tailor reverse the collar and am still wearing it. I generally buy my wife's Christmas presents here because I'm after something really special and nice. If you're after commodity stuff or "hauls" look elsewhere. Thornes is expensive, it's unique, it's expensive, it's exclusive. This means people are excluded. If you're ready to own fewer, nicer things this may be for you.]
