[109361062794467796187,100780100108355936977,From the beginning this was a great place to buy our new Honda. I sent a quote request via Email and in just a few minutes Ken sent me the quote in plain English. No hidden costs or concerns. We looked into their inventory and found the car that we wanted to test drive, I sent it to Ken and made an appointment to meet. Once we got there the car was parked waiting for us. The finance team was great as well, no pushing to buy stuff that we don't need very respectful. This team is like no other, I trust them. My new mini Van is awesome.]
