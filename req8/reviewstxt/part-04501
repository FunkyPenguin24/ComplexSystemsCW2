[102536514715659196935,100398473796977877742,I was a little worried when dealing with Acadia but heard nothing but good personal reviews from neighbors. He removed a skin tumor from my Pit and I have never had any issues. They have great prices and my two dogs and two cats get all their annual vaccines through him. He had been a vet for YEARS and is well-known throughout Tulsa.]
