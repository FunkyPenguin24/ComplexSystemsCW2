[101389815152724835166,100784108036905492850,We stayed at this hotel after a long road trip on the Harley and the staff was outstanding! The hotel is beautiful, rooms are clean, and King bed was very comfortable. The front desk staff suggested we park our bike out front where the staff could keep an eye on it overnight. We were very impressed by the staff and hotel. Would definitely recommend to anyone!]
