[112549398440169149421,100050116858759342273,This was my first eye test in 20 years! I avoid seeing health practitioners as much as I can as I often find them sullen and uninformative and often not particularly of benefit. This was completely different. Susan (?) the optician was extremely competent in what she did but also, what makes the difference is she took time to explain clearly every aspect of what she was doing and why and even when there was need to refer me to a doctor for a particular issue she clearly explained what it was for and what would happen. So often we are told what to do without being told why and treated more like 'widgets' going through a process. Susan treated me kindly and considerately and as an individual and with full information on what would happen with my glasses and my referral to a doctor, and her colleagues were equally as friendly in their approach to customers! Excellent service. Highly recommend them. They also responded to my appointment request 24 hours faster than the nearby Specsavers.]
