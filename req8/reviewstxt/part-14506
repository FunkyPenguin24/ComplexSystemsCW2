[106538190832652924319,100940182274193460796,This Spec's does exist. We go all the time as well. It's in the back strip behind the gas station and the Berry Hill. They have a decent beer select, decent scotch selection, decent everything selection... Ok cigar selection, better than a convenience store by a mile but not as good as the HWY 6 & Bissonnett store and nothing like downtown Spec's, which goes without saying. That said, for a neighborhood liquor store it gets an A++ and the price is good too. Also Whole Foods is awesome. Just understand why you're there, don't go as a tourist. If you're anti-intellectual, anti-science, or just a negative person you won't have a good time. They have some of the best food you can get in a grocery store, a great bulk isle and the meat counter is pure heaven. Fish also, you can get sashimi grade fish... Try and do that at a Randalls or a Kroger and you'll probably wind up in a hospital...]
