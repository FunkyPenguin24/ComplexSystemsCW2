[114328602937453584631,100704382832232290045,We went there on a Friday after work and did not leave until after 10pm even though the salesman was scheduled to get off at 9pm he stayed until all the paperwork was done and made sure we knew all about the new Altima we purchased. This was the first time we ever bought a car from this dealer and we will be back again when the need arises.]
