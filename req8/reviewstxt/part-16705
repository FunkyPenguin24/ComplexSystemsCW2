[110551440293386292774,101058946757097111560,Julie is a true professional wedding photographer. There are a lot of great photographers out there, but there are few with the level of expertise, experience, and dedication. Julie photographed our wedding on October 27, 2012. Julie came prepared, she was early, had scoped out the best spots for portraits, had special equipment with her to get the best lighting, and was accompanied by an intern. Julie has an authoritative presence which is very important for large family portraits when you have to wrangle a lot of people. At the same time she is pleasant and patient and does not come across as either bullying or intrusive (which I have witnessed from other wedding photographers). Julie is definitely undercharging for the level of service she provides and you should book her before her rates go up.]
