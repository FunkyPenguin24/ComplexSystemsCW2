[100877139812867985786,100547120822510537833,I went to see Janet for a prenatal massage. She was excellent and really helped my sore lower back, neck and shoulders. She even showed me stretches that I should be doing during pregnancy and beyond. I booked my next appointment for next month! Would definitely reccomend :)]
