[111607672316177525731,100687826146611931756,I have been getting Doctor Hendlin's chiropractic adjustments and nutritional counseling for my whole life. I am his son, so that made it easy. But I have seen him change so many lives for the better! He has helped people lose weight, heal from all sorts of things from chronic rashes all over their bodies to steady pains in joints, muscles, and other parts of their bodies. He really knows what he's doing and many people ahve told me so. The love and aloha spirit I've witnessed between he and his patients over the years is like nothing I've ever experianced. He is very busy but he also does spend a lot more time with each patient than most chiropractors do. He also knows SO MUCH about the human body and how different vitamins and minerals (or nutrients) are to be used to heal and treat specific things, from ligament and joint damage, to gastro intestinal disorders, to pretty much anything under the sun. He provides health care for your whole body, and sees it as a complete integrated system -- Its Holistic health care for your WHOLE body!-- This I believe is what he does best. P.S.- A great natural alternative to MD's because he provides your body with the natural tools it needs to heal itself the way it was designed to, as opposed to providing toxic drugs with harmful side-effects. Many if not most diseases are caused by neglecting the bodies needs for certain nutrients, and lifestyle habits like movement and exercise. Don't neglect your bodies own ability to heal itself and repair damage! All most people need to do is give their bodies the tools to do its job. Doctor Hendlin is my dad, and I love him, but I still think that everything in my review is true. Aloha, Go get healthy.]
