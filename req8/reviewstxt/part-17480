[111682849416944307692,101102109461295696287,Tim and his employees have done great work on both of our cars, and always at a ridiculously affordable rate. I've been through the shop about 7-8 times now for various issues, and have been happy every time. I've never been treated like an idiot or been pressured into having unnecessary extra work done, which has been my experience at several other shops. And he certainly hasn't gone ahead and done repairs I didn't ask for and billed me for them. Very honest. The repairs speak for themselves, in my experience. I've had alternators die, wheel bearings go out, overheating troubles and awful noises coming out of the motor, yet Tim has fixed everything quickly and affordably. Actually fixed, too. I haven't had to go back to have a low-quality "repair" fixed.Tim himself is great to deal with. Upfront, polite and quick to let you know what you actually need done and how long it will take. Not your typical repair shop vibe, in a great way.]
