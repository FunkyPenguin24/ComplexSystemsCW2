[107819800660098620012,100258287137526769396,I had an apartment complex with tar/gravel that was leaking bad. Black Hills was pretty diligent about studying the situation and helping me think through my options. Ended up going with 80-mil TPO membrane. They did almost 6000 square feet in less than a week, and it's guaranteed for over 20 years. Looks fantastic. Price seemed competitive with others I checked. They could have done a little better job in cleaning up those nasty old through your shoes roofing nails that ended up on the lawn, and maybe guarding against stuff falling into my apartments below, but overall these things were minor in comparison with the job.]
