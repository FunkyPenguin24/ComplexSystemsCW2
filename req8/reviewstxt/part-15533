[108559427288449033918,100995966666531578233,Holy smokes... I should have typed this A LONG TIME AGO! My husband and my 17 year old son are pizza-aholics and they needs help...Since we have discovered 19th Street, My boys will only eat 19th Street pizza as picky as they are about their pizza, 19th Street is always fresh and hot. And my little ones (9, 7 & 4) fight over the crust that is well seasoned ...garlic & Butter Delicious! I'm not a big pizza eater myself but I eat their pizza & their salads are FRESH AND AMAZING....the QUALITY AND QUANTITY IS AWESOME. We literally eat pizza from here once a week ! The owner and his family are friendly and always kind...(Even if I pick up my order a little late sometimes!) We are proud to support this local/family owed and ran restaurant.... And think they're pretty amazing!]
