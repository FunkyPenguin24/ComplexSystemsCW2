The owners gave people a discount for that reason. A great family run business. It is a neat ride down in the elevator and the cave walls are really neat and the views out of the cave were awesome. I took my 10 year old and it is a must-see in that beautiful part of the world. Went to the lighthouse afterwards then Mo's in Florence.]
