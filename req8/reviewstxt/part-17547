[104014708125203586846,101105727978082480770,Good food for such a small town. I'm pretty sure they have the same crawfish sauce that they put on every single meal. If you like that kind of sauce, it is delicious! But they put it literally on every single dish that they have. They're grilled chicken house salad was good.]
