[100867263437118696418,100377259279573441533,I wouldn't trust this place. I think that having the dogs outside leads to an unsanitary disease-ridden enviroment. My dog seemed to hate it, and I don't think that there is enough supervision of the dogs. You're taking a risk, even though this place is cheap. Good luck if they ever remember your dog's name: pretty clear sign of the level of concern.]
