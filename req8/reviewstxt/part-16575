[111118274577729744781,101051610184377170268,Adam Narkiewicz was our salesperson... This is the third vehicle we've purchased from Honda Cars of Bradenton and there's a reason we continue to go back and that's SERVICE! We were lucky enough to work with Adam who was not only helpful with our choice in the purchasing of our new Pilot but also knowledgeable about the car, it's new features and how to use all of them. We never feel pushed into a sale and know we're getting the best price, know they're doing the best for us and we never feel that we're going to be put out by the car payment when we leave. Rodney was great at the closing of the sale, helpful in explaining everything we were paying for and other coverages offer. I highly recommend buying a car from Honda, and if you're as lucky as me....Matt Woods will come by and say hello!! Thanks guys!!]
