[115105281169680705246,100929268399483170792,Magnificient historic hotel. Loved the gardens. Enjoyed my time spent at their delightful bar in the lobby.. drinks were reasonably priced... The hotel seems to well serviced by local taxis..that will take about Rs 150 to Thamel.. or it was just a 10 min walk. Highly recommended. Would stay here if I ever visit Nepal again.]
