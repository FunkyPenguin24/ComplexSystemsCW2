[113989671792521899172,100511891887333509717,My cat gets sick, alot. I do my best to clean up between the furballs but its a losing battle. I dont have the carpet cleaned often enough, but when the cat has left its mark many, many times, I need to call in a pro. Before the cleaning I feel like I need to rip out the old and start over. Once the cleaning is done, MY CARPET LOOKS NEW! Great job!]
