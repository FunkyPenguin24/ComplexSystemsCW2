[107270068101286790301,100490269442325802265,I purchased a 2014 Kia Sorrento. This is the most amazing dealership I have ever experienced! They walked you through every detail of the vehicle, inside and out. They also showed us how to use every feature the vehicle offered. They even walked us through the dealership and explained every detail to us regarding bringing my new vehicle in for service, free car washes, and introduced us to the Service Manager. Every single person we encountered was friendly, helpful, and very upbeat and fun!]
