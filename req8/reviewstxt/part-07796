[116228551663902281496,100576736160290955050,This store does not comply with policies outlined on the official UPS store. I was told that they are a "franchise." Do not waste your time with this store. Even when shipping in your legal rights according to federal regulations, and even when the official UPS website states that you as an individual is in the right > this store's staff will discriminate against you. I will never give them my business. They don't live up to policies stated on the UPS official website. This is quite deceiving for the customer. The staff is quite possibly individually opinionated, uneducated, and in fear of getting fired to the point that they turn customers away, customers that are perfectly in the right. Beware of so-called 'franchise' UPS locations. They have their own rules that do not shadow federal rules for shipping/mailing items that even apply to them.]
