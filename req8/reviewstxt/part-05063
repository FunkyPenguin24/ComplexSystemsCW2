[110479369667360912102,100426871469127712969,Went to Widdoss on the recommendation of a facialist and at a time when I really needed to manage some stress. The hour-long massage was wonderful! He really got the kinks out of some stressed out muscles without the pain that can sometimes accompany that type of work. I thought that I might have to go to a doctor, the strain was so bad. However, since the massage, many of the cricks and kinks have been minimalized. Hope I can go back to him again and soon.]
