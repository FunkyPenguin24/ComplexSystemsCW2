[103947630002853375293,100387201162500825557,Food is decent. If you only speak English you are going to have a major issue. Service is terrible, beyond terrible. I speak Spanish and can't stand it. Prices are good. Recommend a relleno(sweet bread stuffed with ham and cheese) which is one dollar by the way. Relleno and a cappuccino for breakfast in the morning for like two bucks can't beat that.]
