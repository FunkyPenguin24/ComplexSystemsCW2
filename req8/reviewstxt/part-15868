[110200137307421903424,101013983421334088192,Beth did our wedding photography and I was really, REALLY impressed with her work. First, she is stealthy. Seriously, we never felt like we were having a camera awkwardly pushed in our faces and the only posed photos were ones we wanted. She managed to catch candid, unique, beautiful pictures of everyone at our wedding. We've all been overexposed to traditional wedding photography and Beth's style is absolutely refreshing. She captures angles that highlight the natural surroundings without drowning out the subjects, she gets those rare moments when kids light up and are in awe of the world around them and even manages to avoid the ugly cry. I have never felt more beautiful than when Beth captured my image and I actually usually despise pictures of myself. I also must mention that she is fastidiously dedicated to her art. She regularly attends workshops (creativeLIVE anyone?) to stay at the front of her field and it shows. She obviously spends countless hours picking out the cream of the crop photos and meticulously editing them to perfection. And her TALENT. Again, you can't fake that. She's gifted! If you have any reason to even think about working with her--don't hesitate. You'll be blown away!]
