[101710298099535492530,101061563889648117876,As a professional photographer myself, I am very particular about what I like in photography, especially when the images are of me and my husband. The reason I'm *behind* the camera 95% of the time is because I strongly dislike being in front of it! That all said... I couldn't be MORE thrilled with the beautiful photos that Drew and Angela captured of my husband and me during our visit to Denver last September. We had fun, we felt like we could be ourselves, and the results totally blew us away. Our decision to hire Drew and Angela take take our portrait turned out to be such a blessing. We are so thankful to them both for giving us this gift and we can't wait for our next trip to Colorado so we can do it all over again!]
