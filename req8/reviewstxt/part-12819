[100802277688409738603,100847112470057335129,I booked 3 rooms for a vacation week-end with family. Only 2 were ready at check-in time (3PM), so we waited in the one room that was ready. About 1-1/2 hours later, we re-contacted the front desk, and the other rooms were made available. The rooms are very small - really designed for a single person (apparently for a single night given the small number of towels). No pool, and no breakfast to speak of. Hotwire gives it a 3.5 star ranking, but it doesn't stack up to most 3 star places I've stayed amenity-wise. There is free high-speed internet so, if you're traveling on business for a day or two, its probably adequate. However, I wouldn't recommend it for a pleasure trip.]
