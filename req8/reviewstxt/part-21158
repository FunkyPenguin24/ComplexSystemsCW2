[117729358253411163533,100121080577362775060,Danny, is and has always been for my 8 years in Pottstown, provided the best service along with the personality which you will not find at a WaWa or major big wide spread multiple branch mart or mini grosser store. He gives and always has given a welcoming smile and when not too busy, "great conversation". I just wanted to commend him and those who make Brunish's Grocery, " The incredible hometown more then but still reserved to what some call Mom and Pop stores. Thank you Danny and I will be there not long from now for one of your well known Hot Sausages. You make the kids from the school happy with the location of your store. Thanks again Danny.
