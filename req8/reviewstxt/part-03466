[115286964069201470639,100338695895966361096,Me and my wife went in and were treated very rudely. My wife and i are muslim my wife had her hair covered at the time and it seemed to be a problem for them. They began to speak in spanish about us not knowing that my wife is Mexican. It hurts me because i live in the same neighborhood just one block away. I see lots of people go into their business but I rarely see any people of color like myself. Although i know or at least i think the owners are Latino it seems as if they would prefer to have their business filled with the new gentrified look of our neighborhood.]
