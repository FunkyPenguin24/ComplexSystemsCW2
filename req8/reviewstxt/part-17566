[102921845826586625545,101106610081532003450,I enjoy my visits to The Silly Grape and I go there often. They serve fresh food, typically have many friendly servers on-hand, and cater to a professional crowd. Like most other small restaurants they run into some hiccups when they get hit hard during lunch or happy hour, but overall it is a great mom-amd-pop shop. Being surrounded by 6 or 7 large TV screens with ESPN and GolTV is a huge plus.]
