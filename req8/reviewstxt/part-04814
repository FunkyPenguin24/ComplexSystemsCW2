[103516156802530629265,100413907658456264993,HORRIBLE experience, my boyfriend tried to surprise me with roses at work, he ordered them at 9 am thinking they would be delivered in a matter of hours as promised, come time for me to get off and he had to call to tell me to stay at work for a lil longer b/c something was coming...come 2 hours after my clock out time, no show he called, no answer....30 mins later I got a call announcing the flowers were on the way! WAY TO RUIN THE SURPRISE! lady was rude and rushed, and the flowers were NOTHING like what he ordered, huge disappointment]
