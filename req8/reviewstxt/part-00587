[108515551765941088256,100190190355542177599,We saw a show there recently in what were billed (and charged) as good seats. We were so far away the faces of the performers were indistinguishable. Generally the sound quality was good for the music, but not for the dialogue. They get good shows there that I would like to see, but in the future will be very picky about seating.]
