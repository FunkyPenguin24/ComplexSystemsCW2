[103502359905787713875,100020196246484224554,I have been coming into Verbena Salon for some time now and love this place. They have very educated and professional women that work there like Shandra that cuts my hair and I have not had one complaint. I am a guy that is very picky with how my hair is cut and have nothing but great things to say about this place. The price isnt too bad either for a great hair cut and the scalp massages definitely make it worth it. If you are struggling to find a hair stylist you can count on, go to Verbena and you wont be disappointed.]
