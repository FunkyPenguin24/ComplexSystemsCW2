[100803318371970005400,100840406674711548302,I have been to two other body shops here in Yakima and was not satisfied with my experience so I just popped in to get one more estimate on my truck (which is 12 years old by the way). L.P. gave me the best estimate of the other body shops so I decided to try them. I also asked them to buff my entire truck afterwards. I couldn't believe my eyes after I got my vehicle back. I had several of my people at work ask me, "did you get new rims on your truck" and "did you get it painted?" A great body shop and I will also let you know I went back a second time for my wife's car and they did just as well.]
