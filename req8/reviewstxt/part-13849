[112176148744152714335,100902807540313648782,This place is by far the best comedy club in Myrtle Beach! Sidenote: This is literally one of the only reviews that I have ever taken the time to write, on anything!! Thats how good this place is. They have a variety of top comedians from around the country and they also display many of the local comics trying to get to the next level. The location is fantastic, the service is great, and I have pretty much tried everything on the menu at this point and it has all been good. Next time you go in there, ask for Jeff or Larry, the owners, and they would be glad to meet you and make sure that you have a great experience.]
