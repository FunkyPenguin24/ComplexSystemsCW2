[112497248494139394387,100723147992320784520,DO NOT GO TO THIS HOSPITAL UNLESS YOU ARE IN MAJOR AND I MEAN MAJOR PAIN OR IF YOU ARE AN OLD PERSON. I GO IN THERE ABOUT 5 DIFFERENT TIMES FOR EXCRUTIATING BACK PAIN. I TOLD THE DOCTOR THAT I WAS TAKING 800MG IBUPROFEN AND FLEXERIL(LEFTOVER FROM MY RECENT PERIOD) AT HOME AND THAT IT WASN'T EVEN PHASING THE PAIN. WELL, AFTER MAKING ME HURT MORE BY LAYING FLAT ON A HARD TABLE FOR 5 DIFFERENT X-RAYS, THEY SENT ME HOME WITH A PRESCRIPTION FOR 800MG IBUPROFEN AND FLEXERIL. HELLO......IF I WANTED TO TAKE THAT, I WOULD GO BACK HOME AND TAKE IT. I WENT TO ANOTHER HOSPITAL BECAUSE IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT AND THEY TOLD ME I HAD A SEVERELY PULLED MUSCLE IN MY LOWER BACK AND THAT IF I HAD MOVED A CERTAIN WAY, I WOULD TEAR THE MUSCLE. THEY GAVE ME PAIN MEDICINE WHILE I WAS THERE AND GAVE ME A SCRIPT FOR VICODIN AND SOMA'S. NORTHSIDE TOLD ME NOTHING WAS WRONG. I'VE HAD SEVERAL FRIENDS BE TREATED THIS WAY. ONE FRIEND OF MINE WENT TO THIS HOSPITAL FOR A PAINFUL SHOULDER. COME TO FIND OUT, SHE ALMOST TORE HER ROTATOR CUFF. THEY PUT HER IN A SLING, GAVE HER A PRESCRIPTION FOR IBUPROFEN AND SENT HER HOME. UNLESS U ARE IN MAJOR PAIN(A MAJOR ORGAN CAUSING THE PAIN OR AN OLD PERSON IN PAIN), U WILL BE LOOKED AT, SET THERE FOR LIKE 2 HOURS, BE TOLD U ARE FINE AND SENT HOME WITH MEDS THAT U CAN TAKE AT HOME.]
