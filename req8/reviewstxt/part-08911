[101140023637412555970,100633921504650681481,The Jolly Millers is under new management and wow!! what a change: Spanish tapas, great home-made grub, real ales, live entertainment, a fine selection of American bourbons and every Tuesday night is Cheeseday night; bring your own guest cheese! As a villager and real ale enthusiast, I'm biased but its the best thing that's hit Cottenham village in all the years I've lived here. Even the local micro-brewery owner hangs out there so that has to be saying something.]
