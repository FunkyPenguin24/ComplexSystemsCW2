[113299353155767655497,100149364538646616286,Had some delicious Pad Thai this weekend at Cafe International. I was surprised they even had a vegan gluten free option. Friendly staff, I even chatted with the owner a bit, and reasonably priced too. I would definitely recommend Cafe International. In fact I have recommended it to a number of friends.]
