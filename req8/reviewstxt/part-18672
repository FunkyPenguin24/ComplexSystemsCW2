[111777091743434247019,101165251959649126880,Be very careful about using Team One Auto Group - Harrisburg they use a ploy to have people come in for their special $15.99 inspection/emission ($20 out the door) and then they find items to fail you for so they can charge you for additional services at their rate of $80/hr. I even had their manager Dave French tell me that if I am not going to use their parts and rates that they do not want me to come in for inspections. When confronted he told me at first he they would meet any comparable offer and then when I provided one, I was told to "just use them". They failed me for an item which I had verified by independent mechanics that claimed there was no reason to replace the item, let alone fail an inspection for it.]
