[116512554928664406746,100980312018640973567,A friend actually recommended that I visit this clinic because they were very kind and friendly and offered very affordable rates. So, I took my Pomeranian here for her annual check-up. I am so glad I decided to give them a try! Not only did I get her shots for a very affordable price but they also found out she had a worm problem...gross. Never in a million years would I have thought my little sunshine would get worms. The whole process was pretty quick and the wait time was minimal. Thanks!]
