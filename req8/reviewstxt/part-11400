[103452690351880688784,100769135476037346714,The guys at Just Tires are excellent. They turned me on to the ComforTred a number of years ago and I am a fan. It is the only tire I will buy now. I drive a lot and so I bought the tire protection plan, which I recommend if you drive very much. I have had a number of major issues due to pot holes or big nails and have used the plan several times and always been really happy I had it. As well, one time, when a friend of mine was visiting from Germany, he got a big nail in the tire of his rental car. We took it over to the guys at Just Tires and they fixed it for us for free. They certainly didn't have to do that, but they knew we were in a hurry and they just took care of us. I appreciate that my loyalty to them is rewarded in ways like that. I recommend this Just Tires location. I also recommend the Comfortred, great, great ride.]
