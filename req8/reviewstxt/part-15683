[104797549827344591302,101003773515457404153,Before I begin, please look back at the several fake reviews posted by themselves I assume (hence the unrealistic 3.5 stars). OK, so if every single eating spot is packed except the one right on the pier, DO NOT attribute that to luck or timing, there is a reason. Anglins has the perfect spot, yet the first time we went there we waited over 45 minutes for a burger so we left even before we received the food. We thought, OK maybe the word "cafe" is not accurate and this is more of a seat down restaurant, so my wife and I gave it a second chance. Here is where it gets interesting: Receiving a menu: 15 minutes Receiving two glasses of water: 12 minutes (warm water that is) Receiving one chicken sandwich and one chicken fried dish: 1 hour 7 minutes During this time, there was only one other table occupied with an elderly couple. Three groups sat down, never received their drinks and left. Michael the waiter (maybe manager?) was very nice but simply stood there completely oblivious of our long wait or the fact that every other restaurant was completely packed on a Saturday afternoon but Anglins. The food was mediocre and fairly expensive, and the only reason we did not pay to walk on the pier is because we had a receipt from the cafe proving we spent money there. Please stay away from their bathroom. And if anyone at Anglins reads this, Lauderdale by the Sea had an amazing renovation of the area, perhaps you missed the memo but it's not too late to clean up a little bit. Would love to go back just for the amazing view you guys got. But for now, readers you have been warned.]
