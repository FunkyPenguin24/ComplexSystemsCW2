[102751076954182398631,100090867042841543894,If you like crowds and inconvenience then you'll love this place. I could list several reasons for only rating three stars, but I will give just one. After having a beer and a couple glasses of wine while I waited over an hour for a table, I decided to switch to coffee after being seated at one of the restaurants. However, they don't serve coffee. The server explained that I would have to go to the coffee bar downstairs. He explained this is how it is in Italy. You don't go to the same place for dinner, dessert, coffee, etc. I get it, but given the lines and crowd and the wait, it was really annoying to have to leave my friends to go downstairs to buy a coffee. I drank more wine instead.]
