[101971723856865746141,100385303405066630880,Love this place! Great that this mini golf is outside, I appreciate being in the fresh air surrounded by rocks, trees, and flowers while you beat your friends at mini golf. (they have fish in their pond too!) I like to hit a few tokens of baseballs while I'm there. The cages don't have nets, so you can really see how far you can whack a baseball! I would recommend this family-run, family-friendly business to anyone looking for a great place to spend a Saturday, rain or shine!]
