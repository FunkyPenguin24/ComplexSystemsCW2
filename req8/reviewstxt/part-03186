[108721102034496976067,100323254341075194118,Through a referral, I decided to see Dr. Buhrman as a result of recurring long-term pain. After just a few visits with a combination of laser, chiropractics and massage, the pain had subsided and I was pain free. As a result, I referred several friends experiencing chronic pain, and had very positive feedback. Thank you Dr. Buhrman for your professionalism, expertise and a new pain free life!]
