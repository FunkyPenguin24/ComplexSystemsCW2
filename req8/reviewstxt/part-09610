[103916658418464681098,100672286996573357790,Dr. Hirsch has been my family Dr. now for about 5 years. I have zero complaints about him. I have been through my grandfather's death from congestive heart failure about 5 years ago with him, and also my father's prostate cancer. I myself had extremely high cholesterol, (we thought the tests were screwed up it was so high) and through all of these issues, and years he has been very helpful, encouraging life changes for the cholesterol instead of prescriptions, and the drugs were not necessary. I would recommend him to anyone.]
