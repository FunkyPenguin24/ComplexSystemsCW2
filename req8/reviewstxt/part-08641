[104224523344754939551,100620697050290774944,My dad purchased and item for my husband for Christmas. It ended up not fitting but because he bought it online and we didn't have the receipt the customer service lady wasn't even interested in helping him AFTER he stood in line for 30+ minutes. We called to talk to a manager and he pretty much implied that anyone without a receipt is treated as if they stole the item. We will not shop here again!]
