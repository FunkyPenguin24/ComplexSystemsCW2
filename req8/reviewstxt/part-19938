[110276870331824341266,100056584135618966036,Todd was great! He called before coming, said he was on the way and if it was alright that he was a little early. He showed up and explained everything he was doing, how the furnace and air conditioner worked. I also asked him how he likes working for Perfect Home Services and he went on to explain how great of a company it was, how much they cared about the employees and the great training they continuously provide as well as motivation speakers. I will be using them without hesitation from now on. Very happy with the service. Thanks Todd!]
