[110352413189251348897,100302965361079461072,Possibly the Valley's only true mid-size concert venue. Tickets are sometimes reasonably priced and the venue often attracts desirable indie/alternative bands. Expect to go through airport style security when you attend a show here. No liquids over 3 oz. You must remove your shoes and submit to a pat-down. Bouncers are omnipresent, thuggish and never there when you need one. Once inside the terminal don't expect to drown your sorrows in alcohol. Six dollars for pints of PBR, Bud and Bud Light, seven dollar craft and crafty brews, eight dollar well drinks. Expect long delays between sets (30-45 minutes) with little or nothing to entertain you. There is ABSOLUTELY NO RE-ENTRY so you must pick up your merch on the way out. All in all, you can have much the same experience by going to the airport and turning up the tunes. Sweaty, wild eyed will people surround and jostle you. Things are overpriced. You can't leave. Everyone hates the management. If you love airports, this is the venue for you.]
