[114947253488081268210,100427515968224981501,This was the second car that I have purchased at this CarMax in Plano. My sales representative, Jack, was very helpful and took care of me in a timely manner. 10 days with my new car, the engine shut down and gave me a few warning codes. I called Jack and he instructed me to bring the car back ASAP so that they could look at it. 3 days later, my car was fixed and I was able to pick it up. I was a little concerned that my "new" used car was safe to drive, according to their point inspection, but I know that coincidences happen. My only disappointment was when I picked up my 10 day old purchase from the repair facility, it wasn't washed or fueled up. It probably wasn't policy for CarMax to have to do those two items, like they did when I purchased it, but having the car for only 10 days and then already having service performed on it, I guess I was expecting "over the top" service. I received good service but better then poor service, right?]
