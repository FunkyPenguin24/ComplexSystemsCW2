[105473237736044558997,100268408035425780254,When making your selection for the wash it has an option for the attendant to prep the car. I wasn't sure what this was about but for two dollars more I figured what the heck. For two dollars I got a gentleman that pre-sprayed our car, used a brush to SCRUB all of the bugs off the car then actually used his fingers for the hard to reach places. We were travelling through OK on the way to TX and had hit thousands of Oklahoma bugs that previous evening. I wanted to leave these bugs where the had originated and found this place using Google Maps. I guarantee that if I lived in Claremore or within 25 miles this would be the only car wash I would pay for. Great service!]
