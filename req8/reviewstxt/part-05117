[106403888086841951269,100429270496693310407,This is the worst library I've ever had the misfortune to visit; it is almost always loud -- kids crying, screaming, or just jabbering away like they're at the mall instead of a library -- cell phones making their own noise and the noise associated with people rudely talking on them while in the library -- terminals that don't work, so you have to stand in the most ungodly line; librarians that are downright rude -- though a few have been pleasant and helpful -- and just the most ungodly racket and confusion ALL THE TIME -- the librarians apparently have no idea how to be librarians and make people be quiet and respectful to others, nor how to effectively police a rowdy gang of kids. I'm looking for a new library branch IMMEDIATELY, I can't stand this place anymore. Plus, instead of shelving fiction in the time-honored fashion of alphabetizing by the first 3 letters of the author's last name, they have all their fiction shelved by genre, and THEN alphabetized -- which totally eliminates the serendipity of finding some strange book on a subject you never considered before, but take a gamble on and find a great read -- how lame, and how tragic for adventurous readers. On a scale of 1 to 10, I'd give this library a negative 100. The best thing Gwinnett County could do with this place is bulldoze it and start over -- and hire some responsible librarians to keep proper order!]
