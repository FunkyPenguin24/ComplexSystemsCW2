[115441953409549578241,100026631436201926950,I have been to Sunrise Dental of Arlington quite a few times now and I have had one of the most positive medical experiences of my life. The staff is fantastic and friendly, from the front desk to all of the hygenists to the good dentist himself. They are very willing to work with their patience financially with very reasonable payment plans. I had not had any kind of dental work for years prior to seeing this phenomanol team and had quite a few issues. I was treated with the utmost respect and understanding. I would seriously recommend this place to anyone.]
