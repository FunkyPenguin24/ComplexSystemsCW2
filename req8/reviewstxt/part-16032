[115144519611314684154,101022522474994105680,I am forever grateful to Eric Edwards and the Olive Garden team. They were my saving grace for my autumn wedding. Our original reception venue was flooded during the severe storms in September 2013 - right before the wedding. We frantically tried to find a new location to host our wedding reception. We were turned away from several other restaurants, or encountered a booking problem with other venues. We had originally planned on using the Olive Garden as our rehearsal dinner space; so we approached the management team to see if they could accommodate our entire wedding reception. We were told “yes” – and what a relief it was! We had half of the restaurant reserved for our 120 guests. They worked with us in piecing together a well-priced menu, that offered variety for our guests pallets. They even accommodated one of our guests who had Gluten Free needs! We were able to serve wine, soup/salad, an entrée, bread sticks, and desert for a very reasonable price. They also were kind enough to house our wedding cake, and provided the plates and flatware, along with our sparkling cider and stemware for the wedding toast (in lieu of champagne). The staff was super attentive to our guests’ needs, and were very kindly and respectful to our wedding party head table. The best part – they were genuinely happy to have us there. Eric really soothed our concerns, and was very kind, considerate and compassionate. He really impressed me. All in all – this was a great experience. All of our guests left happy, and the bride and groom were happy and relieved.]
