[103746970624428732613,100636891575717373104,I used to climb at Sport Rock until Vertical Rock opened up. After my first climb I fell in love! It is not overcrowded, parking is a LOT easier, and most of all the staff is not only nice but incredibly friendly and you can tell everyone there loves the sport of climbing and just wants to share their love with everyone that comes in! The gym is large, with both small and tall walls, and a really great bouldering wall. The best part... you hardly ever have to wait in line to climb a route or a problem.]
