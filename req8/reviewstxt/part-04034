[102973345571030793719,100370912915155374055,I have been to Angeethi multiple times & I can honestly say each and every time, they exceed my expectations (which are very high) in both food and service. The waitstaff is always super attentive, making sure my water glass is never half empty and that I don't need a refill on my rice! The food always comes out fresh and piping hot... Plus, a fabulous vegetarian menu is available :) A must go in Herndon!]
