[110339090104029830031,100529426499894585853,I first visited Jacob Neal Salon as a new client in September 2012 and I had a wonderful experience. The salon atmosphere, staff and quality of my cut & color were amazing. I highly recommend going to Garrett if you're blonde and want an awesome haircut as well as a fun conversation. While it is pricy, you get what you pay for and at Jacob Neal you get excellence! I am going back for my second appointment in early April.]
