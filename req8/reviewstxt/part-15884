[106851684865749413296,101014858463399214269,I have two children in classes. One child is just beginning. The other is in "Level 3". The instructors are great. The facility is clean and well maintained. The business-side of the business could use some improvement. One reviewer already mentioned having difficulty contacting the staff and receiving a call back. I can attest to that as well. They accommodate working with our schedule and makeups for missed days are typically easy to arrange. On the instruction/learning side of the business, some weeks are better than others. There does not seem to be a well designed discipline or behavior-correcting policy. Some prior classmates listened terribly, and distracted from class. Although class sizes are small (3 kids each), one unruly child makes the whole event fruitless. When it does go right, which is almost all of the time, my children have a fun time and show considerable improvement. The instructors work well with each child, understanding what skills they need to improve upon and coaching with patience.]
