I had a pretty pronounced gap in between the two front teeth and they were just not really straight - long story short, I wasn't happy with it for a number of years. I had a complete smile makeover and it looks wonderful. It looks like I had braces for years and after that had everything whitened. It only took a couple appointments rather than years, and the results are probably better than I would have had if I had gone with the long route. I actually feel good when I smile now - I can do it ear to ear and not wonder what people think.]
