[100480889210478925563,100421462921493567754,I came here for breakfast--so it was a bit dead, but the atmosphere was wonderful. Our waitress was incredibly sweet and friendly--she brought us free samples of their homemade orange juice as well as the bakehouse's sourcream coffee cake. The food is delicious, their french toast is made with 3 vanilla liquors and they know how to cook bacon. I can't wait to come for dinner!]
