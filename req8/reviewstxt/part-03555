[108818455086222144817,100343993226158760278,While visiting from FL my husband had a COPD outbreak with cough and fever. We called and found they were in network with our insurance and when we arrived there was only one patient ahead of us. The MD was a great listener and all the staff was very nice. After a thorough exam they did a nebulizer treatment and took an xray. We then got prescriptions to take. Wonderful folks giving wonderful service!!]
