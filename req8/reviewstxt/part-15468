[114248772657862822521,100991460874043291565,Always been delicious and have had fast service with a smile. Love the prices (use coupons from the portage lakes Gold Clipper), and have been ordering exclusively from this location for 12+ years. Very good pizza, and it blows nasty Dominos, lame Papa John's and greasy boring Pizza Hut out of the water! You've got to try the PB&J pizza, and all the deep dishes are wonderful. Very great crust!! Only place I'll even eat the crust besides Italo's on Waterloo.]
