[103727594666996626010,100090620653027981138,I went here despite the reviews, based on a personal friend's recommendation. She had acrylics put on and she said this was the first time EVER that they didn't come off before her 2-week fill appointment. So I took a chance. I was 15mins late to my appt due to traffic and they had no problem with it. I had the girl (the one every speaks so poorly of I assume) and she was very nice. I had gel nails put on, french style. I am one week in and the nails still look good. I also had my eyebrows waxed as a last minute decision. It was my first time and she was very helpful in understanding that i didn't want a reshape, just touch-up, and did a beautiful job in a comfortable private room. I am going back in 1 week for a fill and pedi with my girls before my wedding. If you are looking for an inexpensive but good quality "typical Asian-run nail salon" for your nail and waxing needs, this is the place for you! If you are turned off by this type of environment, the cheesy decor and non-english mumbling amongst the employees, then this is not the place for you - go to Boulder.]
