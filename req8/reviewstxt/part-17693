[101152663197546092956,101113548211455366439,I ordered `lamb shank pie` @ £13.50 when brought to the table it had a lamb bone sticking out through the mash potato topping. I pulled the bone, it came out and it had no meat on it. I decided then not to eat it but to have a look at what was in there first. The bowl was topped off with 75% mash the rest of the bowl was advertised as `lamb cooked in a red wine sauce` (6 small bits of lamb). There was hardly no sauce in there and it was not cooked any where near red wine (i tasted a small piece). I asked for some red wine sauce but all that was brought back was a small drop of gravy!. At that point the meal was sent back and i left hungry. :-( My point is £13.50 for a meal that would have cost approx £4 or less from `Brakes the wholesaler`. Not happy.]
