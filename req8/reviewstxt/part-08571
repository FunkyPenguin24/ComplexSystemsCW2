[101863584621195731647,100616648198520718139,This is the only dive shop in the immediate area. It holds a decent amount of scuba gear. As a PFI trained freediver and serious underwater photographer this shop continually lets me down on inventory that is of use to me. I also get the impression by the attitudes of the employees that I am "less than" a diver because I choose to explore on a breath hold]
