[105790749902727282826,100591453755330640934,Customer Service is really tested when you have an issue that needs to be resolved. I am happy to say Elyria Hyundaiâ€™s customer service passed with flying colors when I encountered an issue post purchasing a vehicle and sales rep, Mari Veliz, went above and beyond to help me reach a resolution that made me feel pleased with my purchase. Thank you to Jeff, GSM, for your help as well.]
