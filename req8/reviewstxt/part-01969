I rented a vehicle three times from this location in the past month and only one time did they check in the vehicle correctly the next morning. This last time I even took a picture of the odometer when I left it in FRONT of their location and they accused me that I kept the vehicle for an entire week! Talk about ballsy attitude towards a customer. Frankly, they've left a really bad taste. Not sure I'll ever do business with them again.]
