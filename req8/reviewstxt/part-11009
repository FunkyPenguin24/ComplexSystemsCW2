[101176539558993487412,100748393880550824860,Terrible! I had the Texas BBQ with a gluten free base (only available in small?) with no cheese (lactose free cheese is available but not on offer here for some strange reason) no alternative topping was offered, although if you want extra cheese it costs the same as an extra topping so you would have thought they'd offer a replacement for the cheese...but no. When it arrived I laughed out loud. To say the amount of toppings put on were meagre would be an understatement. 6 (one for every slice) small 1 inch by half inch strip of bacon that didn't taste of anything. Minute particles of chicken, which again tasted of nothing and a few green (only green?) peppers. The BBQ sauce was the only thing they were generous with (probably because there was no cheese) but it tasted sickly sweet. Overall for the price I could have made a couple of large gluten free pizzas (with lactose free cheese) that actually taste like a pizza. There is a reason why I don't eat takeaway food that often, because it is just plain awful as well as being unhealthy for you.]
