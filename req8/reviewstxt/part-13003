[116578801693422090090,100857146688987399511,In all accounts of history the teaching of Jesus Christ say that he believed in helping thy neighbor love and caring for not only those who followed him but also those who didn't. He showed in many ways that people should help one another. At Timberlake Christian Schools they teach "traditional" Christian values set forth in the Bible like hate those who are different, Love thy neighbor as long as they believe what you believe, Throw those who are different into the streets, Love those who have deep wallets and large bank accounts. These all must be traditional and in the Bible since they claim it and act in this way. All Christians and non Christians should be insulted by this institution. And they wonder whay people are walking away from churches.]
