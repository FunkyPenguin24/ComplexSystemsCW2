[112119202824594793397,100652637765900652650,My fiancé and I were specifically looking for locally-owned mattress stores in the northern virginia area and came across Urban Mattress, which had great reviews on all of the local sites (yelp, google) and mattress underground. I also really wanted a latex mattress because latex is more environmentally-friendly (although frequently more expensive). I did my homework before going to any stores, and found Nathaniel, the owner of Urban Mattress, to be incredibly honest, and easy to work with. The 100% talalay (highest quality latex) mattresses were all comfortable and affordable, but Nathaniel suggested my fiancé and I try out a talalay/soy foam mattress that was less expensive, which we ultimately bought and are incredibly happy with! We also love the two pillows we bought, the free local shipping, and the 2% of sales donated to a local charity. Urban Mattress was a great find!]
