The adjustments we receive are exactly what is need. Dr. Devine has a team that listen to what we are experiencing and they track down and correct the cause! I've never experienced feeling rushed or harassed - so rare in any doctors office. So while I may have to wait a bit - I know my care will be about what I need because they listen. If you want to have a chiropractor team that will help you in how YOU want to heal - then you have found them! From deep adjustments to light gentle touch. And the Graston .. Amazing! See - told you they were divine!]
