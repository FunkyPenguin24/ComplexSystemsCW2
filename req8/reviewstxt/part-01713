[110673347341258306717,100248096112680815279,Went through the drive-thru. The person taking our order was very unfriendly. My wife and I wanted corn instead of slaw. They were out. We ordered green beans instead. Without giving us a total, he asked us to pull forward. At the window, he told us they were also out of green beans. Asked what they weren't out of. They told us we could either take the slaw or get extra hushpuppies. They didn't offer anything at all or even say sorry. Cancelled our order and ordered one cookie (so that we could have a receipt). They gave us our cookie and tried to not give us a receipt at all. Could hear the manager repeating "they cancelled the order" over and over in a very rude way. Had to yell into the window to get them to notice I wanted a receipt at all.]
