[113475615186671902651,100044368488235152825,I don't understand why there are any bad reviews of this car wash... maybe they got it mixed up with another one. Anyway, it is excellent. Great customer service and just such a friendly staff. I went to just get a wash and then decided on getting a car detail. We had dog hair all over our car.... They were able to inexpensively clean all of it out. Our Subaru Outback looks brand new again. They are very "detail" oriented and work with you to make sure everything gets super clean.]
