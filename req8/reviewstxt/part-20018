[102250986789579477120,100061269323273815931,To car owners of Scott Clark Honda, I recommend Kelsey Pasley to get some answers about conjoining the Bluetooth device to your car. I was very confused when I read through the manual by myself, but when I called Scott Clark Honda, Kelsey Pasley answered the telephone and ran me through step-by-step and helped me figure out how to hook them up together. She was considerate and very accommodating to my Bluetooth needs. Don't hesitate to make a call and ask for Kelsey, because you wont be disappointed! Also, when you stop by to pay your bill, or any other financial needs, look for Erin Hewitt because she is also a wonderful employee that I recommend! She was so sweet and helpful! She explained everything about the bill paying process and I was very pleased to hear such a admirable attitude even though it was such a busy day when I came in!]
