[101804031050290020758,100768750980785865452,Great place for Hakata-style ramen - soup is made from pork stock, so it's definitely very hearty. There's a wide selection of soups, ingredients, and even noodles. You can pick various thicknesses/textures for noodles for your liking. The wait isn't as crazy as other trendy ramen shops, but there's still a decent queue at night.]
