[115936174092786174749,100720272524497246629,One of Florida's best! I've been in nearly every dive store in Florida and have rarely seen such a heads up operation. SCUBAdventures has received the Naples Daily News Southwest Florida Choice Champion 8 years straight! The entire staff are very experienced instructors, having trained thousands of students in Open Water on up through Instructor levels. They are also specialists in unique training like underwater photography & video, emergency procedures, spearfishing, freediving and technical diving. I like a dive shop loaded with gear, and Kevin has packed the place with diverse equipment from Scubapro, Zeagle, Sherwood, Aeris, Cressi, TUSA, O'Neill and more. Repairs are another forte' of SCUBAdventures. Never have I seen such a large following of divers going on trips and attending social activities! Scheduled this year are big trips to Dominica, Bonaire, Bahamas, Dry Tortugas and Grenada. Monthly Florida dives are planned to the Keys, Ft. Lauderdale, Pompano, West Palm, Jupiter and the best wrecks in the Gulf of Mexico.]
