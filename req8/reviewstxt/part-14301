[113595399651445566647,100928597567500784160,I love Woody's Drive-In. Fantastic food at fantastic prices. I go in at least once a week. it's just one of those places. Great value, friendly service. I gave it a "poor-fair" rating on decor because the place is old, rickety, and not very well maintained. But you know... I'm pretty sure that keeps their prices low, and that's fine by me!]
