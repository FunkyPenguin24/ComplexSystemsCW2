[110676001692657888054,100418827576628387643,Only a 45 minute drive from Portland, this is one my favorite places in the Gorge to go and relax for a weekend. For less than $30 a day you can soak in a mineral pool, swim, take a nap, read a book and feel so good afterwards. I love their lobby and beautiful fireplace - it is nothing fancy but it sure is relaxing! Well worth the stay]
