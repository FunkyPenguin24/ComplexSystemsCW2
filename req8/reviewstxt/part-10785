[114344052507042590524,100735475866229927824,This is the 2nd time the tech Adam has done work for us. He has been thorough with the work, patient & responsive to my questions and offers suggestions or ideas to our problems (family home is 60 yrs old w/ galvinized plumbing!) Gene Johnson Plumbing has installed a new hot water tank, new plumbing from the kitchen drain and this last visit was to fix some things in our small half bath (leaking toilet/leaking sink). Adam worked on the last two projects and did a great job. I have to say the customer service is excellent (both via the phone and the techs in person)......and you pay for that. As others mentioned they are not cheap so I expect the work & customer service to be of a higher standard and thus far it is. We need to have all the galvinized replaced in the future and hope that Adam is still available when the time comes.]
