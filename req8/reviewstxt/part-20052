[108486317361339207664,100063176137495779609,This is one of the most organized and well ran stores in town. They always have something from the moment you walk into the store. The customer service is top and I'm very appreciative of when the lines was long of course, because of the holiday season, they're quick to get help to move things along with out a stress. 5 STARS]
