[105736356457876707594,101113100098491298083,I visited SCMS 2 weeks ago for laser hair removal. My entire experience was excellent. The office staff is friendly, professional, and thorough. The facility is clean, easy to get to, and I don't think I waited more than a total of 5 minutes the whole time I was there. I was asked to fill out a short questionnaire about my skin type in order to ensure I would respond well to the treatment and to ensure I didn't have any skin conditions that would prevent me from having laser hair removal. Erin, the office manager also showed me a brief presentation on the procedure which was informative and made me feel completely comfortable with the procedure. The PA was very professional and the treatment didn't take longer than 10 minutes, there was a tiny bit of discomfort just from the suction of the laser, but on a scale of 0-10 I'd rate the pain at a 2. After one treatment, I have already noticed my hair growing back thinner and there is less of it. I would 100% recommend SCMS based off of my experience.]
