[115330445345921530648,100236948348597602806,I have been to about a dozen different medical doctors over the years to help relieve my lower back pain and all they ever seem to do is mask my problem. As soon as I stop using their prescribed medicine, the pain reveals itself again. When I was referred to Dr. Eric and met him, I instantly knew this was the person and the place that would relieve my pain for good. It started with a very thorough meeting where Dr. Eric took the time to listen to my problems, concerns, and fears. He educated me on why I never recieved results previously and showed me in a way I could easily understand why his establisment and treatment methods were the right choice to provide me with the results I wanted. I followed his advice and now I can say I no longer have lower back pain. Not only is Dr. Eric amazing, his staff is just as competent and professional. I am extremely happy with my experience at Dynamic Total Health and would recommend them to everyone.]
