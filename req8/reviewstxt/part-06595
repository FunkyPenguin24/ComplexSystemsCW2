[100875966334821034538,100510241612486866020,This is a wonderful little market filled with surprises and owner Jimmy is a wealth of information which he'll gladly share if you ask. He educated me on balsamic vinegars, for instance, did you know you can easily spend say, 150.00 on a bottle of balsamic vinegar? Jimmy says they're priced much like wines. He also pointed my girlfriend to a fabulous bottle of balsamic vinegar for an even more fabulous price stating it was probably the best for your money. Jimmy, you're the best!]
