[108465408061519520166,100111931456153635291,Went there today, absolutely great experience. Fabio, Michael & Carlos were all extremely friendly and helpful. I've gone to other dealerships, especially places that sell Ducatis, and so often they're very snooty. That couldn't have been less the case here, and 100% honest, me and my friend came in looking a little trashy. But it was great. If these guys have a bike you're interested in this is the place I recommend you go, even if it's a bit of a drive out of your way.]
