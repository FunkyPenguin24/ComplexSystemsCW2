[104815867869550307020,100258560503301353178,I eat at Elmo's once a week because I work down the street. I call ahead for my lunch pick up and it's ready within 20 minutes. The staff is always nice and I usually only need to spend a few minutes inside picking up my order. When I took my girlfriend there for her fist time for a romantic dinner, she absolutely loved the food and she wants me to take her back there. Great place for seafood or burgers]
