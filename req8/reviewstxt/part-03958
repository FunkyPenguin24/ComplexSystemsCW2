[107244855293912893531,100367063509859626171,We go to Sabai Thai a couple of times each month and the food is always excellent. Everything is extremely fresh, and their spices make the dishes come alive. The staff is very friendly, and the service is fast and proficient. In the 100+ times we've eaten there, we've never had a single bad experience at Sabai Thai. Just thinking about it is making me ridiculously hungry!]
