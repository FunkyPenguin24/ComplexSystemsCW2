[112991183364041018876,100792527487627169268,I will NEVER visit this station again. Their prices were unbelievably high for no reason other than a Brentwood address. I just purchased E85 at a station further towards downtown Nashville, for 2.99 a gallon. Literally 3 days later, I bought a tank of E85 at this station. The cost was 3.49 a gallon. I didn't even realize the price was so much higher until I had made the purchase, but that is beside the point. I checked back online at the price of the other E85 station- it was still 2.99! That is right 50cents per gallon higher at this station. I will never buy anything at this station again and will tell my friends to avoid it as well.]
