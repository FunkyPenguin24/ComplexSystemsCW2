[118384575139236138513,100264902938596837601,Our experience with Hamstra has continued to be a joy for over 22 years, and recently when we had to replace our old system, the experience was just as excellent as it always has been! Everyone from our first contact (Randy McDonnell) to the last worker finishing the project, were professional, efficient, and knowledgable, as well as fun to be around! They made getting a new funace/AC a very quick and painless experience, and we would recommend them to everyone! Thank you for keeping us warm this winter!]
