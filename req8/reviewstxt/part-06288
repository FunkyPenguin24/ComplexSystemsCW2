[107410571581687685352,100491660449399090908,We have been going to the Tomato Factory for 20 years and have never been disappointed. The food is always delicious. Frank, the owner, is very personable and remembers your name! The Tomato Factory has the best calamari we have ever tasted. This place is a gem of a restaurant. Our younger son even proposed at the Tomato Factory!]
