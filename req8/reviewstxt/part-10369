The staff was courteous and friendly, the shop is open on Saturdays (many are not), and they gave me a price quote within a day of my car's being in the shop. The staff seems genuinely professional, a throw-back, as other reviews have noticed. However, as others have noted, the quote I received was full of upsell. The mechanic recommended over $2,000 worth of repairs, which is at or over the listed value of the car. Admittedly, the car is old and has many issues, which the mechanic duly and rightly noted. When I requested that he give me an estimate for a bare-minimum repair to get the car running safely and pass inspection, the quote remained near $1,100. (These were done orally over the phone, so there may not be a written record of them). I took the car to another local shop, who did the repair for just over $400. The mechanic there, when shown the report from Advanced, was baffled as to how several of the "issues" in the ~$2,000 quote, specifically those regarding the fuel-injection system, could be diagnosed without a more time-intensive review than was possible (I don't necessarily believe or disbelieve this from the other mechanic; I simply report what he told me). To my mind and in my experience, Advanced's business model is to upsell its services, recommending expensive repairs which may or may not be necessary. This is a perfectly legitimate business practice that maximizes profits and likely does involve much preventive maintenance, particularly for newer cars. If money is no concern and you want a quick and what I presume would be effective repair from a local business with polite and professional employees, Advanced is your shop. The savvy customer may look elsewhere or for a second opinion, however.]
