[117492935658634969707,100847308052126272160,This is just my impression of this particular employee and does not reflect how i feel about the company..... I called looking for a part (tires) for my trailer that i purchased from uhaul. the guy that picked up the phone just said."bring your trailer to make sure i am giving you the right part" i told him that i had the brand and exact tire size. I also told him that i had called another location where i had bought them before but that they where sold out. he then told me "oh!! if they are sold out in that location i can't sell them to you" .. The guy didn't even asked me for the tire size or either bother to check... i am just surprised how people can be so careless about how they conduct business.]
