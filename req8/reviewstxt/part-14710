[114994813368152239832,100950916636365564509,I've been to Apatura a couple of times with friends. The service is good, while not being annoying like some places. The staff are friendly and the food is really good. The prices for the drinks and the courses are affordable as well. If you are looking for a quiet, pleasant evening out try this place.]
