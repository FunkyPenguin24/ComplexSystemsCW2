[106481644011455715182,101030340185181284333,I can’t say enough good things about the kids Jiu-Jitsu program at Manassas MMA, led by Michelle Welti. My wife and I were looking for a legitimate gym for our 6 year old son to start his walk with mixed martial arts. We have definitely found that at Manassas MMA. Witnessing the growth in our son’s self-confidence, respect for others, and discipline has been amazing! Michelle has a way with kids that many people don’t; this makes her perfect for the job. As a parent, words can’t describe how awesome this is. Some people just have a gift for teaching and working with children, and Michelle is by far one of those people.]
