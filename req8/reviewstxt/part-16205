[115249436999358377881,101031944250998967798,Scott Adams was one of the best sales representative that I have ever had the opportunity to meet. I felt that I freely walked around the lot and that we were not pushed or rushed to make a decision. In addition, as we were walking around he answered questions about the cars that we were looking at and helped us to make a decision on a used vehicle that fit our needs beautifully. Myself and my fiance are looking at another car in the next few months and we would come back to see Scott for now and for our future. We could not have had a better deal on the car and Scott could not have been more honest, or nice about what we were getting, and we are very happy.]
