[101068803132423723772,100779699635057306026,The place is clean and looks nice enough but the staff is rude and act inconvenienced by your arrival, even though the cost of the images are pretty substantial. I walked in and wasn't greeted by Becca (only knew her name because of name tag), and she was hateful from the start. While she is getting papers out, I receive a phone call from the tech named Janet. Apparently she was calling because they were ahead of schedule and I showed up a few minutes past the (early 30 minute) mark. So Becca yells at Janet through my phone demanding she hang up because I'm standing right there, so Janet does just that. After dealing with a 'still rude' Becca, Janet came to get me to take me to wardrobe. After I went in the changing room, I had a question, so I stepped out to find these two going at it about who was right/who was wrong. (Becca was wrong, Janet was doing nothing wrong). Laying in one spot for 2 1/2 hours caused severe back pain (the reason for my need of an MRI), and when asked to sit up, I was given 0 help, and the tech (not Janet) was rude when instructing me how to deal with the CD. Now, Becca's attitude was different on the way out, but at that point my experience had been so bad, I didn't even care. I would recommend you go somewhere else for your imaging needs until these people instruct their employees how to deal with customers, especially when the customers are paying a pretty outrageous amount for the images. Good luck!]
