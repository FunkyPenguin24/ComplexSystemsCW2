[115427140226803142768,100317884318033408230,My first experience with Fix-A-Frame dated back to 1999. The environment was warm and friendly and the art on display was amazing! The owner of Fix-A-Frame, David Schummy still has the old fashion way of servicing the customer- first class service and always opens the door for his delighted customers. Be ready to be entertained and involved by him whilst learning lots during the two way custom design process. He framed my Moon Oil Painting personally- still today is much loved by me.]
