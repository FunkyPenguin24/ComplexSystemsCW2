[114366838051342288545,101113678996420293074,The first time my wife and I went here we were blown away by the quality of the service and food. Most of the similar places we had eaten at you could barely taste the food under the salty seasonings and microwave reheating. Everything we've had at the Longhorn has been perfectly cooked and seasoned to enhance flavor instead of cover poor quality ingredients. The prices are a bit higher than at similar places but not enough to matter, I think we figured we spend about 10.00 more on our total bill.]
