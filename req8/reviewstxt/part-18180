[101391908390867093152,101139702208323783548,My (then) fiance and I booked Harmit after finding him on the web and reviewing his gallery of photos. He gets exactly the kind of shots we were looking for, natural, un- posed pictures that really captured the essence of the day and boy did he deliver :) He arrived on time and captured the arrival of the Groom and our guests and also managed to fit some time in to capture my and my bridesmaids getting ready. A big plus for us was that he was really unintrusive, it was almost as though he wasn't there. I have been a guest at wedding before where the photographer has been rather bossy but Harmit was great and captured every moment of our special day in photos that we will treasure forever. Highly recommended and many thanks :)]
