[117506369336038252802,100344696486338579070,January 2013 I am a Chef and I shop at this food lion sometime. it is close to my home and conveniently situated off the expressway on the way home. I often get what I need for my home here, but I have noticed that the buyers do not stock this store with the same quality of fresh food items as I see in the other like names stores. Namely Colonial Heights and Chester. (that food) I started this review off giving this store 4 stars but because of poor customer service I think I will drop it down to 3 stars. (January 28, 2013) Called the 800# to get a direct line to this store. Called and asked about sleds. with out even checking, i was told no we do not have any. I said I was there last night (8:00pm) you're out of them completely? "I'm assuming that we are cause I don't see any." ***CLICK*** WHAT THE HECK DID SHE JUST HANG UP ON ME? OMG. We really need to train staff on proper phone etiquette. Thanks loyally Food Lion customer, Willing to go out of the way to avoid this poor service.]
