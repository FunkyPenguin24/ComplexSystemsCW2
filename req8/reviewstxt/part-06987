[100385070208047411463,100532283615992494238,Update. On Jan 1st 2013 I ordered General Tso's Chicken. It was one of the worst attempts at this dish I have had at a Chinese restaurant. The cuts of chicken had large amounts of gristle and sinew. Instead of the traditional General Tso's sauce they used a bland duck sauce with little spice. The store front was filthy.]
