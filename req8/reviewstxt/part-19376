[104446844667577560420,100026287249649908342,I had the sesami chicken and crab rangoon. Main Moon used to be such a good place for take out. Something has changed. The food quality has fallen off greatly. They used to have nice meaty pieces of chicken in their sesami chicken. Now it is mostly thick pieces of fried dough with a tiny piece of chicken in them. The crab rangoon used to have noticeable pieces of crab meat that you could also taste. Not anymore. Now it is 99.9% creamcheese and .1% crab. I guess decided to cut corners to make money. Well I'm looking for a new Chinese take out place.]
