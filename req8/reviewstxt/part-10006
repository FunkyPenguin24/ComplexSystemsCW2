[102003518264794640425,100693934087377409977,Great experience for my 30k service. Called 2 days in advance to schedule, arrived the morning of my service was promptly helped and given my loaner car. Loaner car was in great shape. I was called when the work was complete and picked up my car which is running like new. Ive been to 2 other Subaru service centers and this has been my best experience to date. Everything is professional and written in detail. Do not hesitate to visit. Highly recommended.]
