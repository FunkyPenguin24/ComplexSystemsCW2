[100142353654839858228,100533739887424893459,I took my car into their shop as it was blowing only hot air from my air conditioning. Anthony and the guys took a look at what was wrong and informed me that it was the pressure switch wires that were the issue. I appreciated them being honest about it and actually showing me the problem instead of guessing at it and/or selling me on things I don't need in order to fix the problem. I enjoyed the shop and would take my car back there again.]
