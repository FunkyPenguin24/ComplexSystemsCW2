[113831648805807938867,100279130852420362620,I had called these people February 1st to have someone to come out. A week went by with no call back, so i called them back to see whats going on. It turned out that the assistant there did not put a work order in. After the hot tub guy came out he told me i need to dis assemble the hot tub and take the pump out so I did. He had picked up the pump on 2/13/14. I spoke to Larry on the following Monday to get a update. Nothing has been done. he called me on Wednesday 2/19/14 and said that he has the pump and that he will have his guy come out Thursday to drop it off, and that he couldn't do it that day because he was up at the mountain already. No show no phone call. so i called them today and Candice had told me that Larry is the only guy working and that the other guy had a cold and has been out of the office for a week and that it is just the two of them. So who was the guy up on the mountain on Thursday? I am still waiting to here back, when i do i will let you guys know how this concludes.]
