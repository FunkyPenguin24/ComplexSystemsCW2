[100407908925303494525,100058322956433074594,I went to take a test drive of the Outlander Sport, they had the car I was looking for and worked hard to get to a price I could live with. I dealt with Luke, Rob, and finally Andy. They were not pushy and explained the facts from their side and listened to my point of view. We reached a deal quickly and I think the entire process was done under 2 hours. I did not think it was possible to complete the transaction in such a short time but they made it happen. the dealership is small and motivated. I would recommend to friends and family.]
