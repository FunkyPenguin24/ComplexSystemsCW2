[114105662281634175051,101036568408996326824,I have to stress that the merchandisers were very nice to me. They tried to price-match my product according to policy. However, the manager, Ken, is completely incompetent and straight-out told me that he wouldn't price match my product because it was too big of a discount. His idiocy has convinced me that I should never step foot in a Best Buy ever again. For them to hire someone so unprofessional speaks volumes about their company.]
