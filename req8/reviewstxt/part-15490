[100672196760604376318,100992860401594135277,The good: Friendly staff and quick service. HUGE portions. BYOB. Large pieces of shrimp in the Pad Thai. The not so good: Not at all authentic or even particularly interesting - gave me cabbage, not bean sprouts, no peanuts, no tamarind, no lime. No alcohol at all unless you bring it yourself. And the prices are expensive - I got charged $6 to put some meat into my pad thai, which it didn't say on the menu. The bad: They don't' accommodate larger groups very well. They won't take reservations for them and they made us wait a half hour to be seated.]
