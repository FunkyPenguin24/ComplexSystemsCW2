[103126718865185189417,100628112089579101762,I ordered the shrimp pad Thai and it was amazing. I ordered my "Thai spicy" and they did just that for me. We ordered the cheapest Pino Nior on the menu which was $65 and tasted like the bottle had been open for a week (yes, we paid for the bottle but never saw him open it). I am torn on this review because the food was so good, but the wine was so bad. I got sick about an hour after this meal as did my husband and the only item that we shared, was the wine.]
