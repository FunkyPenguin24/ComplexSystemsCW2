[114693969592696101318,100832868882098889309,I chose Heart 2 Heart halfway through my pregnancy when my husband and I decided to go all natural. I was so thankful for the knowledgeable and caring attention of the midwives and support staff. I looked forward to every appointment, and I felt more like family than a patient. I do not have a single negative memory as I look back on my labor and delivery. They took great care of me and baby, and my husband was welcomed and encouraged to participate in the process. I will be using Heart 2 Heart when it is time for baby #2.]
