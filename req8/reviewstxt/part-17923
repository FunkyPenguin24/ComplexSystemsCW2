[106068859798412773064,101124753108199421250,Well, we're about to set off for our fourth holiday in a row at Landhaus Koessel, driving 16 hours from London, so make what you will of that. Lovely facilities, friendly owners always welcome us back, and about 100 feet off the lakeside in one of the most beautiful places on earth. All mod cons, all facilities, and natural beauty to the max. Cycling, horse riding, paragliding, hiking, you name it. Amazing. CAN'T WAIT!]
