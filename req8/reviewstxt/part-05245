[112317255161044895568,100438216083628066239,I have nothing but good things to say about this Public Storage!! Working with Jason made the process so easy and comfortable! I never wanted to place my belongings in storage, but found myself needing to. I called several places, and finally spoke with Jason. After just 5 minutes on the phone with him, I knew this was the place for me! He totally made both my husband and myself feel as though he "personally" was keeping 24 hour armed watch over our stuff. I tell people every chance I get, to only rent from him! Thank you Jason! Shannon Wells and Henry Correa JR]
