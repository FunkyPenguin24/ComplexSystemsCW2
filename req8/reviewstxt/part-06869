[108143799843648096474,100525821714981220317,I'm sure that weddings and other events at Veritas are beautiful since the venue looks so pretty just during normal holidays, but if you're just going for wine tasting... I wouldn't. The tasting room wasn't too crowded on a Sunday afternoon, but it still took 10-15 minutes for service. The wines weren't spectacular--I'm glad the pours weren't overly generous. The smaller vineyards around the area have much better flavor. The patio is a nice spot for a picnic, but the views are average for the beauty of the area.]
