[117609053858170497325,100125007943633644745,I found Rooter-Man through the yellow pages in my local phone book and I'm so happy I did. The representative was here well within the time promised, he accessed the problem and solution within minutes, explained all the pro's and con's, the procedure and price up-front. David was professional, truly a gentlemen and I felt complete comfort and relief that he was able to address and fix our problem. At the conclusion of the work he made sure that everything was in working order and even went a step further to peek in the septic tank. He also introduced me to a product they sell which will help in making sure this same problem doesn't happen again. AND...to top it off, the company even gives you a 'sweet' parting gift. I would recommend Rooter-Man and David R. any day of the week. Thank you.]
