[101330667946411280840,100102922793962399122,Great german-style chips (thin & crunchy rather than thick & soggy) and curried sausages at (for London) reasonable prices. There's room for a few people to sit, but traditionally it's "to go". A little bit of a german train-station near Charing Cross. Try the chips in the traditional "rot-weiss" (red-white, ie, with ketchup and mayonaise) style.]
