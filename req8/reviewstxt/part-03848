Both of our daughters are patients of Dr. Campbell and after 3 years we feel like family. They are very accomodating for working parents, and school schedules. Any concerns we had about our eldest daughters care, was addressed immediately. When she had to have oral surgery (from forseen circumstances) they assisted us through the entire procedure (additional insurance needs etc) and even told us about the different oral surgeons in the area that specialized in the procedure we needed to have done. I can truly say when my youngest is finished in another year, we will miss the office on Leesville Road.]
