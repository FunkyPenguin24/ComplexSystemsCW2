[106211657583795377275,100216698152081152530,I don't have any children, but I do coach for a summer swim team in the area. My younger swimmers that learn from Goldfish are far more advanced in comparison to other kids in their age group (by a large margin). The child-focus approach they bring to teaching children how to swim blows away any other program. Kids love swimming at Goldfish and with their heated pool, fun teachers, colorful environment, and a ton of games and prizes, why wouldn't they??? When I have children I will undoubtedly send my kids to their program.]
