[103676588645969729756,100751031189084294260,I rarely write reviews but I feel I have to in this case. We stopped in because we were driving through and saw the exceptional Zagat score (27). I am completely baffled by this score. The food may be "good" relative to other mexican restaurants above the 45th parallel, but it was definitely not in the "Extraordinary to Perfection" range. The meat in our dishes was good (flavorful and tender), but everything else was average or poor. The tortillas, rice, and beans were typical of Michigan Mexican. The guacamole was the worst I have every been served. It appeared to be an artificial pale green colored liquid from a plastic packet with no evidence of actually containing any vegetables. The service was a bit sparse but acceptable. The decor was brightly colored, typical of a cheesy mexican chain, and the facilities were clean and well kept.]
