[101625807242148867161,100680251870685598824,I was at Galvin's last weekend. This is in Kentucky, which is horse racing country. The manager refused to put the audio on for one of the biggest races of the decade because he felt that nobody was watching it. Didn't matter because the entire bar went crazy as they finished the race, but it did show how many people were watching the race. I really like the food at Galvin's, and most of the staff are generally friendly, but the way that I was treated by the manager last weekend means that i will not visit Galvin's again.]
