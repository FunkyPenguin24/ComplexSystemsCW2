[101755790937861176175,100753064158743268418,We've gone there several times. Service is slow and employees are rude and incompetent. It looks as if they are more interested in flirting with each other than waiting on customers. On two separate occasions we waited at the drive thru to order and no one addressed us. We had to drive up to the window and order there. On two other separate occasions we placed an order for 2 vanilla cones and one twist cone. The order was read back as 2 vanilla cones. When asked about the twist cone they replied that their chocolate isn't working. The employee was just going to ignore the order for the twist cone instead of informing me that there is no chocolate. I've had it with that place. I can go to McDonalds for the same size vanilla cone but CHEAPER and FASTER.]
