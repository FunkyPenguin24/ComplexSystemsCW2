[103882718392461381781,101101625327901289028,I don't care what anyone else has said about this Florist! I was given two dozen beautiful yellow roses for an anniversary and they were AMAZING! I received so many compliments on them, they were like mini sunflowers. The whole presentation, the box with tissue paper and the vase were perfect. I still have people asking where I got them! We will not buy anywhere else. If you think they are expensive, I believe they are worth the extra money. Thank you Hunny, you did well!]
