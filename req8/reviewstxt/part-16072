[107074570481589593971,101024991938661304998,Get here early for lunch, or you will find yourself waiting for a table! The food is pretty darn good, but for the price, you just can't beat it!! My meal is under $5 every time, and it includes soup and an egg roll (I always just get water)!! The food is such a HUGE serving that I always go home with a FULL to-go box!! *LoL* I definitely recommend this place for the value of it.]
