[106591152998943949330,100855202566559829435,Looking Glass Photo is a good neighborhood store that stocks a wide variety of equipment and materials at fair prices. They also do digital printing, and sell Mac set-ups for photographers. Not as cheap as the NYC online stores, but the service makes up for it, and they're open 7 days a week for instant gratification.]
