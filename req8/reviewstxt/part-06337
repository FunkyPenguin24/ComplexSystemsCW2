[109753951665559881782,100494632126264333908,My four years at Bellarmine from 2006 - 2010 have been nothing short of phenomenal. The teachers were all dedicated to making my experience very enjoyable while setting high expectations and standards for my own intellectual engagement and growth. The campus has been managed very well from a student's perspective and has provided me with the tools to succeed at the university level. In short, I loved every minute of my experience here and still keep in touch with a few beloved teachers and peers.]
