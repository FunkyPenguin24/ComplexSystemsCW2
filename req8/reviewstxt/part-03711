[100354486701772694114,100353752569753737405,We had a Weimaraner that we would only board at lucky's. He was very nervous and anxious dog and luckys was great with him. He was able to stay in his own room, rather than cage or run (he was returned with a torn up nose from staying with in a chain link fence elsewhere), and he was able to be by himself in a large room with a mat/blanket, rather than have to socialize with other dogs as he was not great in large groups or with certain temperament types. He was always returned in good health and the customer service we experienced was top notch. Our bichon was also boarded there and she was treated wonderfully. I highly recommend luckys pet resort, especially if you have a high needs dog, it was worth our drive for our peace of mind.]
