[100823185461796793453,100147094927476057991,The Restaurant Aux Vieux Canons was recommended to us as a good French restaurant and so we felt compelled to visit. The night before we dined at Auberge Louis-Hébert (which is right next door) and so our expectations were rather high. The woman who led us into the restaurant said, "The portions are very very ample!" That should have been the red light we needed, revealing this place isn't really a French joint. We ignored it and sat down. The waiter was really wonderful and helpful. We ordered from the 30.00 prix fix menu... and maybe that was the issue. The Escargots à l'ail was doused in far too much garlic. The Paté de campagne was just yucky. But maybe that's just Paté, I don't know. I ordered the Émincé de boeuf sauce au vin but the waiter suggested I get the NY Strip instead, which I did. (I learned long ago to listen to waiters, they truly know best). It was dry and the veggies that came with it were bland. Dessert was included. It was Crepe Capucine. Dessert was enjoyable but it was just a scoop of vanilla ice cream on a simple crepe with some maple syrup drizzled over it. Maybe if we had ordered from the more expensive menu the food would have been better. Regardless, we spent about the same amount at Auberge Louis-Hébert and were blown away by their meal. I wouldn't recommend this place...]
