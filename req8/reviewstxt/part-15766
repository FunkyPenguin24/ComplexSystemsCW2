[102114408503467441305,101008200526355833740,This is one of the best climbing gyms I have ever been to! Not only are the routes interesting and different, but also the staff and community that supports this gym are incomparable. I am a mediocre climber who usually feels intimidated by the unfriendly hulk climbers that would usually hang around a a climbing gym. Not once have I even remotely experienced that at Vital. I typically climb there twice a week and have never had anything but rave reviews of this place. Most the time I can show up by myself and find people I don't know to climb with. If you are even debating visiting the place, just go! It's a great for hanging out and I even use it as my makeshift office when necessary. I have met climbers of all levels there, but all of them are willing to lend a hand or share beta. This is one gym that really knows how to foster a community.]
