Many dishes were authentic Chinese, but the natural flavors were masked by the unhealthy amount of oil and salt. Also, many dishes are spicy, so if you don't like spice then there are not many dishes to choose from. The soups were just broth- hardly any vegetables or meat in it. Also, the manager was very unkind, and forced us to pay more. It is also a little more expensive than the other Chinese restaurants in the area. Bottom line: I would not recommend this to a friend, but if you feel like this suits your taste, then go ahead.]
