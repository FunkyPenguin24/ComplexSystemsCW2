[110736208250432190231,100431785021492311049,Three years ago, I brought my dog Zeus to Dr. Douglas because he had a bad ear infection in both ears. I had brought Zeus to two other Vet offices and they both gave him the same treatment; needless to say these treatments didn't fix the problem and his ear infection worsened. So, I brought Zeus to Dr. Douglas in hopes that she could fix his ears. Dr. Douglas and her team were very friendly and took time to get to know Zeus’s story and the past treatments that had been done to his ears. She then came up with her own way to treat the problem and it worked! Finally! Dr. Douglas is very kind and is not a 'one size fits all' Dr., she looks at each case differently and will do whatever it takes to get the problem solved. Zeus is now a very happy dog and no longer cries when I pet him or shakes his head constantly because his ears hurt. This past year, Zeus ruptured both of his anal glands. Again, she quickly fixed the problem and Zeus returned to his normal self. I have never felt so sure of a veterinarian before now and will be a lifelong customer of Dr. D’s.]
