[111215727698773172503,100414566815516418263,It all started when I bought an “Acura Certified” vehicle, which they did not bother to do the certification on. After asking about it, the used car manager (Brad Johnson) , stated “well it shouldn’t have been sold as certified”. They did do SOME of the certified things, but only what I asked about. It also turned out to be a smoker’s car, which is NOT good. They GUARANTEED that they would get rid of the smell and had it treated. After a couple treatments, it seemed better. Well, when the weather got cold and damp, I could really smell the smoke from the plastic in the vents. Now that they can’t get rid of the smell and I don’t want them to “hide” the smell for a couple weeks. They will only give me trade-in value, wow loose $12,000 in 12 months. OUCH!! Not to mention poor customer service when you bring in for repairs. I would NOT buy or bring anything to them again.!!]
