[112934497533662332926,101154127572472663226,Our family has been visiting Umpqua's Last Resort for several years now, and each year just gets better. We've tent camped, stayed in the luxurious camping cabins, and recently booked a fully stocked vacation rental. Our children look forward to going every year as the hiking, swimming and waterfalls are like no other. The staff is extremely friendly, warm and inviting, always helpful and quick to respond, even arranging white water rafting tours - all we had to do was get in the shuttle and the rest was done. The Dry Creek store is the perfect place to get a cup of coffee, ice cream bars for the kids, and the deli menu is great (we picked up a fishing license there, too)! Normally after a day of swimming in the local creeks, we curl up to s'mores by the fire, but on occasion, the kids can even pick out a movie from the front office and watch a dvd on the flat screen right in our cabin. The grounds are well maintained and the road around the park is perfect for our little ones to ride their bikes. There is a bit of poison oak in the area, so we always bring tecnu, but we've yet to come down with any. Bring plenty of sunscreen and insect repellent, too! We love this campground and look forward to many years of camping and summer fun there!]
