[103166599185987699398,100609922039538362661,4.0 stars. Best sleep I've had in a long time. Hampton Inns are often clean and updated, and this is no exception. The staff was all courteous and my room was quiet and clean. I requested a quiet room on the top floor away from the elevator, and couldn't even hear other folks. I'm usually very sensitive to noise, and there is no road noise here. The only downside is location--it's about 1.5 miles to downtown, but the drive is super easy. There are chain restaurants around here that will serve well enough, but I opted for a gourmet delivery service.]
