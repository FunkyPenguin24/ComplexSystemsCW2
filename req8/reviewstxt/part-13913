[111596642042647249966,100906050179697318520,extremely accommodating, reliable & very friendly! Working 13 hour shifts while having rescued a 6 week old puppy was only made possible because of Brett, Nick & Kristina. They were great about helping out or changing plans last minute, sent email and/or text updates and pictures of her and did an amazing job of wearing her puppy self out (which is not an easy task...) The logs they kept from each visit were hilarious and a highlight to come home to. They made me and my dog so comfortable and without worry or hesitation about her care or the care of my belongings. You won't be disappointed. I wish I could have them here in Charlotte--she misses her buddies :)]
