[113664898155757904207,100259818003251583591,Cerritos was the 3rd Hyundai dealership I visited, looking for a new Genesis. The first 2 dealerships, South Bay and Harbor, did not seem interested in selling me a car. One didn't even have a salesperson come out and greet me. I had to go to reception and ask for a salesperson. And the last one was not interested in negotiating with me, and allowed me to leave after talking with me for a matter of minutes. Maybe they didn't feel I was interested. Cerritos Hyundai had excellent service. Although our salesperson was rather new there, only 16 days in, he was very nice. I would say it helped him a lot that he didn't have to try to sell me the car, as I came with the intent of buying. On the other hand, David the Sales Manager was there trying to sell a car. He was more than willing to negotiate with me on my trade in (gave me higher than KBB Fair!!!) and give me the price I was looking for. Was there a little pressure to buy yesterday? Sure, that's their job... But they gave me my space and allowed me to return the next day with my wife, so she could test drive the car. They left us alone to talk after the test drive and then we were in and out of finance in less than 5 minutes! UNHEARD OF! I would definitely recommend Cerritos Hyundai to any prospective buyers. I would definitely look for David if you are looking to trade in a car. As for the dealership, bathrooms were very clean and the showroom was well kept. I would recommend a small popcorn machine for the kiddies!]
