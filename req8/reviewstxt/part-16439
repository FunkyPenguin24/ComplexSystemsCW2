[111366668563045351809,101043615860709725630,I have been going to Baus Family Dental for 20+ years and now bring my entire family. Each and every visit has been pleasant even when I needed extensive work. I can always sit back and relax. My kids ages 4, 6, 8 absolutely LOVE visiting the dentist....even request to go! Mariah, Lara, receptionist and all the assistants are great when working with my kids. Especially when it's my turn and the kids are running crazy throughout the office. It is a great family, friendly office with a well educated group of staff and offers a great variety of services. I highly recommend Baus Family Dental to anyone looking for a pleasant dental experience.]
