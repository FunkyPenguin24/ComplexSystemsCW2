[115059571522057191671,100395770676733408984,I work for The Hotel Telluride in Telluride, Colorado and received a call in May about a 4X4 trip that was being put together by Landrover, Flatirons for their client base. I can't say enough about what an enjoyment their entire team was to work with. I have to say, Fallon Price, their special events planner is a catch for any company. She is one of the most friendly, flexible, and professional individuals have planned an event with in a long time. Landrover Flatiron definitely values their customer relationships! Their attention to detail and pre-planning trips out to see us, gave me confidence that their top customers coming on this 4X4 experience were going to have an excellent time. The program went off flawlessly and there were lots of smiles, mud, and technical driving all weekend long!]
