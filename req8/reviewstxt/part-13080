[101912228553988792579,100861630437681872966,Wonderful experience! Love the new addition to Morningside! The staff was very friendly, and the atmosphere was very inviting. Our server most definitely made the experience top-notch! She was very helpful, friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu. The starters were VERY delicious, so make sure you don't overlook them! The beer is inexpensive, and they have housemade sodas. The pizzas have very tasty, unique ingredients. Very delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant, and I will most definitely be heading back to Timone's!]
