We show up on the first to get our keys (our families and friends had taken off work and rented trucks to move our things) and then all of the sudden we can't move in until the 7th. They edited our lease, and made us initial the change. We had already had the electricity turned on in the new place on the 1st, and rather than hassle with changing it back and forth between ourselves and the landlord, Scott Brown told us to take a certain amount off our rent that month, to compensate for the electricity we had paid for but not used. Every single month after that, they harassed us saying we were short on rent. We reminded them, the calls and emails continued. Upon moving out, our lease was to end on the 24th. So, I went to pick up the last of my things on the 24th, and the scumbags had already come and thrown away my stuff. About a dozen pairs of shoes, a 70-gallon bin of craft supplies, a hammock, a barbecue pit... The list continues. When I called to ask about where my missing things went, she said they had come to get them but that she would ask the maintenance team if maybe my things were still on a trailer somewhere. I waited on hold for 18 minutes, and then she hung up on me. DO NOT TRUST THESE PEOPLE TO KEEP THEIR WORD, OR TO RESPECT YOU, YOUR TIME, OR YOUR PROPERTY. They manage too many properties and do not have a smart enough team of employees to handle it.]
