[101537379729399129593,100998998761447639858,I went into the Florida iDoctor on Tampa Road in Oldsmar to have my iphone glass repaired. Their website said 15 minutes to fix your iPhone. I went in to learn the repair person was out for an hour. I left the phone and paid the bill of $130 dollars. I then went back an hour and a half later, and the repairman stated they did you not stock the iPhone 5 S glass cover and a return my money and sent me on my way. If you want to waste an hour of your life and not have your phone fixed, go to the Florida iDoctor. They call themselves doctors yet the woman did not diagnosis the needed cover correctly and the company couldn't fix the phone--not much of a doctor!]
