[107710654214258517211,101059669413595747512,I should have read the google reviews before going to Twisted Taco. Disappointing lunch. Service was not good. No refill on water or chips. Guacamole was too salty. Tacos were pathetic. Salad had only lettuce. Ordered $2 guacamole side and got charged $6.99. After paying the bill, I asked the server Schmitz why he charged more for guacomole. He was sarcastic and said that side order guacamole is not enough for 3 people. I told him that it is our choice because not all of us in the group like guacamole. He also asked me if I left a low tip. (I regret now that I had paid 22% tip which is way too much for the way he behaved).]
