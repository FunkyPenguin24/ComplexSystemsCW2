[115420873038297103385,100010913718562646059,The staff was polite, other than the dental assistant that knew me by name through a family member. The service was prompt and initially seemed adequate, until my filling popped out within the first week. The replacement didn't last longer than a month, and the remainder of fillings have either chipped or cracked. I have never returned. All billing was authorized beforehand through my insurance carrier, by their billing staff, and no extra charges were mentioned until I received a bill that was sent to collection, despite my complaint describing the inferior quality of service I received. I would not recommend this office.]
