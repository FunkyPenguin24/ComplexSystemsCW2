[102157977187034699274,101052325144942354515,Toro is a great South End restaurant, serving up Spanish-style tapas and great drinks! Their duck drumsticks and corn on the cob smothered in Manchego cheese is AWESOME. Communal style seating makes for a convival atmosphere, but it does get somewhat noisy on Fridays and Saturdays, and the no-reservation policy can be a bit of a drag.]
