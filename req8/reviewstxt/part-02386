[104760952958243689573,100281716233167981258,A fantastic pool, clean and well manned. The staff are very helpful. I use the pool for adult sessions and also take my 2 year old who loves it. Excellent changing rooms for family users with lots of safety equipment in there to help you get ready. The water is much warmer than most public baths and is comfortable for older and younger users. Although they do not have a cafe they have a good selection of vending machines with snack and drinks available. Highly recommended.]
