[106250274599792849651,100763179305868422147,I had grown very tired of the bland dreck sold by the big chain pizza places (PH, DomiNOs, Puking Johns, Not-So-Hungry-Now Howies...) so I changed it up and bought a pie from Leaning Tower. Best pizza I have had in a very long time. Normally I'll eat a couple pieces and take the rest to work the next day, but I ate half the pizza before I realized it and had the rest for dinner that same day. Fantastic food, a teeny-tiny bit more expensive (when you break down the comparisons) but you'll be getting QUALITY AND QUANTITY (this was a huge pizza!). Definitely worth revisiting again and again.]
