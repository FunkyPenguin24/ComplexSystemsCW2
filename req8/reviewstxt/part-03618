[104789714588326836845,100347550973227148597,At “Salvador Calvano Hair” in Phoenix, you will get an organic, natural haircut. I know I do. Salvador began cutting my hair in 2007, and I’ve been driving a hundred miles round-trip from Casa Grande ever since. He’s nursed my hair from medium length to long and, most recently, to a chin-length bob. The real test of a great haircut for me is to be able to wash and go without blow-dry, gel, mousse, hairspray, or any other control agent. My haircuts by Salvador inevitably ace the test. Rather than impose a particular style, he pays attention (let’s just say he listens) to hair. The result—whether long, medium, or short—is an excellent style that requires no fuss. Something Salvador does that few are confident—or talented—enough to do is cut hair while it is dry. In so doing, he sees hair as it truly is and can cut and shape accordingly. All wet hair looks pretty much the same, but all dry hair is individually unique. Salvador welcomes—indeed embraces—the challenge of working with hair the way it naturally presents. As for color, the answer is yes, but it is done masterfully, highlighting and enhancing what is already there—or should be. In fact, hair is never over-processed with product at Salvador’s salon. Instead, the goal is vibrant and vigorous hair that not only shines, but breathes. This approach is important at any age, but even more-so when one is over 60 as I am. My hair has never looked healthier than it does now. Salvador can—and has—styled international super-models, and he travels from Phoenix to New York to style hair during spring and fall Fashion Weeks. The bottom line, though, if you want a masterful haircut and/or color, you can get both at Salvador Calvano’s salon in Phoenix.]
