[100762291184150940391,100320302552490939841,Love the food, there is a dish with plantains that is excellent. Cuban sandwich is great too. The owner, Daniel, makes sure you feel welcomed and are really getting the best experience possible. They make great coffee drinks too with the espresso machine. Highly recommend for lunch. Affordable and authentic.]
