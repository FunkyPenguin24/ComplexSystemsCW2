[116788932112499678975,100212242657355266499,The Pumphouse Creamery is home to the best ice cream in the Twin Cities. Part of what makes it so good is the use of locally-sourced ingredients, from milk to cream to the fruits used in the various flavors. Be sure to stop by during the summer and try some of the delicious rhubarb ice cream, made from neighborhood rhubarb. The owner is gracious and friendly. Dogs are also welcome, which fits the ambiance of the area quite well. The location is just a couple blocks North of Minnehaha Parkway, so it makes a good stopover when on walks. Make a trip to the Pumphouse. It will be well worth your time.]
