[116907304569442984630,101047475627687941451,I used to love Wicked Weed Brewing great brews and decent atmosphere but that was all ruined tonight. Horrible service, unfriendly staff, bouncers making inappropriate gestures and kissey sounds at my girlfriend, and lets not forget the little red headed manager we made aware of the situation who did nothing! This is crap!!! Asheville is better than this over-hyped hipster joint! Want GREAT beer, service, and atmosphere visit Lexington Avenue Brewery or basically anywhere else in town!]
