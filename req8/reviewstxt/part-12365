[108348994066195779387,100821288659076872001,I've been to this clinic before many years ago when I had an older dachshund-terrier mix. I was always treated with masked condemnation and veiled contempt. I always felt like they were judging me and every word spoken by the staff was accusing me of something, though I am never sure of exactly what I've done to these people to earn their scorn. I often wondered if it was that they just didn't think there was any money in helping my mutt and so maybe they thought I was just wasting their time. Sadly, my dog died a few years ago, and I've had no pets in the interim until recently. Two days ago I took in a stray cat that looked like it had been through a really rough period of time. I took it to the clinic for an exam and shots and was treated no differently than I had ever been. They take your money but they don't really care about the animal or you, or what is in the best interest of either. I will give a much better review to Dr. Anderson, he seemed out of place in this environment. He seemed knowledgeable and friendly but more importantly it wasn't what he said or didn't say just that I never felt like he was judging me or that I had to read between the lines of his words. I don't remember every experience I've had with other doctors at the clinic in the past but I do believe that generally the doctors tend to treat you like a human being which is more than I can say for the rest of the staff. It is getting very difficult to find a single veterinary clinic that simply provides essential care for your animal's well-being at a fair price, and does so without making you feel like a pariah.]
