[109195340657765127293,101090538429591046071,I'm pretty much a regular there at this point. Over all the place is awesome with a wide variety of food. The staff are very friendly. I was reading some posts here and was thinking.....can any any place be 100% awesome all the time? No but they are normally more then fair if there is a problem. Keep up the awesome work and I will catch ya bar side if I'm there!!]
