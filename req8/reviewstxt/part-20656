[107095190013743785809,100094037878037081841,This was the most wonderful experience I could've had selling my car. I have had that car for 5 1/2 years; it was my first car. I would not have been comfortable parting with her to anyone who was less kind, HONEST, understanding, and approachable. Peter made the whole process enjoyable and gave the other car salvage people I've dealt with a serious run for their money; not only was I offered more money here and a year later than I asked previously, for an 11 year old car, but I was only told one price and explained why that price was what it was. He was straightforward, and truly the only person I would ever recommend bringing your used car to. Thanks Peter. :)]
