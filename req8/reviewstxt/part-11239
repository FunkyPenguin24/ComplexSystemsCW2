[100746129037168527168,100760672162884440109,The class i took was excellent but the financial aid department is garbage! they've sent my higher one card to an address which i never gave them and basically have me fending for myself with no type of help or services to correcting their mistakes. I'm frustrated dealing with a institution that does not want to help with their own faults and i have to buy books for my class. I am dropping myself from this school in total this week. Thanks LACC for nothing]
