[107854449404835692311,101176539721110204674,Filthy, horribly maintained hotel. Proximity to downtown is the only upside to staying here. The toilet ran all night, the light fixtures and outlets are falling out of the walls with exposed wiring. I got trapped in the elevator unable to exit on the 1st floor and had to take it to the basement and force the door open. Our "non-smoking room" smelled of cigarettes and mold. The owner clearly does not care about the cliental allowing the place to fall apart without investing in repairs and staff willing to clean to acceptable industry standards. Spend your money elsewhere and DO NOT STAY HERE.]
