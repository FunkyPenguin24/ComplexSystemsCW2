[100158298317660386674,100657540413893158481,I was at Hollywood 20 today, January 17th, to see the new Movie Zero Dark 30 at 12:10. Upon leaving the theater a little after 3 pm I was charged $3.00 for parking. There are signs everywhere that parking is free for movie goers but the boy in the booth refused my validated ticket and would not even look at me. I immediately called the manager of the theater who responded, "Are they doing that again?" This is the second time this has happened to me. The first time I can excuse as maybe a bad employee but the second? With a manager who doesn't even seem to care I have no choice but to go out of my way to avoid Hollywood 20 in Sarasota until something is done.]
