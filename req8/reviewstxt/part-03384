[100678087742803918226,100334069827386006867,Step back to a simpler time with an outstanding breakfast our lunch at Louisa's Place. This is not your "Chain Restaurant Experience". Limited seating but worth the wait. This is a true locals favorite. Family owned and operated. Make sure the kids color their place mat for the wall. If you're looking for the same restaurant you can find in any town, this place is not for you.]
