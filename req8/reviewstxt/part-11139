[106193941878604075155,100755552645444836229,Terrible! Absolutely terrible! They are a monopoly and have high rates that take advantage of Lubbock residents since there are no other competing companies. You will get what you deserve and I will be a part of the protest against this company. I keep my ac at 78-80 throughout the day hours, have washed 9 loads of laundry all month and open my windows for air often after turning the ac OFF! At night I turn the ac to 76 for 7 hours and it then goes back up to 79. The temperatures are cooler and my bill is over $200!]
