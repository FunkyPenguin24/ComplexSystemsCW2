[105353852245339211871,100958055142512978179,I wouldn't do business there at all if I were you. All the managers will do is back you into a corner and will hound you. I noticed when i got my new chrysler that the sticker price went up significantly from 27k to around 32k. Five grand is a lot of money and not something you can just throw away. I traded in my Eclipse towards this and its been over a month and im still getting notices from the bank saying i havent paid for the eclipse. They will make you continue paying for your old vehicle and your new one. You will not get to the payment you want and you will be treated like dirt while you are there. Stay clear of this place at all costs!]
