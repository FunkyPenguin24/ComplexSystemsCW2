[118067907826321903437,100311220808028636784,My husband and I brought our 2008 Toyota Tundra in to Heartland after seeing the dreaded Check engine light come on. We made the hour plus drive down to the dealership and I couldn't have been more pleased that we did. Upon arrival the Assistant Service Manager, Scott Moritz was on it. Everyone has these suspicions that working with a dealership's service department is going to cost you time, money and that the employees can often be rude or arrogant. That couldn't be further from the truth at Heartland. Their expertise resulted in less man hours on the job costing less money and time. Scott was a pleasure to work with, easily reachable and I felt like getting to the bottom of our problem was his number one concern. He is comfortable, confident and qualified, easily identifying problems with our vehicle that took our mechanic weeks to locate. What more could you ask for? This service department has the feel of your local shop where they want to get to know you and your vehicle. I highly recommend them and Scott, together they make a great team.]
