[117460408485737108130,100135882252166992155,Linda....my name is Jill and I am the owner of Serenity. I was suprised to hear your negative feedback. At Serenity, we have very talented stylists who all do an amazing job. I looked in our clients list and there is no Linda Trafice in our database. Anyhow I see your a world traveler being to London, Missouri & Raleigh all in the past month. I see that you have had bad experiences in all these locations. If your are in the area again I would be more than happy to cut your hair myself for free. As far as the price, we charge $35 for a wash, cut & style which is very competitive for our area.]
