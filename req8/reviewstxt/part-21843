[105399187727227434346,100158632208768777922,I walked into the dealership with 15,000 in cash for a deposit on a Honda Fit for my daughter. I had just gotten out of work so I threw on a polo shirt and went with her, when I arrived no one greeted me not that I need greeting and finally a salesman came over and started to speak to me in Spanish. My Spanish isn't very good but he would not speak English. I asked him about seeing the vehicle in teal and he said yes and after just watching him smile and not understanding me that I really wanted to see the vehicle, my daughter walked out. Two days later I purchased the vehicle at Brickell Honda with problems at all. lesson learned, speak English and listen to the customer....]
