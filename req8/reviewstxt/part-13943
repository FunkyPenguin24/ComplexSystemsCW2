[104386825380905221113,100908037015102001884,Terry Mykins did an excellent job as salesman. Even though I took a month to complete my decision and looked at many dealers and vehicles, I settled on a truck Terry showed me. He left occasional follow up messages but wasn't annoying. When I arrived to negotiate the sale, he was helpful and direct. He has followed up after the sale, too. Overall super job. The bad experience was with the business manager, Joe. He arranged financing which was great. However, he would only show monthly payments tied to extended warranty programs. I had to force him to show me the true monthly payment. His programs ranged from an extra $25 to $100/ month. He justified extended warranties on the amount of electronic systems in the truck, how some would fail, in turn causing others to fail and their costly service rates. So, I should buy an extended warranty because of the unreliable electronics, poor design and high price of their service? He's now raised doubts of whether I've made a wise choice in buying a Ram 1500. I didn't do any of the extended warranty programs. They detailed the truck and it looks really good. I've only driven about 200 miles but it runs great and I'm getting good mileage, as good as advertised, even with the AC on. I'm pleased with the truck and my relationship with Terry. I recommend Terry to anyone looking to buy a truck.]
