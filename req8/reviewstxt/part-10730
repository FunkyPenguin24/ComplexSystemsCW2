[104032591547790043943,100732941395867533682,At this stage of the game for our home loan, this has been a fairly nightmare'ish experience. We have had several questions for our loan officer, however, they feel that our questions must not be terribly important since it has been 9 days since we have had any communication from them. We have submitted paperwork and even walked in to the bank but they were unavailable. We will be going in tomorrow and speaking to the branch manager.]
