[113546289015124998051,100422415157435642837,Excellent customer service!! I came in for repairs on my truck shell (I didn't know what brand it was and there was no brand markings anywhere on it), the guy who helped me out was great. He was able to match me up with a glass door hatch and got me back on the road quickly. Having a locking shell is very important and after making some phone calls, I didn't think I would be able to replace just the glass - everyone else wanted to sell me a whole new truck shell!]
