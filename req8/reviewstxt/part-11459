[101458022869986839591,100771510775900779204,The beef (and beef with sausage) sandwiches here are absolutely AMAZING. Get it wet with the peppers and you won't regret it. Probably the best sandwich I have eaten in Grand Rapids area. Worth the trip. I can't tell you how much you need to eat this place's food.]
