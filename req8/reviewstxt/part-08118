[111455258559941334531,100593858576228594346,I was in for service with my 2005 ML 350 and had the pleasure to meet Mirela Cristache, a sales rep. that greeted me and asked me if i was all set and offered me coffee. She asked what kind of vehicle I am driving and offered to show me the new models that are out . I love my car and did not think about getting a new vehicle but her customer service skills were so persuasive where she got me interested. I told her if and when I will be in the market I will make sure to contact her. Also any friends and family that are thinking about getting a new Mercedes will go see her !!! Thank you Mirela !!!]
