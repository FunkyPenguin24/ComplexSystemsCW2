[103940822989852839633,101047643725019612979,DO NOT buy a vehicle from these horrible people. First off, their cars are pieces of crap. I was scammed into buying what looked like a decent car on the outside, but what turned out to be a lemon (had to invest in many repairs costing a couple thousand dollars when all was said and done). THEN when I had just over $700 left on the loan, I ran into some financial problems (I was laid off). I spoke to them when I made a payment earlier this month and told them I expected my tax refund by the 20th and I would pay off the loan at that time not being able to make any further payments until then (seriously they couldn't wait 20 days for the entire balance on the loan!!??). They chose instead to continue to harass me (over $200!) and then repo'ed the vehicle. NOW they want me to pay not just the $700+ left on the loan, but an additional $400+ for towing/storage. EVEN though they do the towing themselves and I live 3 minutes from them. They are heartless, unforgiving and will NOT work with you under any circumstances. NOT worth the heartache and stress...and their cars are CRAP!!!]
