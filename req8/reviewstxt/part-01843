[104207241401988776563,100254626193274056666,Kenny's is a really fun place with great food, but you have to like the noise level amp'ed up a little. I went last night and really enjoyed the blue cheese bacon burger. Cooked to perfection and just a really good flavor. I am sorry I ordered the stuffed jalapeno's and not the cheese fries. But that is why they make weekends. Hope you enjoy the food.]
