[113793437538690037253,100442975783065834708,I'm Hispanic with thick curly hair, it's difficult for me to find anyone who can cut and style my hair to compliment my face and in the style that's easy for me to manage. I had an appointment with Kimora who was on time and fantastic. She immediately asked what I was hoping to do and understood my hair and texture. I had the most wonderful shampoo ever! The woman (who I sadly don't recall her name) washed my hair but before that, she gave me a wonderful scalp massage. Kimora immediately understood what I wanted to do with my hair and the challenges with the particular hairstyle and made it work. She even gave me tips on how to blow dry my hair! It was wonderful, lively and fun (I really never have said that about a hair salon) and I will definitely be returning.]
