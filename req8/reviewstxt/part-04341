[101364864256798167798,100389385352486129001,My Wife and a few friends stopped by and met with Charlie. I am very impressed with how warm and welcoming he was to our party (9 of us in total) rolling up on him in our ostentatious stretch hummer like a bachelor party from hell. Not only were we a large group in an absurdly over sized gaudy limo, we were a 1/2 hour late for our appointment and 5/9th's of our group needed to use the restroom as soon as we arrived... (The limo came stocked with cheap champagne, and we brought a bottle or two of our own which was slightly better, but gone nonetheless by the time we arrived at Charlie's a half hour late at 11:30 in the morning.. With a big warm smile and firm handshake, we used the restroom and then sampled the absolutely best wine we had the joy of experiencing in two full days of touring the valleys. the simple fact that he opened one of his 2007 Cooks Flat Reserve for us to sample is a testament to his generosity and confidence in his wine. It is simply amazing. He did not have to do that for our party. We were already blown away. A bit too pricey for me to get a case, I am however, delighted to purchase a full case of his Riesling, and if you know whats good, you will get some too, before its all gone. Thanks Charlie! we all enjoyed your presentation very much, and I am sure we will back! Robert, Melissa, Liat, Ben, Meagan, Nick, Robin, Mark and Christa]
