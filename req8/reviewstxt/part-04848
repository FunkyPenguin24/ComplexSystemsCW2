[104835535616944902823,100415993236774229871,I found my experience at Pell City's RadioShack to be very shocking! I thought that because of the ages of the employee's I would not get very much information on the products I was looking to buy. I found that the 2 young females were very helpful. They not only new what I was looking for but had information to help me get the best out of the product's I was buying & even one I already had. Even though one of the items I wanted was out they had another one that was the exact product just a different style which I was ok with going ahead and purchasing. Thanks girls for such great work.]
