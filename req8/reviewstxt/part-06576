[118334760248113676315,100508916533573369634,My boyfriend and I stayed here for a couple weeks for a friends wedding. Close to Yokohama and lots of interesting shops. Sure the rooms are small, but for the $40 we spent it was totally worth it, and cozy! There was a TV to watch the local channels, air conditioning and a mini fridge in the room. It was nice to have the kitchen when we wanted to make small meals (but to be honest, we mostly ate out or went to the Family Mart up the street for snacks) My tips: don't use the dryer. I spent 700+ yen to realize why everyone just hangs up their laundry on the top floor by the garden. And ask for European pillows. The pillows that come in the room are the small bean types for people that sleep on their backs which I'm not used to. Trying to use the shower wasn't too bad, just write your room number on the whiteboard to claim the next spot if it's busy. But we only had to do that once. Remember to pack light! As there isn't a lot of space in your room. Oh, there's also a small supermarket just past the train station, it's easy to miss, but it was nice to know it was there. Overall, it was a excellent experience. For westerners like us, it was a real culture shock. But I loved it and would stay here again.]
