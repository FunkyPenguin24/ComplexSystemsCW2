[103516204483251350266,100543774812948535532,The food is good, American style Mexican at reasonable prices. I prefer to order ceviche, which isn't on the menu, but it is made fresh, takes about twenty minutes to prepare but is worth the wait. Their happy hour specials are cheap! The staff is great from the owner on down. My favorite Mexican restaurant in Woodinville.]
