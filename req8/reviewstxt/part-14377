[115843559749056743293,100933828585364561749,BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT BUYING USED CARS HERE! My daughter bought a car last year from them. One year later, she returned to their service department for a checkup (they wanted $100 for this) and was told she'd need to spend 3k on 4 new tires, an alignment and a new rack and pinion steering gear box. She was told that the car was unsafe to drive. The car had been driven only 13k over the last 12 months and was sold with "new tires." She walked out and got a 2nd opinion, whereupon she was told that the car needed only 2 new tires, it was safe to drive, and the total repair cost would be $1300, and no new rack/pinion needed. Clearly this was a case of Braman Honda taking advantage of a young 20-something woman, where they thought they could make a buck (or 3k in this case) and get away with it. CAR BUYER BEWARE.]
