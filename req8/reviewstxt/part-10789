[111022377512845421423,100735792254562623675,Don Toston is just a block away from our business and they have become our go-to spot for lunch. Their home-cooked-style food hits that spot but doesn't break the bank. Just like mine, this business is a family-run operation. Richard and his team are great people and have been a great addition to the neighborhood. I encourage all our customers to cross the street - over to Don Toston - if they're hungry. Never has anyone come back disappointed.]
