[110599231893025502951,101046684107615546394,Our 2 pups have boarded there twice (for 3+days) and each time we've had great, attentive and considerate folks taking care of them. The option for suites with windows is great. Any time I call to check up on them I get someone who knows our pups and tells me how they're doing and who they're playing with and seem to have a genuine care for all the dogs. We spent quite a bit of time researching places and we're so glad we found Riverwalk.]
