[102203092406069875914,100741654865614117668,My husband and I always go to 3D's for our food. We've tried other Jamaican Restaurants in and out of our neighborhood and in Atlanta, GA, but the food was not as good as 3D's. Also, other Jamaican Restaurants seem to run out of food after 6:00 pm. Even though I'm "Jamerican," 3D's always treat me well...oh...they ALWAYS have sweet plantains...a pre-requisite for me.]
