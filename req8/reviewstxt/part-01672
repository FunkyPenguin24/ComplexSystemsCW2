[107333676901614405981,100246200402026792944,Contacted various Ford dealers through internet. Only Anton and Sea Breeze were willing to answer all of my questions, and did so in very timely fashion and very pleasantly. I was treated very fairly and loved their family dealership atmosphere. They were easy to negotiate with and my wife and I left there feeling very satisfied in the deal we got plus the value of our trade-in. I would highly recommend that anyone looking for a Ford contact them.]
