[111691041762958944475,100629860893972165696,Their general attitude is like it or lump it. No customer service. I did not get the truck that I had wanted. I either accepted what they had or got nothing. Yes, my back was against the wall and I took it. But never again!!!! Also, be careful of their hours. There is NO after hour parking. And if your a woman on her own, their attitude is "Oh well!" You are not able to talk to a manager. The number given to me took me to their overall number for Atlanta.]
