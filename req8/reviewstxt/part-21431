[108717102503638925774,100136623553109621528,Service department is so frustrating. Get ready to wait. Scheduled appointment 3 wks in advance to have a routine seat belt recall done only to have them tell me they had to order the part. Came in a second time to find they had over-booked themselves, which meant I had to wait over 2 hours for a 45min service. So frustrating.]
