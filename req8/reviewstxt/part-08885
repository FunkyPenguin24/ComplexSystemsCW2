[109922226943077912391,100632236288682926589,I was first introduced to Brett Shopsin in 2007 while shopping for a new car. I eventually bought a 2008 BMW 328i Coupe. Brett and the entire staff were excellent. In October of 2012, I traded my 328i on a X1 x35i. My new X1 arrived in December and I really liked the car. Again, Brett and the entire staff were great. Soon after I developed a serious problem with the X1. I had an engine failure after 800 miles. I was upset and concerned about having to have the engine replaced. I wanted a new car. To my pleasant surprise, they agreed. I took delivery on my new X1 on March 28, 2013. Brett, Jimmy Anderson, and John Hall were great not only in getting me a new vehicle, but in their support of the customer (me). I have nothing but good things to say about the Checkered Flag BMW organization. From Sales to Service to Management, Their Top Notch. They have certainly made a lifelong customer out of me.]
