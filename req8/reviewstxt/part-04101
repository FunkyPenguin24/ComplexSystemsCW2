[108346172980093636042,100375161725871928169,Glenn Helmstetter was awesome! He was very helpful and nice first thing in the morning which is always a plus. He even bought me the filters I needed replaced to actually SHOW me how dirty they were. Honesty is always a plus with me. I will ask for Glenn from now on. Thanks guys :)]
