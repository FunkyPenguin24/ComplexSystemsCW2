[101677219761538218785,100776352228476882656,My wife and I were driving up to 280 from Heardmont Park and decided that we really wanted some Daylight Donuts, as we don't get them often due to them being on the other side of town (we live in Hoover). I called them around 12:55, only to have one of the workers that was on duty tell me that they were about to close. I sighed and thanked her for the information, but before I hung up, she told me that if we hurried we could still get some before she closed. She stayed open for us (we finally got there at 1:08) and we were able to get our donut fix. I didn't get her name, but whoever was working on 5/19 at closing time was awesome!]
