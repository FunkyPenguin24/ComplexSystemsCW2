[117919584656578846549,100370825868639980780,Service and atmosphere is great here. Though it does get annoying when i have fireworks in my face 10 times throughout the hour that im there. I also wonder about their cooking ability in some dishes. For example , every time i have gotten the vodka riggies(which has been atleast 5 times hoping it gets done right) it tastes just like they poured it into the dish and never cooked the vodka into the sauce. I wanna taste flavor in my pasta not have a shot of it. Other dishes there though are amazing.]
