[116917344758360545421,100990409427859436256,This place is amazing, especially the service. I only go for lunch. First of all the food is cheap - the five dollar lunch is back! Second you can order online and it's ready when you get there. Third the service is great. Once our order got lost and they fixed it in five minutes and our lunch was free for me and my friends even though they only screwed up one order. One note: there is not really seating inside, just 3 tables, so get take out.]
