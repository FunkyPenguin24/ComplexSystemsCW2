[101409538355623938701,100843284818839651134,First time I have stayed in a hotel with no air conditioning - at least during "heater season" in which the thermostat (which seemed like a nice touch at first) was really only a heater. The room never got below 70, when I called to inquire they said, "turn off the thermostat, that is the best you can do. Sorry your room is too hot." We were here with a group for an in-hotel function. Over the 3 days we were here, we were served burnt popcorn (come now, they really couldn't just dump it and make another batch, how cheap); cookies made with a bad recipe that came out looking like cupcakes and tasted horrible; and during a lunch one day, the bread for sandwiches was frozen solid. When the first batch ran out, the tray was left empty (despite many people still in line), when the server finally brought out another loaf, he said, "I was hoping not to have to open another bag," as if the cost of the bread came out of his paycheck. By the way, it was frozen also. One of my favorite little things about staying in a hotel is cranking the A/C and getting under many covers, as I write this, I'm laying in bed with all the covers off, the room very humid and stale and no A/C as even an option. Oh and if you were wondering, this is a "Holidome" with no access to exterior windows. UPDATE: Just got off the phone with the desk again. There is nothing we can do, "some of our rooms are too hot, some too cold." Nice. Nice hotel, just resigned to the fact that the climate in their rooms is crap. Maybe they should work on that. In the meantime, stay in a modern hotel that actually has A/C.]
