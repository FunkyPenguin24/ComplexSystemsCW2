[104061113477641326602,100107630622873195688,I needed several stumps removed in my front yard and I called VA Contracting. I received a free estimate the very next day and the job was fairly priced. They were able to do the job quickly without any hassles. All the employees were very polite and professional. I would definitely use them again. I highly recommend VA Contracting if you are in need of any type of tree service.]
