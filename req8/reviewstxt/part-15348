[116814544384816580568,100984565042428581927,I have used this location many many times for Mac repairs for my clients. Techs are friendly and knowledgable. It is way more convenient than the apple store and I never have to wait to check anything in. You can make an appt with the apple store and still wait for an hour or more to be seen. I highly recommend this store. It sure saves me a lot of time to not have to deal with Apple directly.]
