[116879744137825021853,101053581157719454186,Saying this school altered my life is not making a overly bold statement. I had held an undergraduate degree in painting from a state university, but this was not enough for me to secure a "creative" job other than teaching in public schools (BTW, these folks are truly underpaid and under-appreciated). When I heard about a school in Raleigh that offered training in computer arts I jumped at the opportunity to learn more. Before I completed my training, I was already working for a local computer game company. Ever since I have worked in the field as a Concept Artist, Lead Artist, Art Director, and Art Manager.]
