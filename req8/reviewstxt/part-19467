[113858287515689607080,100030985362251967903,I just had my Chris King hub serviced by Bala at Cycevolution and converted front and rear to thru axles, so pretty much brand new. Saw the tool with my own eyes. They roll even smoother and quieter. I also had my bike completely redone with new parts and boy what a difference especially in the mechanics of the bike. Everything feels better than when I first got my bike. If I can't work on it, Cyclevolution is the only one touching my babies. Highly recommended, great service, a one on one experience.]
