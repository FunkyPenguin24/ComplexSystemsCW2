[101339123023641049801,100606568347804913959,Absolutely awesome doctor, and I don't say this lightly. I have been to many eye doctors over the years, and this is the first time I've actually been fitted with the correct contact lens and can see wonderfully with them! I adore Dr. Dornic, and all of his staff is very kind, courteous and helpful. I could not be happier all the way around, and don't know what I will do when we have to leave this area. Don't believe all the hype on the commericals from other doctors in this area, Dr Dornic is an amazing doctor, and in my opinion, and based on everything I've heard from others who have gone to other eye offices, he IS the best eye practitioner in the Raleigh, Durham, Cary area.]
