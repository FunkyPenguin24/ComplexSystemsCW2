[109441172569495539900,100947087637552503553,We booked the Chalet Rainbow's End for a Couple Retreat (4 couples). The house was amazing, and the staff at Chalet Village was superb. The 2 recommendations I would make to the owners would be to upgrade the TV's to larger screens especially in the bedrooms. For someone who likes to fall asleep watching TV, the TV in the bedroom was hard to see. Also, the grill outside was very small and hard to fit 8 steaks! I would recommend this Chalet and Chalet Village properties to anyone visitng Gatlinburg, TN.]
