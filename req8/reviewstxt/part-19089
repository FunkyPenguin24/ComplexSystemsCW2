[103361868857831658552,100010414586308211790,The food was okay but the chicken nuggets were terrible. The waitress took my cup to refill it along with several other cups and when she gave me my cup back, it wasn't my cup. It was white and mine was red. But...I stuck a straw in it and drank it all up. The meal was 12.75. Kinda high I think for the food but most of it tasted fine]
