[109966428249477668971,100179390467566836245,In simple terms, this dealer ship was great to my dad and I! I bought a used 07 Chevy Tahoe. We inspected this thing like no tomorrow, of course there was some things I would want to be fixed in order for me to buy it. Tommy Haynes was the one helping us with the sale and he was great, he's your typical sales guy! We addressed what we wanted done and he got them done. I decided after seeing the work done, this is the car I wanted, so we bought it. Financing was laid out very clearly, which I like. So far, the vehicle is GREAT! If I ever decide to buy another car, I will be going back to Auto Nation Ford Katy.]
