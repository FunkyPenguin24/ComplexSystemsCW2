[115068641072392036074,100079544988013961256,I like to write these reviews as soon as I leave a place - so here goes. Took the a while to get our drinks ( water and a diet coke) then we had to ASK the server for bread after being there for about 20 min. Appetizers were ok. We ordered a sushi roll and some shrimp that was tossed in spicy mayo. We ordered the Porterhouse for 2 as our entree, which is where the disappointment really came in. The thing look like an over grilled London broil, had no seasoning and was over-cooked from our specification of medium- rare. Burnt on the outside, and chewy texture to the meat. Then they slice it before they serve it, but they didn't let it rest enough and all the juice ran out - dry dry dry! We live in the neighborhood, and would give them another chance, but not on a $70 steak!]
