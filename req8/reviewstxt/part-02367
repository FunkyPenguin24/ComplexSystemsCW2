[109948974283480721031,100280880659425053407,I have been going to Precision Auto Tech for several years now! Nick and his techs are awesome at dignosing a problem and fixing it, for a great price. I refus to take my vehicles anywhere else because I know for a fact that I can trust Nick and his work!! I personally served with Nick and he is one of the most honest people I know and it shows in his ownership and dedication to his customers. Nick has even made a house call, because my husband was away at school and was stuck at home with my kids! There's no one that can compare, price, quality work, honesty and customer service!! When trading in my vehicle, Nick was the only person I called to get his opinion on what type of vehicle to get for what was best suited for me and my family!]
