[100497052697528756527,100994034764013881590,Old school neighborhood bar with good food. Pizza is good but you need to order extra cheese on it as they don't really use enough cheese for our taste. The wings are awesome here! I have never seen my kids clean the bones like they do when we get them from Tim's! The garlic hot are our favs.]
