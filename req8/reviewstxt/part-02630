[101843251411755701879,100294704727496372703,The people working in the service department do not know what they are doing nor are they "reasonable" with service prices. I'm new to the area and took my truck in for a checkup. I was told that my wheel bearings needed to be immediately replaced and it wasn't safe to drive the way it was. I took my truck to 2 other shops for other estimates and both told me that my wheel bearings were in great shape, but that I need =ed to have my upper control arms replaced and a lower right ball joint. Also the upper control arms were not even bolted in properly. Two shops told me that, but Chevy didn't even notice that something was not installed properly. Way to go people! Never again will I waste a penny with you!]
