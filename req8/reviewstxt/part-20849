[103393037409604673531,100105205914982942791,They have an awesome shop with an open air showroom that is hip but not pretentious. Feels like a spot you want to hang out in for a few hours. I came in with one of their Rambler packs that I had bought at a dealer. It had a bit of missed stitching on one of the zippers, and Morgan, the awesome guy helping me, immediately offered to replace it with a brand new bag. No receipt, no questions. They even let me pay the difference to trade up to the limited edition version of the bag, which I had been kicking myself for not buying in the first place. The bag is amazing, the service was excellent, and I walked out convinced that Mission Workshop is one of the best brands out there.]
