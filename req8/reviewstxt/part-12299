[114795224008767449383,100817552508267587954,My wife and I stayed here for a late winter weekend getaway and had a wonderful time. The proprietors made us feel at home while still affording us a lot of privacy. The room was cozy and comfortable, and in-room spa lived was the best I've every seen--very plush accommodations with nice little extras. Breakfast was delicious, and the inn even provided discounts to local restaurants. We are planning our next trip here right now. Can't wait for our next visit!]
