[110740582427070845950,100403979030962751861,This restaurant is definitely off the beaten path for most tourists, although it's easily walked from the center of Prague. The food here is traditional--mostly Czech with some Slovak and Hungarian specials as well. Our meal was excellent; the atmosphere was quiet, cozy and pleasant; and the service was very good. If you like Central European food, you'll enjoy Posezeni U Chiriny. What you find in the center of Prague in the tourist areas is generally not good Czech food. This is! Here's a small neighborhood restaurant in the best sense of the term.]
