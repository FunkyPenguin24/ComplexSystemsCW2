[104704300551249172881,101064892162319354171,Nasty! Nasty people and the food was late to come out and guess what...cold when it did. Some guy claiming to be the manager was racist and abrasive. You would think that customer service would be a priority. It's more like we represent more work they have to deal with by us being there.. Won't be back. If you require a nice atmosphere......stay clear of this place.]
