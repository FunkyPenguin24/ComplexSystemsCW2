[100316856413702138069,100332692784978285275,Something stinks here. My car is fairly new and after my regular AAA location has been keeping it maintained very regularly. I decided to save some travel time and go to this closer location for a state inspection. An hour and a half later I ask why this is taking so long to be told that my inspection failed and my car needs repairs. I can't know for certain exactly what happened, but my instincts are usually right on the money and I got the feeling something was not right. I'm taking it to my regular location to find out if they agree that my fairly new car should fail inspection. Doesn't make sense, especially when it has been driving well with no issues.]
