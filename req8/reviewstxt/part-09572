[108339803671003661543,100670235697181043669,I have never received more professional, dedicated training since I began with United Studions. Sensei Tyler Martin has been a tremendous influence not only in my martial arts, but in my life. I have reached new levels of confidence, I have learned to focus my energy in new and positive ways that will benefit me throughout my life. Sensei Nancy inspires me to always push forward, to reach further each day more than the one that came before it. I look forward to continuing my training with Sensei Tyler and Sensei Nancy because I know how much better my life has become because they are a part of it.]
