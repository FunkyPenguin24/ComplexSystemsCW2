[112248849877332465862,100177449416402564642,They advertised a car with 35 miles and said it was new. It had 500 miles when we went to look and they told me it was just test drives. I repeatedly asked if it had been registered before and was told No, that would be illegal to sell it as new if it was preregistered. I bought it and guess what, yep its used. 4 months later I still do not have the title and at first I got excuses, now nothing. They think I am going away. Big mistake there.]
