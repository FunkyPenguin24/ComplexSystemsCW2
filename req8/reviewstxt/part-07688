[104513133631299712335,100570209456279357759,After purchasing my vehicle at Coastal Nissan I decided to use their service department for all work needed. The service director Matthew Kittredge is very friendly and knowledgeable. His staff as always willing to answer any questions I have and their work is excellent. I would highly recommend Coastal Nissan for your next repair or routine maintenance. Excellent service, friendly atmosphere, and good prices.... Why go anywhere else?]
