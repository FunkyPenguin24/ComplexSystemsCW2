[117705398545133507314,100268160889072102762,I ordered a chicken fajita salad online, and after an hour and ten minutes of waiting, they brought me a greek salad. I asked what SHOULD be on the chicken fajita salad (because they have very few menu descriptions), and they said it was the same as the greek salad without feta cheese, which doesn't sound like a chicken fajita salad to me. Then I asked to order something different, but they wouldn't throw in anything extra for their mistake. The delivery driver wouldn't even get out of the car (and didn't apologize) when he returned. Cheesesteak barely had any cheese on it. Fries are good. TL;DR: food is mediocre, customer service sucks.]
