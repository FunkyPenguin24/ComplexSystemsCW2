[113091576771777414395,100368832386686998166,Perhaps being a bit above itself to call it a Gastropub, but definitely trying - which can only be encouraged in the area. Manages admirably to define country pub for regulars with separate dining area(s) where individual tastes are catered for. Staff are friendly when one can get their attention and this is perhaps the crucial point of enjoyment - SAY "I'd like my vegetables steamed and a bit al dente" and they came that way - on a previous visit I'd been sad to be given (in my opinion) completely overcooked vegetables - and I'd complained - only to be told that "that was how most people liked them, why didn't you say?" Staff are good and will accommodate most requests - but only if asked - after asking it's never a problem, but one does need to actually say something.]
