[117001203552431709695,100200488691985456099,Amanda Reid and Liat Colantonio were the two most unprofessional people I've ever met. Not only did Amanda say she hated her job while at the viewing. I had to check in 2 times to see what was going on with my application. Only to learn that my application was denied. I was blatantly ignored asking for a reason on why the application was denied. And the two didn't even seem to care about a possible tenant. I've just never felt so disregarded as a human being. Beautiful building and room, just awful management. DO NOT RENT HERE]
