[102762053154920938788,100343968397058791773,I had the lovely Groupon experience as well. Although I was charged an additional $45 dollars. I was told the Groupon covered one bowl of color and each additional bowl was $15 (Which was not published in the fine print). I was told 3 bowls should cover my hair. I wasn't real happy about it, but I thought $50 for the Groupon plus an extra $30...eh not happy but its a little too late once your in the chair. Although the haircut and color was nice. I see no "deal" in paying $95. You got me in the door and then made me pay MORE than I normally do. Wonder why people didn't make an appointment for a 2nd time??? Cause Single moms need to budget and the old Bait and Switch can only work once before people learn their lessons.]
