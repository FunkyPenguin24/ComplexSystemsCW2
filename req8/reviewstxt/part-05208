[114796861849233721232,100435458501098403990,Been eating here since the 80's. Its worth the drive from the Brownsville to Calumet City. The edges of the burgers are crispy / salty. I love it!!! Must have mayo with it though. Try grilled unions, bacon, ketchup, mustard and mayo. Sometimes crappy tomatoes/lettuce can ruin an expensive burger like "Schoop's" burgers, I don't gamble when I go there. I recommend going ghetto with no veggies. Try putting ketchup on your plate and dunking the burger instead putting the ketchup on the burger and getting your hands all nasty.]
