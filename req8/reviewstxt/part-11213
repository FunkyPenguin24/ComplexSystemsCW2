[100880654765680899884,100759056087385006810,Used to go there almost once a week when I was a kid. Food passable for diner fare. I don't think it's had a major renovation or redecoration since before I was born - which is to say over 30 years and the quality of the tables and chairs show it. Despite nostalgia of my youth these days the owners are so openly political that I can't support the business with my money. For what it's worth I think enough people in our small town share my view that it went from packed at dinnertime to a ghost town.]
