[105683914784456567061,100776787371636632534,I love the doctor's they are great, but the staff need to know more about the HIPAA Law. Specially if you're an office manager. I sent my husband, my son step-father, with a notarized letter to an appointment with my son. The office manager turned him away because he wasn't the father of my son and didn't even want to see the notarized letter. I came in the next morning and she tells me I broke HIPAA Law. I was like what?!?!? I don't work here so how did I break HIPAA Law and I sent a notarized letter!! Who does that?!?!? Then I call Diana her manager on Oct 2012 to let her know what going on with her staff, have yet to her back from her and we are in March 2013. Oh when you walk in the person in the front always as a face like they don't even want to be there.]
