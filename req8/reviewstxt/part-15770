[104409710915429108975,101008389472979037043,Walking around downtown just stopped in to look at the menu to see if it fit our hunger and we decided to sit down. Their special was a chile verde and it was excellent, just like my great grandma used to make it. The other item ordered was a fish and chips and it was very good. Also since we did come in the gave us a meatball appetizer for free and that was very tasty as well. The only thing I did not like was that their selection of beer was limited to light beers like lagers and such. But other then that it a place that I will continue to go.]
