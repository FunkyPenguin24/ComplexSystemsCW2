[111113597198760366494,101166247949421473643,Horrible. Do not waste your time. The sales associate set up a time for me to come see the vehicle. I took the day off of work and drove 1.5 hours all the way to see the vehicle and it was not there. And they tried to show me a different vehicle- it had coffee spilled all over the steering wheel and the door speakers. The console had crumbs in it. Totally unprofessional and just a horrible experience. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!]
