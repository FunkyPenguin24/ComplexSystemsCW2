[110054768497998332116,100842349716402468054,Currently going out of business and it's very apparent why. The owner told me to come back multiple times claiming the prices would be lower on throw pillows... I've come back multiple times for throw pillows that were said to be reduced, and the throw pillows are the same price. After asking for a lower price on a pillow I would use to sit on (I have people over and a small place so no room for chairs), the assistant offered to reduce 2. Then her boss walked in (the one who kept telling me to come back, or the owner) and caught her assistant ringing me up for a much lower price than what was written on the pillows. SO, the assistant lashes out on me and the owner calls me a liar? I understand that they're "down" pillows, but a. you told me to come back for lower prices that are not there, b. you called me a liar when I told you that you told me to come back for lower prices that are not there, c. the assistant explained that a wholesale store would be buying them for a cheaper price than marked and would then sell them for a higher price (so that's why she kindly marked them down for me), and d. they yelled very rude comments while I bagged my 2 properly reduced throw pillows and as I left the store. So for a higher tax receipt to donate or sell products to a wholesale store, Oysterbed employees compromise their customer service and integrity. Yes, it's very, very apparent why their business is closing.]
