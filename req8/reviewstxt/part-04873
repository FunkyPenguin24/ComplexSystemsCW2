[102287610443895371807,100417167358606949175,Cornerstone Chevrolet is a great dealership for all of my vehicle needs, whether it be service or in the sales department. Even though I live in St. Cloud because of the treatment I received when I stopped at Cornerstone to have a tire fixed. The professionalism as well as going to work on my vehicle right away. I was in and out in less than 30 minutes. Since that experience I have gone to Cornerstone for a vehicle and all of my service work. Even though it is 20 miles away from my home. Thank you Cornerstone Chevrolet for all that you do for me and my family. Ron Denny]
