[109503027794352522329,100889591151607927529,Agave is one of my favorite places to eat. The first thing you notice when you walk in the door is the amazing smell of fire grilled meat. The atmosphere and decor set the vibe perfectly. Rustic beams, rich earth tones, and over-sized booths. You can have one of over 200 kinds of tequila or any of the multitude of margarita flavors in addition to a full bar. Be sure to order the table-side prepared GUACAMOLE. They make it precisely to your liking. It pairs well with the smoky, home-made salsa and chips which come free with your meal. If you come during happy hour and sit at the bar, there are great deals on appetizers and drinks. Finally, save room for the tres leches, which is the best I've ever had. If you love Agave as much as me, be sure to ask for their Amigo card. I recently earned a free Sunday brunch for two (value about $50). Reservations are not usually needed, but during the winter months when Naples population doubles, you should put one in. On a side note, the parking is abundant, close, and free.]
