[105301240131169289226,100172671268763670160,I bought a 2013 Silverado 1500 from Colonial during the Memorial Day sale. Aside from the great discount I got, the service Colonial provided was exceptional. I live in Maryland so I was unable to be present to sign any of the paperwork. Joe Pells did a great job finding the exact truck I wanted and then overnighting the package for me to sign. Once I picked the truck up he walked through all the features with me and even synced my bluetooth. I wouldn't buy another Chevy anywhere else.]
