[113521137182656992250,100409781126639261760,The reason why Ledingham Properties even received a good rating as far as I'm concerned is the fact that they seem to want to perpetuate the mystique of a "safe" neighborhood, which if anyone even checks out KSL knows is not true of Salt Lake City, unless you can afford to pay buckets of money in rent. I happen to be old enough to have a past and this management company doesn't seem to be sympathetic toward an individual who happens to work hard for a living and has learned from her past. I just wonder how many pedophiles, and practicing criminals they currently have residing in their precious homes/condos. I'm not afraid to voice my displeasure in the fact that although they will not reconsider their stance towards good people who have made mistakes in the past they continue to perpetuate a lie "Salt Lake City" is not a "safe" city, check out the news and judge for yourself. I still think that it is admirable that they want to protect themselves from me and others "good for them", I wonder what happens when their children need a rental?]
