[104801448200002356350,100856435472971530669,About a 15 minute walk from either Mainz Hilton, Rosis has excellent food and great beer with a warm and inviting staff and atmosphere. Husband Werner (?) is the waiter and wife Rosie (?) is the chef. One of their signature meals is the "Big Ed" or schweinehaxe, but everything on the menu is fantastic. Small yet inviting with only about 7 tables, I recommend reservations especially on Friday and Saturday nights. Additional outside seating is available during the summer months.]
