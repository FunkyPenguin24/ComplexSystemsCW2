[118286653708099153876,100109788042747804705,I moved down to Baton Rouge, LA from Alexandria, VA for a job. During my final round of interviews, my future boss took me around several apartments in the area. I visited The Reserve, its sister community The Enclave, and Millenium Towne Center around the corner on Jefferson. Ultimately, I chose The Reserve because even though the appliances were not "upgraded" as they were in The Enclave (they're still brand new, though!), the rent was about $100/month cheaper. I absolutely love this community, and would recommend it to anyone. It's a gated community that requires a remote to open the gates to drive or walk in, there is obvious security presence in public areas during the day (they have even stopped me to ask for my resident's pass, which was comforting), and from 8 PM to midnight, there's an on-duty police officer patrolling. I have never felt unsafe within the gates at night. My experience with the leasing office employees has also been fantastic - Caley is absolutely the best. The other residents are also very friendly, a lot of families and young couples. On a Friday night, sometimes you'll hear music, but there are never loud, raucous parties, it seems. The pool area is always pristine, and the fitness center, though small, always has machines free for use. I haven't had any issues with apartment appliances yet, but the a/c works great, and the kitchen is superb. At some point, I may upgrade to the apartment with 1 BR and a Study, but I would love to continue to call The Reserve home.]
