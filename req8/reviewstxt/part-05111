[107099098715901143345,100428868970568913121,They have little or no stock of anything but candy and plenty of hygiene products. I found the pharmacist in charge that rude, demeaning and just a mean person. I am not biased on my opinion of the store versus the pharmacy experience. I got what I came for at the store finally, but also noted they have very little stock of anything. They re a relatively new store, but really. I'd go to any Walgreens any day. The pharmacists at Wal-Mart are nicer than the one man I experienced at the pharmacy. Just plain arrogant and mean! I won't buy a shot of insulin from that place if I were dying from an overdose of sugars]
