[113832154827996507390,100239386461544861909,We just stopped for lunch today at what we thought was a local diner. BTW - The Indian Fry Bread Salad was wonderful! After lunch we perused the gift shop where we were told about an adjacent museum with the Dukes of Hazard Car, over 30 buildings, and 300 cars! We were also told of the fact by a very nice salesperson from our neighboring state of Louisiana about American Pickers recently featuring the museum. Who woulda thunk! We went to the museum door where we were personally and graciously greeted by the owner Dave Geisler. OMG!!!!! We saw every car imaginable! It was totally amazing! We even saw one of Elvis' motorcycles! Bring quarters. You can play all sorts of antique devices. We only had one quarter, so we tried a rinkey-tink piano. The museum went on and on. The cars were only part of it - and this place put the fantastic car museum in Shreveport (next to the casinos) to shame! It even had a 1964 Avanti - a car I coveted in my teenage years. Needless to say, the 1922 motor home, the antique tractors, the old radio shack, well, you get the idea, were unbelievable. Today was my first time ever in South Dakota and I will never forget it! Tomorrow, Wall Drug Store, Badlands, and later Mount Rushmore. Does it get any better?]
