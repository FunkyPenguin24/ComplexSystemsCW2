[105620687007537530804,100094543906760426869,My 11-year-old daughter and I went Friday night and we both thought the hamburgers were terrific - not too big, not too small, just the right size. They were hand-shaped - in our lingo "homemade" and tasted like a real grilled hamburger you'd enjoy at a really nice barbeque. Very good meat, not greasy at all. We sat at the counter and enjoyed the milk shake samples passed to us by a friendly employee. In fact, all the staff was great to us. We are going back tonight.]
