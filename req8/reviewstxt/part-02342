[102811476655534410249,100279619015300492110,The store has a really great beer selection, but the manager is a sneaky liar when you're not one of his recognized regular customers. I was in his store a few days before the release of a big beer and talked to him a bit about it. He said he would have it in later that week. I happened to be at his store right when he received the beer later that week and even though I saw it right there on the floor, he said that he couldn't sell it to non regular customers. First off I hate liquor stores that hold back any product entirely for their friends or a few notable regulars. Second, he could have just told me earlier that week that while he is getting some in, it is all reserved, but I guess he knew I'd be back and hoped I'd spend some more money there anyway. He was dishonest to me, a customer, and wasted my time. I will not shop am establishment that disrespects their customers just because they aren't regulars.]
