[108043950295521724769,101104100727049584727,fat man blocks only walk way in to the store asked if I could be helped when I find another way around him. a few steps later I think that I hate what just happened and find my way out the sliding door is crap so I walk in to it the fat man says dont com back to his store I yell back no one should. I have bin going to this place many times and never had a problem all I can say is this the fat man is rude and in the way if he is the manager or store manager he is a bad one and I hope he spends the rest of his alone.]
