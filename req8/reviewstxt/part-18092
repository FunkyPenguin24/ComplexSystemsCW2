[110561359631195739892,101134580583504198053,This place really is great. Not only have I purchased a few bikes from them , but I also have gotten to know and develop a great relationship with the store. The owner 'Russ" knows his stuff, and wont steer you wrong weather its road biking, downhilling, or just casual riding. The staff is great and also knows the trade really well. I Mountain bike the local trails very frequently (Cunningham), and also do a lot of Downhilling at Mountain Creeek, which needless to say puts me in his shop quite often weather it be for tune ups, tires, tubes or a whole new bike! You really cant beat the prices, and I learn something new every time I go there. Thanks for taking care of the community ADT !]
