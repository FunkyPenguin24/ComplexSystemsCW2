[108999044654372777418,100303198968936692482,Deservedly popular place. Very attentive and friendly service, never overbearing. Good food. The vegetarian red curry was delicious: crunchy vegetables, coconut milk just piquant enough. Clearly they use the best ingredients and the cook knows what she or he is doing.]
