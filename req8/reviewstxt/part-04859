[112874555836553353218,100416353498484764711,Brakes went out and other shops were estimating $400-$500 to replace the master cylinder... I called Action Auto and Joe got my car in, looked at AND fixed in little over 2 hrs with a bill of less than $200! Turns out there was a leak right at the caliper no one else even bothered to look at or mention. I will not be going anywhere else. :-)]
