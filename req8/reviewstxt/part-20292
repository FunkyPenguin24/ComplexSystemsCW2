[108496535510971665783,100076028536518846252,I have used LBX for help with installing residential lighting and have been very happy with the service, product, and price. I actually first used LBX about 5 years ago and just went back in there recently as I needed some modifications to my lights. I walked in and did not expect the owner of LBX to remember me since so much time had passed. Not only did he remember my name, he remember the actual layout of my home and the lighting design that was installed. I was pretty impressed and a great example that LBX cares about each of its customers and will not forget you after the sale is closed.]
