[102559277494898530629,100151439087141184924,worst cut my dog has ever had. might be a good veterinary hospital but the grooming secions was AWFUL. not only did the lady do the exacccct opposite of what i asked of her, but when i called and complained, she was more than RUDE on the phone not to mention unprofessional(laughing at the matter). everyone else i spoke with was perfectly pleasant with the exception of her. not only that, but when i got home from work the same day, i found CUTS, yes CUTS on my dogs neck under his chin where she had basically shaved him which was not asked of her. i asked for the same length all around and got shaved in some parts long in other parts and medium in others. non transitional. i would honestly not recommend her- i went bc of the ratings on here, which it didnt live up to.]
