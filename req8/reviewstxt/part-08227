[107917732139105572529,100600093372869306850,I ordered a large Veggie Pizza, they said 45 min, Pizza arrived 90 minutes later, totally cold and tasted like absolute crap.. my girlfriend got sick all night.. I call the manager to give him a chance to rectify the situation.. his weaseled out saying my phone number wasn't in his computer .. we paid cash , so we have to record of it... this is the worse place ever to order a pizza.. avoid it.. we will.. I will tell all my neighbors..]
