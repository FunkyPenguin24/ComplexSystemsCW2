[117353127387749472715,100145427551084661735,I remember when that little spot was a diner called The Ring. Best hot dogs and burgers in town for a long time. Now it's a really good spot for great Thai food at a very reasonable price. A friend brought me there, and I was impressed. The jerky was great, and the "Awesome Noodles" actually lived up to the name. My friend ordered food that would melt the space shuttle, so I didn't try it, but she said it was great. The decor is very old-town, which helps with the charm. You can hear the bands on the stage in back of the club next door, but that's not a bad thing, depending on your taste in music. Our waiter was very cool and knowledgeable of the food. We waited for our check for a few minutes, but that's understandable because they were very busy. That in itself is a good sign... and to add to that, there were quite a few people of Asian culture eating there, which is considered to be the first sign of a good Asian restaurant. This is one of those cool "hole-in-the-wall" spots with great food. I'll be back there frequently since I live only a few blocks away.]
