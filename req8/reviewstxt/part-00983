This is word for word what I wrote the manager who said he wanted to hear about my experience and then didn't reply when I said I was busy at work and couldn't call them but could email a response to whatever they wanted. My fiance an I were seated by the hostess and given menu's. We stat there for 15 or more minutes before a random waitress had noticed that we hadn't been helped. She was very polite but we had already been sitting there for a long time without even a glass of water. I watched as people who had arrive after us were getting drinks and one couple with a kid I noticed even received their meal. We were finally helped by a very polite waitress who's name I don't remember because my stomach was telling me that it was tired of waiting for food. A short while afterward the manager came over to apologize to us and offer complementary desserts. But it's kind of hard to listen to a guy offering deserts when you still haven't received your intended order. He excused himself and said he would come back to check on us. The food arrived and the waitress checked on us a few more times. I had the Mo's Ruben and my fiance had a grilled vegetable sandwich. She said hers tasted ok but the ruben lacked the taste of a ruben. It was a clump of meat with the thinnest sprinkling of sour kraut and an even thinner amount of thousand island dressing lumped together in a small sandwich which left me unsatisfied. Shortly after a large cookie with a scoop of ice cream appeared. This was the only delicious memorable item during the visit. After we finished dessert we waited for the bill to come and the manager to come back to check on us and all we got was the bill. We paid and left. Unlike other food establishments nobody said bye or held the door. And now I'm at home listening to my fiance re-experiencing her dinner in reverse. It's not a happy sound.]
