[106617530359827012183,101168265432957241614,They sold me a car battery with a three year warranty that started going bad after a year or so. I brought it in to be replaced and they said there was nothing wrong with it. Said there must be something wrong with my car (which I know it's not my car). They weren't willing to work with me at all about getting a replacement. I'm not going there again.]
