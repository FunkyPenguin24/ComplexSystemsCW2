[113173958411279304883,100700212779030248554,Disappointed to hear my parents were not looked after. They lost their bus ticket and had to walk back to Gray line office. They wouldn't replace their ticket even though they had their credit card details from the morning. They were exhausted from walking with bad knee and very sad and disappointed missing 2 out of 3 days in New York all the way from Australia. Shocked to hear staff did not care at all.]
