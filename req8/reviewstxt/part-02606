I personally like a dry rub on my chicken so it was a bit too saucy for me, but the sauce was great so it didn’t bother me. Their mac n cheese was gone in seconds. We loved their vinegar slaw – so fresh. Everyone at the party agreed that it was great BBQ and FRESH. . For the price we got amazing BBQ, amazing service and everything was included.]
