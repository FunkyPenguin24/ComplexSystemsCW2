[103206432182594138188,100955377419812990279,My friend and I went to Pho Van Van after work. It was a Thursday at about 4 PM. We mentioned to the waiter that we were going to have a few beers then eat later. He brought us our beers, then seemed to forget about us. The first couple of times, it was easy to get his attention, then he just disappeared. We were able to get the attention of different waitstaff at different times through the night, but they were very inattentive. I had the curry chicken fried rice, which was excellent. If the waitstaff had been professional, this would have been a great place. Beers were 4.25 for domestic and 5.25 for imports. The curry chicken fried rice was 8.25.]
