[109428105925176029309,100746354404930191822,I had been shopping around for a new car to lease for my wife. After driving 6 or 7 comparable models It was obvious to me that the 2013 Elantra GT had everything I was hoping to find and with a very reasonable leasing program it was my obvious choice. Ira was very knowledgeable and helpful and made the process very easy. Thanks Ira! My wife loves the car and I have the peace of mind that she is in a solid vehicle for the next few years.]
