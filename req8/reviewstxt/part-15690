[113217933108344206044,101004019384174626896,I went in for an oil change and to check a valve on my front left tire. They did the oil change and checked and repaired the valve. The following day the light came on showing the air pressure was AGAIN low. I had to go back on a Saturday morning. Fortunately the mechanic checked the valve that was repaired and found nothing wrong. He then checked all the tires and found a nail in the back tire!!! They plugged it and I was on my way! Thank you Advantage Toyota!]
