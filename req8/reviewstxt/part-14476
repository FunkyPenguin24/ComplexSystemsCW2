[102444938935203731432,100938722247149423589,Been traveling to Best Westerns a lot recently. This one is a disappointment. Hard to get into the driveway from the freeway. The place needs a little refurishment. The beds are small. The TVs are old tubes, their cable sucks (fuzzy and few channels). Bathrooms small and outdated. Rooms are hard to get around in. The fences between the parking lot and the rooms need more "holes" in them so you can get to your vehicles easier.]
