[101128606355087385420,100687512037040792296,Super friendly from start to finish. Quick, efficient, and most importantly, painless. I got gassed on the house, and even an additional discount for taking care of the procedure on the spot. Don't kid yourself this is a business like any other, but they were good about explaining all the associated costs as they went along, instead of saving the surprise for the end, which is greatly appreciated. Overall, I would recommend their services. Dr. Aggarwal was very friendly, just short of funny, but I wasn't there for a comedy show either. She was done removing my wisdom tooth before I even knew it. Thanks for the painless, professional, and quick service. Great team!]
