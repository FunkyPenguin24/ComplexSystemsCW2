There is a lot of crime and there are no security officers on site only curtisy officers who look around scan the area from getting out of their car to opening their ffront door. Poor lighting in the parking lot and the office is friendly upon move in only. When you call to speak w management no one is in the office and they dont call back. This company like most have become money hungry and have forgotten about taking care of their residents June of 2011]
