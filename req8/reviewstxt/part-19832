[106025468848457694458,100051441469526324594,I recently purchased a 2012 Mazda 3 Skyactiv sedan for my college-age daughter. The Mazda rep that I dealt with, Mike Sharma, was knowledgeable and professional in every way. Transaction went flawlessly. No hard sale and my terms were met in every respect. I recommend both the vehicle and the buying experience with Mike Sharma. Time spent with the Financing Manager was the briefest that I've ever encountered. Based upon my recent experience with this transaction I heartily recommend Courtesy Imports! Dante Amato, AIA]
