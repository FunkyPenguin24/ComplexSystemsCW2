[106920947278263494664,100001749010947117643,The best hand made ice cream in White Rock. The owner has a passion for ice cream and it shows. Many different flavors available at a great price. I've never NEVER been disappointed. Only ice cream shop I go to now in White Rock. Also - the owner usually has Frank Sinatra and music like that playing, so call him "Sinatra" when you go.]
