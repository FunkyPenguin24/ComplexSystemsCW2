[102573362023790818887,100166413364833439330,was looking for a burger and was surprised to find that the night I visited was $5 burger night. My only complaint would be that it didn't match the Tavern Burger on the menu - no pretzel bun (which I would have loved to try.) Server was friendly and attentive. Had a nice evening.]
