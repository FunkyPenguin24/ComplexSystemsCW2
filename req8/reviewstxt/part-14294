[102205065437430761287,100928073188276586399,Platypus Wine Tours provides a very entertaining wine tour experience. Our tour guide was knowledgeable, funny and very flexible. He quizzed us on what our tastes and background in wine and made some recommendations as to the wineries we could visit, and in no time we had our short list, We had a join in tour, so of course we didn't know the other people we were with but by end of the tour I feel like we'd made a bunch of new friend. First rate, I'd go back.]
