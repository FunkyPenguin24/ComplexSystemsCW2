[106012341210488246605,100418797927239867848,Checked out the firing range on ladies night,and had a very enjoyable experience. I went back the following ladies night and the owner let me test fire a cool little Walther .380 He took the time on the range to show me all the features the gun had and how it operates. He took a few shots too and "comp-ted" the ammo. I loved it so much I bought a brand new one in PINK! If you want a great gun buying experience or want to shoot a gun before buying one,this is the place to go.They are open til 9pm so it very convenient any night of the week. Bring your lady on Wednesday and she shoots for free! You'll probably see me there! huge selection,knowledgeable help,great prices.]
