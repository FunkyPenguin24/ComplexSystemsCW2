[112689605657693945903,100290500931663384524,Martin and mike came by because my timer was leaking. Martin referred to my unit as an antique, but said it was still serviceable. They looked over the hardware in the utility room, found some light corrosion on a water heater, noted that my water pressure was at max and then proceeded to do a fine job on the repair of my antique. They made a heart felt pitch for a new unit, but weren't pushy about it. One day the antique will need to be replaced, when I do, I will have Martin and Mike do it for me they were absolutely professional and courteous. Great service guys.]
