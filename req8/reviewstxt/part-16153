[110618272120997880044,101029472837746020324,I love the food at Minh Chau. I regularly go here for lunch as it's a short walk from my office. The service is not the best at times. Try to avoid having them come back since you need a minute. If you know what you want, just order it the first time they come over or it may be a little bit. Staff is friendly though so it's not the end of the world. Yes as others have said, it's a bit of a dive place and not a great date location (for new couples at least) but the food more than makes up for it. Don't be deterred by the other people on here, I have never had any issues with the food!]
