[117707960352185977147,100437204780702843977,Went there last night for a sinus infection. Had never been there before, told the front desk that I've had many sinus infections in past, was so congested that I couldn't eat or drink, and only needed an antibiotic to clear the infection. I'm retired, but don't qualify for medicare yet; don't have insurance, no primary physician, and asked for a rough estimate of cost. Told it would depend on what was done. That's when I should have left, suffered through another night, and gone somewhere else today. I didn't undress, no blood-work or imaging done. Nurse took my vitals, doctor looked in throat and ears, listened to my chest for 10 seconds, and typed out two prescriptions. The bill was $209, and I paid by credit card. One prescription cost $50 so I only had the $29 prescription filled. My daughter had called another convenient care center in Columbia that quoted her a very reasonable price, but they would have closed before I could get there. Patient First refuses to give any kind of estimate and then hits you with a ridiculous bill!!! I'll never return! I pay my bills, and promptly; however, I feel Patient First's practices are deceptive, and they take advantage of people requiring medical attention.]
