[115623429387522344988,100205541198990012782,I have dined here several times; business lunch, special Valentine's Day dinner, and just for a regular Friday meal in the evening. The wait is sometimes long but it has always been worth it. Food is well prepared and as expected. The servers have been excellent. There is no better place in Greeneville to get a great meal and be treated well.]
