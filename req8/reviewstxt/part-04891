[103783135566253520075,100417888493355291601,Myself, my wife and our two kids went in for dinner 6/29/13. Service was very slow. Beverages took about 10 minutes to come out (soft drinks, margarita and a Guinness). The food took nearly 40 minutes from order to delivery. My open faced prime rib sandwich may have been prime rib but it was more like thinly sliced overcooked deli roast beef with a single slice of cheese on top served over a single piece of bread. My wife ordered the loaded irish fries. She described it as fries served over a layer of Mrs. Dash seasoning with canned chili and a slight amount of beer cheese on top. There was a solid layer of Mrs. Dash seasoned salt on the plate in and under the fries. You could pick the granules up in your fingers. Kids meals (cheese quesadillas and pasta) were OK. Avoid this restaurant! It has no redeeming value whatsoever. I only wish I could give it negative numbers. If you find yourself in Wildood/The Villages, do yourself a big favor, go elsewhere!]
