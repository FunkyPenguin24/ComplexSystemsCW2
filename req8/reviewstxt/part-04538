I heard from great men, Yoga originated from Lord SHIVA. I had a feeling of being among the most busy professionals on earth, when I thought to take a break from the work as it was breaking my focus and concentration on work. I decided to go for Yoga course and started searching online for the same. Got a lot of information but yet was not able to finalize the destination and the best ally. Staying near to Rishikesh, in Delhi, I visited the place and started exploring the places to get my reincarnation what I was expecting. I explored till the last construction made in city near the holy valley and found Mahatmayoga ashram. When I entered i saw no promotion environment for the Yoga courses in fact it was mere attraction for the place forced me to enter. I saw fair colored people and learnt that people from other part of the world has reached before me to be benefited from Yoga. When these people smiled at me even being unknown, made me think of the values this place is associated with. I was roaming in the arena and reached the top floor where it was happening what I was searching for. Yogi ji taking classes for meditation and talking about a lot of things which I should sit and keep listening. It took hardly 10 minutes for me to decide when to start and how to make the required arrangements. I would say the rest here remains with the most beautiful part of my life, feeling happy is what I learnt ultimately. Apart from the Yoga classes there is a lot to learn and practice. The place to live, the surroundings to spend time, the sound of water, the haziness of mountains and absence of any man made creation, made the life for a few days like I was living with nature. I will happily say, the best place to go for Yoga is Mahatmayoga ashram. Once you come you never go from here. You feel like a family.]
