[104990581129231982701,100227090058356620958,Needed a storage unit before I moved to a new place and found this place on-line and boy was I lucky! The facility was clean, well lit and state of the art. I was assisted by two professional gentlemen Ernie and Danny, they were extremely friendly and very knowledgeable. They actually stayed 30 minutes past their closing time to explain how to store my items and discussed moving companies. Even though I will not be renting from them because the place I am moving to has on site storage, I will be utilizing their storage next month when my sister moves back.]
