[112805050149313177509,100703077185811371152,The best beef burger I have ever had, and the second best burger (the other being a bison burger at a high class NYC restaurant) For the price you cannot get a better deal. A buck more for twice the buger and 10x the taste than a bigmac. Tons of seasoned fries.]
