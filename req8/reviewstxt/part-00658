[111411167436032293338,100193927687011109149,I had planed on a dinner with my family at the buffet this evening. with The website advertizes crab legs on Sundays. When I called to ask a question on how young children have to be to get their dinner half price they told me 11 years old, why isn't this stated on their website. When I confirmed about them selling crab legs on Sundays, they told me they don't. In my eyes this is false advertizing. So now I have been sitting here on hold for the last 10 min making me late for 12:00 mass. Their also advertising cold crab legs on Saturday is this another misrepresented statement as well what is true on this website. Who is maintaining this website and who are they getting their direction from. Maybe Dover Downs Hotel and Casino might want to look into hiring better commentate people in their communications department so this never happens again. With the bad economy businesses should be more careful on how they handle everyday operations and pay better attention to the small details, like menus on their websites. I have now been on hold for the last 25 min waiting on a supervisor. It just goes to show you how some people really care. I'm wondering now if the women who answered the phone is in fact really even getting some one to talk to me regarding this issue. This is why people are wondering why this state is spiraling out of control. Its all the incompatible people who don't want to work. I now cant go to church because i have been on hold since 11:50 am its now been 35 min and I'm still holding. Unreal !! After I spread this blog through social media maybe then they will start caring.]
