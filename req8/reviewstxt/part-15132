[103946051785160352453,100973795444049249967,I had made an appointment almost 2 months ahead of time for a manicure that was included in a wagjag. I arrived on time for my appointment. they were not even open. There was me and another lady waiting out in the cold for over an hour and no one showed up. paid for something that i never received. Avoid this place at all costs.]
