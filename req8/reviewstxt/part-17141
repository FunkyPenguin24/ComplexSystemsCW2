[105017008457466848623,101083741589719526807,I went with four of my friends on Saturday 14th December 2013 for the whole day. Although the weather was horrific (it was cold, foggy, windy and it rained heavy all day), we really loved it. Everything was well organised and staff members were very friendly. The only downside was the large number of people at the beginning of the day. Apart from that I can only recommend it to everyone, especially if you don't mind getting stuck in.]
