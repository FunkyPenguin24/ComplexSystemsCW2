[113753401947940040594,101150668063404822190,Absolutely friendly service, I don't have the best schedule and the are open til midnight and live around the corner. I like the deli and they close at 10, but I came in at 10:10 PM and the nice lady cleaning up said they closed at 10 but would be happy to honor my request. She was very helpful and asked if I would care for anything else with a smile. Prices are a little high but the service makes up for it.]
