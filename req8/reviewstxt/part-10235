[101274913730213933778,100706739292134132755,I just finished my stay at the Shamrock Hotel in Toowoomba which lasted a week. I heard a lot of bad stories about the last owners, but to me it seems like they are addressing everything possible. The last staff at the Shamrock so far as I have heard were all sacked for unprofessionalism, dishonesty, or what have you but I have never been there before so honestly can't comment. The whole inside and outside of the licensed section of the premises is being renovated to be brought up to a modern look. They are putting in a new TAB, Gaming Room, I think they are even putting in a night club. I ate there every night and the food was always delicious, especially considering how well priced everything on the menu is. The entertainment was more than you get from any other pub in Toowoomba I am guessing as there was Karaoke and Live bands on just about every night while I was there. The rooms were so much bigger than the last hotel that I had to stay in for a month, but they were both around the same price. The rooms were spotless and looked good but no doubt will be even better after the accommodation section of the hotel is finished being fully renovated too. The housekeeping staff were really friendly, I would probably even describe them more as "Cool." The bar staff, the management, everyone in that place was just so friendly, I think most guests who stay actually would become friends with them. I also made friends with other guests too, it is just that sort of friendly place. There is only one place I am staying next time I go to Toowoomba, and I recommend you to too.... Shamrock Hotel in Toowoomba Rocks, thanks guys.]
