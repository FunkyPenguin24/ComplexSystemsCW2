[108297545156823855212,101021517221837250026,I haven't taken classes here but my wife teaches an independent Irish Dance class at these studios and I'm in the studio a lot. These are some of the friendliest people with real passion and a longevity teaching dance to youngsters. The studio is always clean and serves a lot of different purposes for different community needs. I've peeked in on some of Sue's own dance classes and she is a strong teacher: demanding in her standards but kind and personal in her approach. Definitely worth supporting this independent dance family!]
