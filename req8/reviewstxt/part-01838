If delivering, the ingredients they use are top notch and very fresh. The family size pizza is more than enough to last a couple of days for a family of four, and there's nothing like eating pizza the next morning when you're starving! They do tend to burn the cheese a little bit. It's not often, but every now and then it seems the pie gets left in the oven in a little too long. I love this pizza place, though, and feel it's a gem within Homewood.]
