[104963268635171698618,100840511630219624969,We recently bought a 2013 Hyundai Elantra from this dealership. At first, our experience was not pleasant due to the salesperson. Had we not already put down a deposit on a vehicle we had ordered, we would have take our business somewhere else. We went to the management to discuss what was happening and the management team, led by Sales Manager Ariel, could not have been more helpful. Since we were expecting to have the vehicle on a certain date, and had made arrangements based on that, they made sure we had a courtesy car to use until our car arrived. Ariel addressed all of our concerns and made it right. His customer service was top notch. He was respectful and helpful throughout our car-buying experience. Despite our issue with the salesperson, we are giving this 5 stars because Ariel really went above and beyond. We're glad we stayed with this dealership and we have no hesitations in recommending buying a car from Ariel. Also, we love our new Hyundai!]
