[112174589629173165918,100760117822601218311,Wow! incredibly easy to deal with. Ned Guarda was my salesperson and he was very knowledgeable, friendly and customer service oriented. The whole deal was handled on the dealership's end in a very professional manner. I wish that all my past car buying experiences were this great. My wife and I bought a 2013 jeep Grand Cherokee Limited and we stopped in to Helfman while on our way to another Jeep dealership. We are very glad we did. If we purchase another Chrysler product it would only be from Ned at Helfman. We financed our car through Helfman even though I had been pre-approved through both USAA and my credit union. Helfman's terms were equal and Juan in the finance department was efficient and professional in the way he handled our deal. I always buy an extended warranty on my vehicles due to the mileage I drive each year and was glad to see that Helfman did not try to sell me some third party warranty but one that is from the manufacturer.]
