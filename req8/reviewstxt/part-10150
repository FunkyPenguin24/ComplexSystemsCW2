[100355210959034448285,100702152645237186195,This was easily one of the best decisions I have ever made. I am an amateur mechanic myself but when I picked up a subaru wrx to fix up, I was out of my league. I bought it knowing some work had to be done and after I bought it I noticed a work receipt from the previous owner said the mechanic recommended a whole new engine! I felt absolutely sick. A fellow car enthusiast recommended local wrench. They ran a few tests and eventually figured out my car was misfiring due to a simple melted wire going to the cylinder. Not only did I NOT need a new engine, instead of buying a whole new 900 dollar wiring harness THEY BUILT the one piece of the harness I needed, which saved me about 850 dollars. I would say I SAVED THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS by taking my car here! These guys know their stuff and are not in the business to rip you off. Some of the most honest mechanics you will ever meet and Jeff calls you up and fills you in every step of the way. You would be absolutely crazy to take your car anywhere else!]
