[114854712395764837591,101099505783568831000,Nice atmosphere, decent food. Awful service. When we arrived, we were pleasantly greeted and taken to our table. We are all looking through our menu, and decided what we wanted. My friend wanted his turkey wrap without cabbage, but the waitress very rudely informed us that everything on the menu comes as is, and that we were not allowed to order changes. This should not be how a restaurant works. At all. Anyways, he decides it won't be a big deal, and we all order. My pesto pizza is quite delicious, and $9 (a bit pricey, but not surprising with a "specialty" pizza). I do not have cash on me, and my friends only have enough to cover their meals, so I ask the waitress to put my meal on my card and then take the rest from the cash. She states she can't do that because there is a $10 minimum charge, so I suggest she put $10 on my card and give my friends more change back. She ARGUED with me that I would "lose a dollar to the house" for a solid minute before she realized what I was saying, and when she finally did, she did not apologize. Our change should have been $1 (everything on the menu is at a flat dollar amount, no change, no tax listed on the bill either) and she returned with $0.50. I think you can figure out what her tip was. I'm a local, and I will never pay to eat here again.]
