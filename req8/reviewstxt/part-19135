[103507806731128309894,100012805479414588417,My boyfriend LOVES Mexican food and every time we are at the JC he has to eat here, it’s not a choice for me, but I don’t mind I love the burritos the enchiladas and the tamales. He on the other hand always get the same grande polo burrito, he just can’t get enough of it.]
