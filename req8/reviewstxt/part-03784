[101167578140183642858,100357425985169352836,We purchased a TV stand From Scott at Woodley's. Really love the quality, and Scott was very good to work with, really listened to what we needed. Scott didn't try to "sell us" but took the time to help find the piece that fit our space. We didn't spend a lot of money but were treated as if we did.]
