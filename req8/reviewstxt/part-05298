[105650489114984428965,100441178568609850729,I have used this Busy Bee Car Wash location for several years now. I regularly take my VW Rabbit and Toyota Camry into the wash without any issues. You may get unlucky and show up at a time when they are busy but they do a good job of getting people in and out. They have spent several months upgrading their automatic wash and added many more vacuums etc. So give them a try, you may have a different experience. No complaints from me. Of course when I plan on waxing, polishing or using a clay bar I will always wash by hand.]
