[103481772856038793019,100153791810235940052,My experience with the team at Westgate Chevrolet was simply awesome. Not only did I recieve a fair value for my trade in but a great price for my new 2012 Chevy Cruze. I live in the Dallas Fort Worth Metroplex and I was hesitant to purchase a vehicle sight unseen from Amarillo. However, the whole package deal was so appealing that I could not pass up the offer. Westgate even had my new Cruze delieverd to my home. I would recommend John Thurlow and his team to anyone. Thanks Westgate Chevrolet!!!!!]
