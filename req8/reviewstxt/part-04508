[101821377210880204288,100399227136496364598,I had one of our Smart cars in for $650 worth of damage done to the vehicle. After several weeks they sent a revised estimate to the insurance company for $2,900 and didn't notify us about what the other damages were and what we wanted to have done. After 5 weeks they said the car was ready but we had to bring it back for a new rim because they ordered the wrong one, Rim !!! what was wrong with the rim, when I went in to ask them about all the charges they go real defensive and said no on ever want to know what wrong they just want it fixed. I explained that I owned the car, not them or the insurance company and I would like to know, their office manager came out with the paper work and tried to explain to me then she started yelling at me, calling me a smart ass and an ass hole, at that point I knew it was time to leave, I told her that was real professional yelling at me and calling me names. she was still yelling at me as I was walking to the parking lot to get in my car and leave. She was running after me telling me to take my god dam car, I explained I couldn't drive to cars at once and waived her off and drove away.]
