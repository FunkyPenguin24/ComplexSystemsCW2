[109006885498808685673,100093865730575919802,not wanting to sound like i'm over-exaggerating, but the reviews from those prior are spot on - this is a shoddy and lousy service. made a phone booking the night before in which they took my arrival details and gave me clear instructions on where to wait. stood waiting for one hour for the shuttle to come when i arrived but an absolute no show. fortunately did not provide any payment or credit card details and got a ride with a different shuttle service. book at own risk!]
