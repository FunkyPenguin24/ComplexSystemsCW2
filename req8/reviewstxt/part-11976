[101437705238028978638,100799943565311229599,I have used them for a variety of reasons during the past years. Firstly, they have done a splendid job in terms of accommodating a number of high ranking officials for 3 different Medical conferences with their quality service, backed by luxurious vehicles such as Mercedes S550 and Cadillac Escalade. In addition, I have also used them twice (and recommended them to friends and family members) for transportation to and fro, from Port Canaveral to Orlando Airport. Furthermore, they have a huge fleet of limo's including Hummer H2 to special occasions (a destination wedding in my case) with phenomenal service. All in all, their prices are competitive, the service is extraordinary, their drivers are personable and I would'nt choose anybody else over them within the Central Florida Area.]
