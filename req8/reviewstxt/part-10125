[111340756538173367030,100700708303732907731,Sugarland Mixed Martial Arts is an excellent place to train! They offer high quality instructors that care and that believe in growing relationships with customers. The first time I walked into the school, I was greeted immediately by the one of the owners and felt welcome and comfortable. It was in no way intimidating like some of the other experiences I had before from other schools in the past. Since I have started training I feel great, more confident, and have lost several pounds. Daniel, Chad, and Jeff are high quality instructors who provide the perfect balance of professionalism, friendliness, hard work, and fun for their students. This place is the best! It is also a kid friendly martial arts school that dedicates itself to teaching children hard work, discipline, confidence, and self-control.............I would and have recommend this place any day over any other MMA School! Thank You SLMMA for all that you do for your customers, it does not go un-noticed!]
