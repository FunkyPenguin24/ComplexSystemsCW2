[111726742274282807854,100745075517386169486,Best customer service I have ever experienced. My entire family use this mechanic shop. Always feel like I'm being lied to by other shops just to squeeze more money out of me, not the case with GC Automotive. Everything is explained to me if I don't understand why the work is needed and they will show me why it was replaced/fixed. Will never go anywhere else]
