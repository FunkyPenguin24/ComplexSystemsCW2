[111400263528856106278,100894198505209248154,Called Jerry and he responded by phone in short time period. Very informative and extremely pleasant over the telephone. Came out and did a superb job of not only repairing my immediate problem of no heated air but changed out drum cable and pulley as well and much cheaper than everyone else. I will always use this guy because he is FIRST CLASS!!]
