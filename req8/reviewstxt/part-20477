[105698020524658909061,100084848090160527504,We are glad we found you - by luck! - because NOW we have mechanics here we trust! (We're pretty new to STL). Thanks so much for your wonderful service and explaining what was needed. We will be back! We had a bad experience with another place (hint: it rhymes with robb's) and didn't know who we could trust... I'm from a small town, so I am used to knowing people who will fix stuff or help me, and knowing who I can trust to do good work... I was scared that being here, in the city, I wouldn't find that kind of place or people again. But my husband and I found you, and now we aren't worried about that any more. Anytime someone tells me that they are having car problems, need an inspection, or want to get a car checked out before buying, I'm going to tell them about Henry's!]
