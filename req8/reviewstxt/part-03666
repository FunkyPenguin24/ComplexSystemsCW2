[107955409265681727306,100350597430704565211,I shop Claudia's frequently. The store is welcoming, clean, and organized. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and the owner herself is engaging and personable. If I don't find what I am looking for, they can order it or I often find something new to try. The prices are worth it because you can't pay enough for a store that is welcoming, with staff that cares.]
