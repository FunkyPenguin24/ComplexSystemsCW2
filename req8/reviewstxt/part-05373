[102018277119334315471,100444954555021524880,Do not go here! We took our newly bought '78 Chevy pickup to them in July. What was supposed to be a two week job ended up taking two months, in no small part because because when they Rhino-lined the bed they let it drip all over the new paint job and had to redo that. Later they were supposed to send us some touch-up paint and never did. My husband ended up just picking some up when he had to go back (big surprise!) because they had messed up the quarter-panel. Finally, last weekend we had some bad scratches done, so he called this week and scheduled an appointment for this morning at 9:00. We get all the way up there (Did I mention we live in Longmont?) and the place is empty inside except some guy dry-walling. Needless to say, no one answered any of the phone numbers we had. With such a pattern of both poor work and customer service, Maaco should have revoked their franchise license a long time ago. They also should have had calls to the shop rerouted, starting immediately once it was know that they would be closing (as it appears that is what has happened), so that they couldn't spend their last few days setting up unsuspecting customers just to get back at Maaco.]
