[103384904171095224846,101012696040843859914,I was going over to another shop to sell my I Pad 4 when a guy stopped me and asked if I was looking for a loan on my I Pad. I said I was looking to sell it and he explained that he was with Big Daddy's and that they loved Apple products. I went in and he looked it over and asked what I wanted for it. I named my price and he said that seemed fair. After they checked it over, including making sure it connected to the Internet, they had me filled out a little paperwork (nothing major) and paid me my money. I sold items to other pawn shops and found that they checked what the item sells on Amazon or Ebay. Because of that it seems that most places will pay as little as they can get away with. Big Daddy's didn't do that. Big Daddy's will not rip you off. If your price is fair, you will probably get it. If it's too high, they will explain why they can't meet your price. If I ever need to sell anything again, I will be going back to Big Daddy's.]
