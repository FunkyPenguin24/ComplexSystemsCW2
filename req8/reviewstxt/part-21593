[102831896008776823243,100145119298191392780,Apparently this company also goes by the name "Syracuse Airport Taxi." I called and reserved a taxi to take me to the airport and was told I was all set and I'd get a call when they were on their way. I never received a call and the taxi never showed up. Someone forgot to put my request into the system, so the taxi was never dispatched. I ended up missing my flight and when I called Blue Star Taxi, the same dispatcher answered, unknown to me. When the taxi arrived at my house, I received a call from Syracuse Airport Taxi informing me that the Blue Star Taxi was in my driveway. I guess there are now "two" taxi companies that I will not be using in Syracuse.]
