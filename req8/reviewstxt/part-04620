[115505723088133942070,100405422915061795765,I started going to Blush shortly after it was founded by Soheila, my mom's hairdresser. Soheila was very particular about who she hired, so I never really worried about who cut my hair. Now Soheila has sold the company but I still go there. I've settled with Stephanie as my main hairdresser and she does a great job! I highly recommend this place, it's professional, clean and the people who work there are very talented.]
