[105981326376027940290,100696728637925288598,Hands down the BEST pastry place around. The cookies are to die for. The apricot turnover (my favorite) is amazing. From the crepes to the eggs Benedict, you can't go wrong. If it is busy, just wait and be patient knowing that you are about to enjoy some fabulous food. :) Once again, another fabulous meal! The addition of Debra to your staff is a huge win. She has amazing customer focus and the welcoming smile is the topper to the cake. Awesomeness at its best for certain.
