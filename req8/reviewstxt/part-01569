[113412985811589123412,100239457498224191655,Well My husband and I came into Boulder about 1 week ago... we found the Yellow Deli because we both love coffee, and I love to get on Free Wifi!! So we went to this place... At first we were very impressed with the interior, the restrooms, the flavor of the coffee, and Wifi... But I cant say all good about it... The people that work there are very plain, no personality at all!! They dont even come check on you to see if you need a refill or anything!! Their policy of 1 refill on coffee is ridiculous!! PLUS if you ask for Extra Sugar... they look at you like you are out of your mind!!! Talk about being "jewish"... these people are the epitomy of being "Jewish". Cant spare a few xtra packets of sugar for your customers that request it?? Sorry, but NO CUSTOMER SERVICE at all!! So they lost my business after I tried them 3x... 3x and your OUT if you dont give me the service that I expect and require from a "business".]
