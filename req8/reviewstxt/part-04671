[101533513546681005062,100407703144654178719,Definitely Jamaica's best kept secret. Such amazing food and an outstanding and courteous wait staff. I gain like 5 pounds every time I go because I can't stop eating the delicious food. The specialty cocktails are great and perfectly compliment the food. The prices are more than fair and I love the atmosphere of the whole restaurant. Oh yeah, definitely get the grit sticks!]
