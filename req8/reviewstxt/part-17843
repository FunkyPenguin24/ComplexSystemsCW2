[101932031522490643553,101121691602403626211,Overbooked on Saturday. Unfortunately the staff here does not realize you can't book a group every 4 minutes. We stopped at hole 5 because we didn't want to spend the whole day there, it had already been an hour and a half. We asked for a refund or at least to just pay for the 5 holes we played. They said they couldn't help us in any way. They ended up giving us $8 of our $52 back and said "thats all we can do." Why would you offer tee times you can't accomodate to? Obviously so you can load up the course and not allow refunds for people who don't want to spend 5 hours playing A PAR 3 COURSE. They lost a few customers.]
