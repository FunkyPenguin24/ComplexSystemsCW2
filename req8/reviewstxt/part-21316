[112401943491050713896,100130027149385743421,John was a pleasure to work with! We 've just moved into our new home one month ago and have had time to reflect on our experiences of purchasing a home. We appreciated the time John took to keep on top of all the crazy details and negotiations that come with buying a property from a bank. He really made the whole process smooth for us. Thank you John!]
