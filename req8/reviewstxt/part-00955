[110316907859349456549,100208639498152040956,I am came into Today's Vision Willowbrook with busted up glasses and was met by a friendly and super helpful Optician named Enrique. He looked up my account and was able to get me a new pair of glasses thru the warranty I had purchased less than a year ago. I love my glasses and now I don't have to do without them! Thank you so much Enrique!]
