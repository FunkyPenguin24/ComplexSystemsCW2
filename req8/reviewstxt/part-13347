[103004594062092366725,100876062789346750524,This place is great. I went to a doctor at Sams Club and then picked out a pair of glasses at See. The glasses I picked up were no good though and See said to go back to my doctor. I did and the doctor said the prescription was right. I went back to See and they had their doctor examine me for free and it turns out the doctor at See didn't know what they were doing. See redid my glasses for free and they are perfect.]
