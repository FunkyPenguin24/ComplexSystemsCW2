[102477683531272065853,100123966759033522568,On a recent Sunday afternoon, I decided to take the advice of a fried and try, what she described as the best pizza in the New Center / Midtown / Downtown Detroit area. I had been by this establishment on numerous occasions but never actually going in. I had always thought of it as a "burger and a beer joint". However, to my delight, it was much more than that. The atmosphere was relaxed and laid back, while the staff was very cordial and accommodating. After scanning the menu for ten minutes or so (took me a while to decide due to the multiple selections that tempted my taste buds), I decided on the Maui Wowie Pizza. I loved the fact that it was freshly made, small enough for one person and yet large enough to be split by two. Now I'm not one to embellish the merits of food...especially when it comes to pizza, but THIS pie was by far the BEST Hawaiian pizza that I had ever eaten, and I have eaten many. It chad just the right amount of toppings, with a flavorful crust and the fresh basil gave it a little extra surprise than would normally come on a Hawaiian style pizza. I highly recommend giving this place a try. I will definitely be making this place one of my haunts! The Maui Wowie will be by standard selection, but I look forward to the Bronx Bomber and the BBQ Chicken as well! Oh, and on a side note, I've heard that the beer here isn't too shabby either...lol]
