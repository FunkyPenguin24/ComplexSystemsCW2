[114603244310768476214,100809929980145034148,Hah! I called these guys to change out my garbage disposal. They wanted to charge me $70 to come out and give a price quote. They would waive the fee if I agreed to have them do the work. I asked what the ballpark price would be to change a garbage disposal, they wouldn't even give me a ballpark range. Are you kidding me? You want me to pay $70 to hear the price? There's a lot of plumbers in this town, no need to suffer through these shady practices. Avoid them.]
