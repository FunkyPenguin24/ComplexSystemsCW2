[103132645133430166929,100635123275142830601,I went to this doctor last week on 14/06/13 for male genital issuses not aid or any sexual problem's the doctor did not know what it was he looked on his iphone for help and then when he still could not find any thing he gave me a shot and some pills and told me i should feel better if not i need to go see a urologist! so i got some thing set up with them but i am still having pain the pain meds he gave me make me feel sick and want to throw up! So the urologist told me since these where making me feel bad i should just be able to talk to dr dan and he would be able to get me some thing knew to at least try!!!! Dr Said no you will have to come pay me again to get any thing different since i do not know what is wrong with you! i do not have insurance so you know how lovely that bill would be again plus the urologist bill will also be sky high i just done understand how this doctors office has done this same bs with other family members i would not go here if i was dying and it was the only place]
