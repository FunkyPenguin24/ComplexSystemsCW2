[104606322808801856034,100759641484465053803,I grew up around these Apartments I knew a lot of drug addicts from there. Also They are now kicking 6 month pregnant friend out of them because her boyfriend beat her up and is only giving her 3 days to vacate. So drug addicts are okay but victims of domestic violence are not?]
