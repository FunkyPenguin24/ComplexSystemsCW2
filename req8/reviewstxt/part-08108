[102250938673373633134,100593596713109452365,Idea dream wedding place. A must see for any party occasion. The banquet itself is a beautiful building outside and inside. On August 31st 2012 my niece had her wedding at this place. The service was excellent! The food superb and will presented. The servers were very courteous and patient. My family loved everything about this place. I give this place…. 5 stars. P.S. thank you for finding my one diamond- ruby earring – (sentimental to me) Thank you for your honesty.]
