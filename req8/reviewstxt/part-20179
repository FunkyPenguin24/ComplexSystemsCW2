[112096588026017647415,100069813897962670214,The employees at Pet Resorts always take excellent care of my little dog. When I go somewhere that I can't take my dog with me, then I always use Pet Resorts. They always follow what ever instructions that I leave for his care. He never comes home stinky or dirty. The facility is clean and never smells bad. I also like the fact that I can make my reservation on-line or by phone.]
