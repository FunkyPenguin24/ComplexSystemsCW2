[101210342664387981631,100535279465999206100,Stopped by on a whim. Thought it was going to be an actual Cafe. Turned out to be more high end priced food - Italian mostly but everything else reflected German. The waitstaff was standing around by the bar eating the bar nuts with the bartender. The kitchen is visible. One of the cooks was making smiley faces with an onion ring to the waitress, then put sauce on it and ate it right in front of all the diners. Didn't wash his hands afterwards. Flies everywhere - probably because the cooks were having a smoke out back when we got there with the back door wide open. My Daughters cheese fries had a hair in it. I sent it back and asked for another. No apologies or visit from the Manager (if there is one) and when the waiter brought it back he said "Here you go, nice clean fries". REALLY? Waiter offered my kids root beer and then brought bottles of root beer at $3.50 a piece. Somebody didn't bother to drain the pasta for my chicken parm so it was watery on the bottom. Left paying waay too much money for crappy food and service. Also was grossed out and didn't eat for the rest of the day. AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COST.]
