[102260952378245859593,100817393292341087607,I was pleasantly surprised to see so many good reviews from an auto shop place, 28/30 Zagat wow.... Highly disappointed was I. Everytime I called to ask some questions they made me feel like I needed to hurry up with my questions. I ignored it thought well maybe it was nothing. I come in to get a simple brake check, no work at all just a check. It took 2 hours and I had an appointment so I should be ahead of walk ins, and 1 or 2 people got oil changes and left before they finished with me; ridiculous! During my long wait everytime the customer came in the guy at the counter got so flustered and always saying "Why do you people always have to come in without appointment and expect to actually get your car done right away!" No respect for the customer at all! Finally after ,y brake check was finally done, they say its going to cost $1200. Holy Crap! what?! $140 for front brakes $90 labor, $40 for each rotor turn, $25 for brake caliper each $53 labor, $43 for brake hardware each $32 labor, $88 for back brake shoes $74 labor, $41 for a wheel cylinder each, whatever that is $52 labor, $40 drum hardware for shoes $32 labor, $40 drum turns each, $10 brake cleaning, $30 brake flush $68 labor, TOTAL IS - $1210 about ARE YOU KIDDING ME! Guess what I bough brakes with all the hardware for $38 some nice Bendix ones that came with all the parts and hardware i needed, amazing I just saved over $1100 dollars so far, go here if you like throwing money down the toilet, but the pricing is BEYOND ridiculous, don't even get me started on the 5 nails I mysteriously have all of a sudden in two of my tires....]
