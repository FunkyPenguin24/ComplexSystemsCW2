[103249043486934289076,100086729351489624540,My husband and I are regulars or have been for the past few months after finding Ichiban. Since they have a little bit of everything, we both enjoy the General Tso's chicken, sushi & sushimi and I'm "gaga" over the Crab rangoon. I can't wait for my next trip back.]
