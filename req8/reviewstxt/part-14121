[104090270758321392285,100918631830736327556,I have a Moto X and I was messing around with the accessibility settings and really screwed up my phone to the point that it was unusable. So I called Sprint national tech support and talked to 2 tech reps and they tried but couldn't help over the phone. They recommended I take it to my local Sprint store that does repair and recommended I go to the Tyrone store because it is a Sprint corporate site. But, instead I went to the Sprint Maycon store at US 19 in Pinelllas Park where I bought the phone, and much closer to home, and they were very helpful and courteous. Took 10 minutes max, phone fixed, I'm happy, highly recommend.]
