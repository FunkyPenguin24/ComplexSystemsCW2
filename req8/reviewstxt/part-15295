[100925560926750331358,100982233382062349659,This is the first time I've ever posted a comment. I've always had great service at this Verizon store. I'm prone to losing my phone often (I'm on phone 5 in two years) and they've always been great at switching my services to my "backup" phone and then to my next phone. I have nothing bad to say about the staff. They were even the one that recommended an inexpensive smart phone for the transition period. Even recommended the place where I purchased it (CPR Cell New Tampa). Two doors down I purchased a Droid X with charger for $50. I work from home which gives me the luxury to visit the store during business hours so there isn't a lot of customers and I get right in and out. I came in late one evening and the place was swamped. It took longer than expected but they were still giving everyone efficient service. Selfishly, I would have preferred they move everyone through like cattle through a chute and then take their time with me but that's not the staff's fault. Management might want to staff up a little heavier in the evenings.]
