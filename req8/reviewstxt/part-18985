The food is fresh and the desert (frozen yogurt) is included. Sandwiches are always stacked. Salad bar is unique and awesome. Food is great for the healthy eater...problem is i just eat to health of a portion when there. Note that baked lays are available substitute for those who don't want the standard chips or a bowl of fruit. Only thing i did not like was the BBQ...but this is NC you don't got to Jason's for BBQ!!!:)]
