[116114394353931574229,100016577944165714592,I should have read the reviews posted on several websites before traveling 2 hours to visit Nitsas with my daughter. It was a complete waste of time. My daughter was shopping for a wedding dress. We tried to make an appointment the week before, however, we could not get anyone on the phone. So we decided to check it out anyway. They did not have one customer in the store and we were told that she could not try on any wedding dresses. Their was one employee at the register and three ladies in the back eating and talking. I explained that we tried to make an appointment and we had traveled quite a distance but she did not care. I own a large retail business and I would say this is the worst customer service I have personally encountered. The day ended well after visiting Hayden Olivia, where my daughter found her dress. I would not recommend this place to anyone.]
