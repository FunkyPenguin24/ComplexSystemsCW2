[102142341177655256839,100851971282590450522,Cool stuff - Pet show, pinapeds, turtles - don't miss the HUGE ones just outside the Shipwreck rapids. Shamu - Very disappointed - Trainers no longer enter tank with whales. The whole show is mostly splashing visitors. Dolphins - no jumping over things or through hoops. VERY heavily human acrobatics - very light on actual dolphin tricks. Cirque de la mar- SHUT DOWN - "Summer is over for that show" according to guest services (It's MID-AUGUST for crying-out-loud!) Everywhere: Baseball game style drink sellers "Peanuts!, get your peanuts!" Carnival ring tosses. Ug... Polar Explorer ride - VERY OLD technology. - unchanged in 15 years - Not even Hi-Def video. Weak. ShipWreck Rapids. 45 min wait, short, unsurprizing ride. Atlantis ride: 2 drops, some water, a long wait to exit... DONE. Aquarium: Fresh Water- Air Conditioning mostly broken.. very hot and stuffy. Parking - Expensive - Recommend parking outside, biking in. Several tables near bike racks near entrance for lunch. Put cold lunch in a cheap foam ice chest, leave on bikes... Bike racks not heavily used, not advertised on web site, not mentioned in phone messages, and very lightly commented on forums. We highly recommend the SD Zoo instead. Absolutely none of the issues above... A very class act up there... And you can bring your own lunch in: No problem and FREE parking.... Go EARLY though and see the Big Cat alley FIRST (they are asleep well before noon)]
