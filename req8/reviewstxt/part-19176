[106294537237024511223,100015314452285369496,I've spent a few nights here. And if I need a place to stay in Newcastle, I won't even look elsewhere. Staff are super friendly, the restaurant serves world class food, and they even have a small bar/nightclub on the property (Thirsty Thursday is the best night). As a previous rater said, it's geared towards the working man. But don't hold that against them. They also have a pond where you can feed the fish and turtles. Reasonable prices, clean rooms and wireless internet. What more does a person really need?]
