[109028719375147779568,101159849460327726302,Horrible customer service-Paid close to $70 for dinner and the portion size was smaller than lunch portions. When the bartender asked if we wanted a drink, the owner said no, they takeout only. I wanted a drink because I had already waited over an hour and i'm pregnant. They were under staffed and the bartender told me herself that they get their food 40% off and she still doesn't eat the food. The man sitting next to me at the bar got free booze and when I complained I got nothing, not even an apology. I ordered my food to go and also my friend too.We ordered 4 of the same entrees and our food was incorrect. The "shrimp" roll was actually "imitation crab ". I will never go back and don't recommend this place at all .]
