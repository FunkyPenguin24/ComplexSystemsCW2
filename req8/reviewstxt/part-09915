[103262836080252967481,100688795964982357890,I absolutely love this place! We are CSA members so we have free admission to everything all year long, get fresh produce (a lot) every weekend and it is a great variety. We love to stroll around and see the animals....Elmer is my personal favorite :) The winery is across the street and CSA members get free wine tastings as well (they can choose 3). The view is amazing from the winery deck! For 6 people, the CSA is about $450 for the whole season which works out to about $75/person to experience everything they have there, get free wine tastings, get fresh produce PLUS free bonus picks every week all season long! This also includes the free member pancake breakfasts that they put on every so often and all special events. This may just be my favorite place on earth!]
