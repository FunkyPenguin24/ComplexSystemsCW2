[113839184245772996977,100513204432923909278,My experience at the perfect dress was AMAZING!!! Robyn helped me find a BEAUTIFUL wedding gown in my budget a month before my wedding. Because of the time crunch, I was shocked that she was able to fit me in with a great seamstress and got my dress finished in 1 week!!! I am so happy with my dress and had excellent service! I would recommend anyone looking for a wedding, prom or special event dress to check with The Perfect Dress! =)]
