[113405728222911992549,101064012158458089348,I went to Sunday brunch and found it to be a child care center. Children came in noisy and were running around. We moved to another part of the restaurant and it was still disturbing. The manager came over and kinda of apologized but said - that's just how it is for brunch now, you know? Actually, I didn't know because I go to brunch often and that has never happened before. It won't happen again for me or anyone I know at the Cecil. That's just how it is now, you know?]
