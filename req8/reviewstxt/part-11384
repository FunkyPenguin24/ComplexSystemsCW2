[106479006276177438807,100768052263728470141,I'm not a ribs fan, but the ribs at this place are really good. Nice and lean, good flavour, good portions. Wings are fall-off-the-bone and really tasty as well, but not quite my style for wings. Skip the fries - they're not the stars of the show. We will go back, more likely for takeout than eating on site, but the service was very nice, helpful and cheerful.]
