[112023060252382578987,100382464339050119433,Went shopping for a new car and ultimately decided on a Chevy Volt (which I love). I'm not an impulse buyer and took months to decide and shopped. Everett, was the internet contact I first hooked up with and he provided information for months without the "you must buy now" I kept hearing from other dealerships. They spent a lot of time with me educating me on the car. Still, when it came down to negotiating, I went to several dealers. One claimed to beat any other deal by $750, but they didn't. One gave me a price they didn't honor. One gave me a great price under the condition I complete the GM survey "completely satisfied," which I felt unethical. Al Serra Chevrolet matched the price, let me take the car home overnight, and then honored the price they gave. They made the paperwork easy and then went over the specifics of the Volt. I did something stupid and forgot to apply $456 in GM Mastercard rewards to the car and they couldn't have been nicer about applying the rewards and sending me the check. Bottom line is that Everett and everyone at Al Serra shined way above the other dealers I worked with. My experience with Al Serra Chevrolet (North location) was top notch.]
