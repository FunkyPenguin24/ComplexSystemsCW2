[102453094242140659670,100433407555698445990,The cashew almond chicken was delicious and the portion was generous. But I ordered on the phone and when I came in to pick up my food (11pm on a Friday night) no one greeted me at the front or asked if I needed help while I waited there for 20 mins. I had to flag down one of the passing servers to get them to show me where to pick up my food (at the bar -- how was I supposed to know that?). The experience at Cheesecake Factory was much more organized. They told me where to pick up my food (at the Bakery) and called out my order when it was ready. That being said, the food -- once I found it -- was ready when they said it would be and the price was reasonable.]
