[105324983353025435324,101101591504824518254,At first the customer service was top notch, the appraiser was prompt and courteous. The dish pack we ordered went perfectly, the movers arrived and everything went quickly. But all did not end well. I have an antique dresser with a marble top, it's well over 100 years old. At some point in it's history the marble top was broken and repaired. There is a proper way to handle marble. Unfortunately the Daryl Flood movers did not take the proper care, which resulted in the marble top snapping in two right along the original break. Now I have owned this piece for over 10 years, and it's been moved at least seven times, and there has never been a problem. I got a repair quote, filed a claim with Daryl Flood, and they rejected it saying it was broken before the move? What!? I replied back via email to the claims adjuster and simply stated this was not acceptable and if they did not rectify the situation then I'd have to leave them some bad reviews. 3 weeks have past, and still no reply..]
