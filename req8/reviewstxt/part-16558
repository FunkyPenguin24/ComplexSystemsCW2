[117130957625846981973,101050526903194222834,The office wasnt occupied twice during the 3 months i had an RV stored there, once when we went to get into the storage yard, to get to our, trailer there was a sign on the office door, said out to lunch, BE BACK AT !:15, we waited there, for 45 mins., called thier off property phone number posted on thier front window, no answer, voice mail only, no way to get ahold of ANYONE, this happened to us twic e!! Then when we spoke with a man who worked there and said he was the MANAGER, he was combatitive with us, didnt want to hear any of our concerns, or never apologized for our inconviences, he was rude , told us we had to move our trailer anyway, because he was cleaning up the yard, and that he was cutting down the tree our trailer was sitting under, then when we told him we had enough we were moving out on the first he changed his tune, said we didnt have to move our trailer today, he would call us in a few days and let us know when to move it,[],he never did call us,[], we had paid our rent up till 7-1-13, but we went and took our trailer out of there on the 26th of june, The office help there has had 3 different employees come and go since we signed on with them, they gave us a gate code to get into the yard whenever we needed to, the code doesnt work, you have to wait for someone in the office to come out and unlock the gate,[],[],if theres anyone there at all,[],[],definitly would not reccomend this place, very UNPROFESSIONAL, AND RUDE!!!!!!!, Never mind the fact that my husband is an disabled vet., but we were customers, and paid them to be treated like crap!!!!]
