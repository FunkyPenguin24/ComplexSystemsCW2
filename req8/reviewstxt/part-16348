[114068562877309302529,101039286724329620570,I moved from MA to VA and needed to store everything from my house for a few months. The space provided was the right size, clean and easy to access. There were moving carts available to help move in all of my stuff. The staff was friendly and helpful. The security seems thorough. I would recommend extra space storage.]
