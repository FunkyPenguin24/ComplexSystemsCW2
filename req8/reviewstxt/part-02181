[100193844893666835221,100271568319211152100,I've been to Cafe Intermezzo three times now and I'll never go back. Tonight was their final chance and they blew it. The food is decent, but way overpriced. For $29, my wife and I got a crepe, hot chocolate and cheesecake. But that's not where CI fails... we had a party of 6 and when two of our group went to the restroom, the hostess tried to take half our table before we were finished! She didn't even ask if we were done, nor did she apologize. She just disgustedly pushed it back and watched us chat hoping we would leave. We also had to ask our waitress for more drinks / water numerous times. Final straw was the 40 minutes it took them to get our cheesecake to us. Never again.]
