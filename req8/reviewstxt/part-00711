[102215797145750613295,100196584571326242527,Charley was very helpful in finding health care for me as an individual in the $100/month price range. He went over 3 options surrounding that price mark in an unbiased manner and allowed me to choose the best plan for my personal situation. That being said, I am lucky in that I have no pre-existing conditions. Reading the previous reviews, I find it unfortunate that Mr. Mallon would throw himself more in line with the insurance providers than the clients he serves. I believe it is an unfortunate state of our society that insurance companies want to know of a client's pre-existing condition up to 10 years back! I can understand 6 months, but anything more than that is a ploy to charge higher premiums to less fortunate individuals. But, for my fortunate circumstances, Charley proved very helpful. I'll put the blame on the system over the individual who has to work in it.]
