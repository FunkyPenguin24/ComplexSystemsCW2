[107875865239572803712,101133147179862563228,I highly recommend Patrick Pedano of The Stange Law Firm without question. Patrick impeccably handled every aspect of my complex family litigation with compassion, understanding and great attention to detail to protect my and my children's future including: moving my case from Illinois to Missouri, discovering assets of a self-employed ex-spouse, modification of child support and visitation, understanding sensitive and important issues with a special needs child through to enforcement of the court order. I never once questioned his commitment to my case or his vast knowledge of current family law. Patrick prepared me for every step of the process, kept me up to date and in the loop via both phone and email. At each meeting my goals and the best interest of my children were always kept in the forefront. It's a great piece of mind to know that Patrick and his expertise are there for my family when we need it!]
