[101627831008653509216,100372960799268128779,I first went to this restaurant with a few of my friends and I loved the atmosphere from the start and it was a plus that the food was delicious....being from Yonkers and Mexican American I know my mexican food pretty well as well as trying every mexican restaurant/taco shack in the area. I decided to have a dinner party for birthday at Guapo's and I have to say the service was great the food was excellent and all my friends enjoyed themselves. IT WAS GREAT!! My friends and I will deff come back more often to this place in the future. Great Prices Great Food and Great Service and great drinks as well hehehe!]
