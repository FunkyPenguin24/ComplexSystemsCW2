[109498425745123260579,100758626658617090236,This place is the best! They fast-tracked the repair previously replaced iPad digitizer from another Pod Drop location that was not functioning. Not only did they cover the 2nd repair fully, they got it done on a Saturday in under 2 hours. After a week of a wonky screen and then total failure, having my iPad back that quick was beyond my expectations. I will be utilizing the Madison Heights Pod Drop solely for any repairs from now on. Thanks guys!]
