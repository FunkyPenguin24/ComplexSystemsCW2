[107360901064276647917,100862659165035004876,Ate here last last saturday, OUTSTANDING! I had the Mahi Loco Moco and one macadamia nut pancake, I tried all the syrups, my favorite was the coconut!!! The Mahi was grilled, seasoned perfectly and was fresh!! My friend had the Spam Loco Moco and loved it! Clean, Fast Service, Delish food!! I was very impressed!! We have high standards in our own family run cafe, so my standards are a bit high and I just can't say enough great things about this restaurant!! Keep up the great work Ken's!!]
