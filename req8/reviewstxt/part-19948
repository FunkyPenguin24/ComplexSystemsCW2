[100255959017374142577,100057057413985433924,2:06 P.M. ANOTHER UPDATE: OKAY, I CALLED AT 7:30 A.M. AND IT IS 2:06 AND THE MANAGER--NICOLE HAS NOT CALLED ME BACK. SO, AN UPSET CUSTOMER AND NOT ONE WORD FROM MANAGEMENT. IT HAS BEEN HOURS. THIS IS UNPROFESSIONAL. I HAVE BEEN VERY POLITE AND NOT ONE RESPONSE PHONE CALL. I CALLED AVEDA CORPORATE AND THEY SAID THIS IS A PRIVATELY OWNED SALON AND THEREFORE THEY CANNOT DO ANYTHING. SOMEONE OUGHT TO LET THEM KNOW THAT LETTING SOMEONE HANG FOR THIS LONG IS VERY DISRESPECTFUL. I HAVE ZERO ISSUES WITH WRITING THIS KIND OF REVIEW AT THIS POINT. IF YOU HAVE A COMPLAINT THESE FOLKS DO NOTHING TO RECTIFY THE SITUATION. 11:36 A.M. This is an update, and I will continue to update--depending on what the salon does. I am asking that Aveda please call me back. I have a call into Nicole and she is going to call me back this afternoon. I spoke to one gentleman and he was very nice. I am certain that the salon will do the right thing. When they do, I will write a glowing review. Let us see what they decide to do. I wonder if they can put hair back on! 7:30 A.M. Hello Columbus. I had the single worst haircut I have ever received from this salon. I asked to have 1/4 inch off of my hair. I asked that the stylist put in long layers and long bangs. Throughout the haircut, she kept telling me that she could not see my hair. You see, she had blown it out so she could cover the mess she had made. I could see it and had to cut the haircut short, so I would not walk out with even shorter hair. The right side of my hair has layers and the left side of my hair does not. The right side is exactly two inches shorter than the rest of my hair. The solution she had was to keep cutting my hair off. She just kept cutting. Then she suggested I just wear my hair back. "Just pull your hair back." She looked on the floor and said "wow we took alot of hair off". I was polite, I left a tip (everyone needs to eat), and I left. This is not my first bad experience there. Overall, their service is terrible. They do not follow-up, they do not offer a refund, and they do not ever try to fix things. Cutting more hair off is not a solution. I have a huge meeting in about ten minutes and I would like Nurtur the Salon to know that I have, in fact, pulled my hair into a ponytail, because that is currently the only solution. I am heartbroken. I have never left a review of any product or service in my life. I have never taken the time to do so. I would warn anyone from going there. I apologize, in advance, for writing a review this scathing. I am just that dissatisfied with their work, and I have been to two people there. I let the first disaster go. I thought it was just a fluke. I will say that their waxing team is excellent and I cannot speak to their other services. They appear to not care, and they are not going to call me back or fix this. BTW, the only solution is a full bob or hair extensions. A bob is not an option. I am so sorry to all the folks who make their living there. I am not a mean person. I just do not want anyone to feel like I feel now.]
