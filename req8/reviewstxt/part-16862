[100000987019913839217,101066600647461085178,This was my favorite Local post office until I tried submitting my passport. This location usually has friendlier people, you always have the staff who stand there and don't help or see the line and close their register because it's union break time but all in all the staff that works here doesn't seem to hate people. (I know thats a wonderful yard stick to evaluate my service but it's the reality of the postale system). The problem with this location is that it is now the location for the Passport processing and the staff they have performing that function seem to over dramatize the process and be very uniformed. They rejected perfectly good photos that we're accepted by the Ocala post office and then again by the Passport agency. If there is only one place in town that performs this function they really should be able to do the job properly.]
