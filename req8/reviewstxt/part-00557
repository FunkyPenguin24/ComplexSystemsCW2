[110209753707193146522,100188315057133073297,Went in over the weekend to see about renting a space for a family member moving this way. The overall experience was outstanding. Also, some of the best customer service I've dealt with when it comes to public storage in general. The Sales Representative, Mark, was very easy to approach as well as very knowledgeable about the array of storage spaces available and answered all my questions with ease. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking into renting a storage space.]
