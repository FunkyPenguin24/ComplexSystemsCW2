[108741565480066652893,100706302821558428993,I have been in Austin for 17+ years. KB is not Starbucks. It feels much more like an Austin local coffee shop, and that is how I like it. There are many events hosted in the shop so you can not always keep sitting and read your books. On the other hand, I feel they are trying to be/provide a local community hub, and I like it. Both coffee and tea are very decent. I just tried their pizza. It was actually pretty good... Due to its location, it is not yet overpopulated by studying students. It actually does feel like a coffee shop :) It is pretty loud during event, but pretty quiet otherwise. Just be aware of events (there is a calendar on their web page).]
