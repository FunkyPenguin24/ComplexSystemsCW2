[108189447836686034611,100373011921179160688,Took my car in to Just Brakes in Frisco yesterday. This is a high-mileage vehicle and some places look at high-mileage as high-profit. Joshua did an excellent job of looking the car over and offering suggestions. No high-pressure sales tactics, just "this is what's broken" and "this is what I'd also think about fixing". Since I use Just Brakes exclusively for my brake work, he was able to pull up the service history and was able to warranty repair some of the work, saving me hundreds. I know a little something about cars and these guys are good. A complete new team hand-picked by the new store manager just a few months ago. Definitely going back.]
