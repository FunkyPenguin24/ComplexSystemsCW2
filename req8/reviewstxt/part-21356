[100129006225935855310,100132048453108664130,Michael must have had a crab up his bumm to leave that review! I have been going to this place since it opened... as a lifetime rockland resident take it from me... this place is all around good. Clean, friendly and if you know buffets... don't be an idiot.... show up early or yes you may have stuff that sat in the steam tables for a while. It is common sense!]
