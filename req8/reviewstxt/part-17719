[102541920830477421728,101115194915748524307,Had a great time at my first class. Alex, despite being relatively young, ran a great class. He was confident, helpful, and gave easy to follow instructions. Great anaerobic intensity from a workout standpoint. I can tell I'm going to enjoy Krav Maga in general because of its practicality, real-world (as opposed to tournament) application, and sheer physicality. No kid-stuff here. Alex had us learning techniques within the first half-hour, including simple choke defenses and emotional "on/off switch" exercises. The facility is nice, despite smelling like a well-used locker room after the class. The 16-20 of us in the room worked up a pretty good sweat, collectively. As a martial arts noob, I also appreciated the congenial and encouraging atmosphere. The more experienced students are friendly and eager to sub-coach you through the techniques. Price seemed a little steep at first, but that's just compared to your run-of-the-mill gym membership. It's pretty competitive when I put it up against other martial arts gyms, LA boxing, etc. Bottom line... I'm getting an annual membership.]
