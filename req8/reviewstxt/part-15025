[106916307038655335601,100968183304723272040,I brought my laptop in for repairs. I waited over 15 minutes fand one of the 4 men I I could see there in the department ever looked up and even acknowledged my existence. I finally went up to one of them and said, 'Excuse me, am I waiting in the right place for service and repairs?" He did not look up, he just mumbled, "yes." Another 5 minutes and someone came to help me. That's PATHETIC. Customer Service 101 says, acknowledge the customer and say, "We'll be right with you." And then acutally be right with them.
