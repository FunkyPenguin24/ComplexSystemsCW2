[116715719176858777722,100363857126850597145,I am a local and got the opportunity to dine at this lovely place in what I would normally consider a gross tourist trap that is the armpit of the city. Bourbon Street is usually a place you can't drag me to but this was a refreshing spot to enter. Nice people, beautiful on the inside, multilevel space and lots of room. The prices were very reasonable and I ended up getting the alligator bites for appetizer - half fried and half blackened. The blackened were very salty but the fried make me want to return for an alligator poboy. I had the praline duck for an entree and it was amazing, along with the service. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. A true gem among the flash and trash of Bourbon.]
