[101700554312246374506,101147557717030757154,So, customer service has always been terrible here. But today, we got a kids pizza for my 3 year old daughter...and we discovered this metal rivet right on top of the pizza in the container. We called and let them know we'd be returning to show them and get the meal erased. But when we arrived we got the run around for half an hour and were forced to call the owner ourselves because the crew claimed they couldn't refund for anything more than the pizza. The owner, Ryan Morrison, belatedly accepted my call tonight and promised to make it right tomorrow. This should have been an easy fix. Nobody charges you after almost choking your child.]
