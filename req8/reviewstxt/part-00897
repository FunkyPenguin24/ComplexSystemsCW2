[103029062278840823935,100205595289236754826,Now that Borders is gone, B&N is the best bookstore in the South Bend, Indiana area. They have a great reading area and a comprehensive periodical section. The staff has always been helpful and very knowledgeable. This location does offer a Starbucks licensed (not the same as a Starbucks) cafe. Wireless connectivity can be unreliable. Parking at the University Park Mall must have been designed by someone with a sick sense of humor or total incompetence since getting in and out is beyond challenging during busy times.]
