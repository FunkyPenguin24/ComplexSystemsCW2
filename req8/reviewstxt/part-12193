[107412117613942111585,100811498622114090089,My wife and I were looking for a new van in January. We found one at Fury in Stillwater. Ryan found us the perfect van. It had all the features we wanted and more, it was newer and lower miles than what we had been looking at. Although the price was higher than what we had planed on, they were able to get us better financing rates and terms than what we were able to get through our credit union. Our experience at Fury was great! Fury Stillwater is a great location for us, conveniently located. I have had my other vehicles serviced here as well. They have done great work for me and my wife!]
