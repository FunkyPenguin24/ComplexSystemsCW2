[104291105960530935901,100574137173495447082,This is probably the dirtiest and most poorly maintained gym I've ever been to. The staff simply does not care about the condition of the place and it shows in every possible aspect. Broken equipment often takes months to fix. Water fountains routinely have problems and don't get fixed. The locker rooms are simply disgusting...dirty towels on the floor, hair everywhere, broken urinals, mold all over the showers. Before I started my last workout, somebody had vomited in one of the sinks. An hour and a half later, it was still sitting there. Besides the condition of the place, nobody on staff seems to care that the equipment is abused and almost never returned to its appropriate place. As a result, good luck finding dumbells you need...most times, I end up walking around the floor searching for one or both. They don't have enough clips for all of their barbells so there's a good chance you'll be using a barbell with loose plates on the end. Even pull-cord extensions (rope, bars, etc.) get misplaced and you'll have a hard time finding what you're looking for in any kind of efficient way. It's simply not a well-run place at all. They seem to care about bringing in new clients as they will have anywhere from 3 to 5 salespeople working at all times. Despite this, there's apparently nobody responsible for managing the freeweight areas, taking notes on broken equipment, or even taking an occasional look in the locker rooms to make sure they don't present a health hazard. (They do at most times of the day.)]
