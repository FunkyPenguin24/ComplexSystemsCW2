[101979198491725696692,100988572191356028087,I am a huge Indian food fan - I went with a vegan friend to check this place out. A week after Valentines day the Valentines day decor was still up. Our waiter - who was probably a manager or owner as we saw him in back often barking at his kitchen staff - took time to go over the extremely extensive menu with us. My friend is sensitive to spicy food so he made a recommendation based on her requirements. The meal she received was too spicy for her so we asked if she could receive a replacement. Our waiter said no problem but he first wanted to taste the dish.....I said sure. He placed the dish on the neighboring table, took a forkful, looked at us and said "it's not spicy." He and I discussed, for much longer that we should have (the discussion should have never taken place) how people have different tolerances. He went back to the kitchen and quickly returned with a 'less spicy' version of the dish - which, we found, was simply more of the same dish. You may ask "why are you going to an Indian restaurant when you can't handle spice" but I think you have to agree his methodology in handling the situation was absurd. The naan was great, my butter chicken tasted tomato-y - like it was poured out of a can. I hope this place closes down again.]
