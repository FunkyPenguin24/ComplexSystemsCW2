[105581020091271244356,100223868683613829331,Coniglio Chiropractic is a wonderful chiropractic office. I have been adjusted by chiropractors for over 15 years--from all across the US (from Pennsylvania to Chicago to Denver to Los Angeles), including being adjusted by master trainers/teachers from the Chicago School of Chiropractic Medicine. Given all of this experience I have to rate Dr. Coniglio at the top very 1% of all chiropractors I've ever seen. His adjustments are so thorough, so complete, and done with such great care. He is truly a one-of-a-kind master chiropractor. When I moved to the South Jersey area I needed a chiropractor to manage my long-term (often times tricky) chronic lower back condition, and Dr. Barry Coniglio was there to help. By chance I stumbled upon his office, and to this day I am so grateful for all the wonderful care he (and his office staff, including Donna) have given me. For anyone new to the area, or looking for a professional, friendly, and extremely competent chiropractor--look no further. Call Dr. Coniglio TODAY! It will be the best decision you've ever made. Sincerely, Gregory D. Benjamin, Ph.D., M.P.H.]
