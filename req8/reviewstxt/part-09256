[110733174487679732937,100652753643858429577,I was very impressed with the neatness of the facility and the presentation of the cars on the showroom floor. I found it very easy to work with Mike H., as he answered all my questions in a positive manner. That is appreciated from a customer viewpoint. The price offered on my trade in (2003 Silverado LTD Diesel) was very fair. Picked the new vehicle up the next at the time as promised. Mike went over all of the various functions and got the OnStar up and running. Overall great experience and I would recommend the dealership to anyone without any reservations. Thanks Rick]
