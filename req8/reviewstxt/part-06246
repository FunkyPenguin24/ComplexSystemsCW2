[102553361154231324832,100489662502969193658,I ordered online and had waited about an hour wondering where my pizza was. Then I checked my email which told me "Your pizza will be at your house in 120-130min". There is no reason it should take 2 hours to recieve a pizza after ordering it. Then when I called to ask what the long wait was for, I got nothing but snobby remarks and I was hung up on. Be careful with this one. The food was tasty but my pizza was practically cold when it got to my house.]
