[115726328800078801971,100495257129323762052,BEWARE! They are incompetent and dishonest. After mis-diagnosing my car and charging me over $1700 my car is still not fixed. They refuse to give me a refund or repair it properly. Check their bad records with the better business bureau and the state attorney general. Save your money, go elsewhere!]
