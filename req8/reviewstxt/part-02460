[104841935574367440725,100285786566667883978,this is an amazing little restaurant for such a small town. Clearly authentic Italian cuisine, amazing desserts and an outstanding little coffee shop in the front part of the restaurant. This is not your chain generic Italian food--this is authentic cuisine. And not only that the only Italian restaurant in town that serves great wine with your meal. Wonderful service-- It's like having a 5 star restaurant in Ottawa! I eat there whenever I am in town.]
