[107846383570146165666,101129401523341421617,I've been to alot of car dealerships, most of them pushy and just wanting to "make the sale" - not this dealership. Throughout my visit I was assisted by Craig. He was incredibly friendly, actually LISTENED to what I wanted, and most importantly, didn't pressure me into a sale that I wasn't completely sure of. I walked in the door with the intent of buying a moderately priced used vehicle, and ended up driving away in a brand new vehicle that I wouldn't have even considered if Craig hadn't suggested it. Not only am I happy about my sale, I'm confident in it. I'm so happy with my purchase. I'd recommend this place to anyone! :)]
