First, it took being on hold for over 20 minutes to get an appointment. Then, another 20 minutes to re-confirm that appointment at their request. Once there, we waited an hour past our scheduled time before finally giving up this practice for good. ProTip: If you can't even manage your patient's scheduling right, how can we expect you to manage our dental care in even half a decent way?]
