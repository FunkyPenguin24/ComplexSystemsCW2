[100258370930410743824,100861105105962757394,my girlfriend and were craving sushi like no other, and took our first trip to Hapi Sushi in Laguna Beach. The place is old and homely, but the chef is very friendly and even made us custom rolls since my girlfriend is very picky about her sushi. The rolls were delicious and different that anything I've had in orange county. We stayed for 2 hours until closing, and they didn't once try to push us out the door like i've read about at places like mosun. we arrived at 8pm on a saturday night, and were served immediately. The #69 roll with strawberry is amaaaaaaazing! the japanese burrito roll is straight up EXOTIC. these guys are ahead of the game and very creative with their sushi. They've been in laguna beach for over 20 years, and the chef is a master sushi chef without a doubt. This is by no means so trendy sushi joint that distracts you with fancy decor while mexicans make your sushi.]
