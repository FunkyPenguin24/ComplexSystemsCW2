[105111639089907640542,100423355200256084547,My husband Dennis Robinson and I, went down over the week end of June 14th and June 15th of this year to do some research on Billy the Kid. What a wonderful museum and so full of knowledge. We spent several hours visiting with the owner and he was so knowledgeable. I would recommend this museum to anyone who really wants to know about Billy the Kid. The museum was laid out in history form by dates of occurrence and was so clean and well organized. Enjoyed the video about Billy the Kid. Want to know history..go to the source. He's gone but his memory still lives on there in Fort Sumner.]
