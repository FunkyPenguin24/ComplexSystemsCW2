[111295173257327136092,100568225893615457713,Okay, my wife and I went to a restaurant called "Shout" in downtown Atlanta last night. Valet (AmeriPark) took my truck and drove away. After dinner they returned my vehicle with a dent in my bumper and fender. I asked the valet what happened they said that they did not cause the damages, nor our they liable for any damages. So, I called the police and they arrived. I asked the restaurant how they could help and they said that the Valet company was a contractor for the property and had nothing to do with the restaurant. DO NOT USE THE VALET SERVICE!!!]
