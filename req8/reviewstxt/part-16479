[100121909835142104041,101045912998364999095,Wretchedly Poor - Showed up with my mother who is bipolar along with other undiagnosed problems and in desperate need of help. We arrived at just about 2pm. There were 3 people in the waiting room. Over the next 3 hours they were all seen. My mother was finally seen at 11:30pm. Apparently a bunch of employees were sick and did not come in to work according to the desk. They also blamed computer problems. So instead of letting us know the last case worker that was in had left and another would not be in until 11pm they just let us sit there and gave us attitude when we would ask for an update saying they were having computer problems and employees calling in sick. They knew full well that their was no case worker there to see my mother and they made us wait for nearly 10 hours. I know the mental health field is terribly underfunded but I am just saying that when you have people in mental distress maybe you should be straight with them and not lie or mislead them. I had to keep my mother there for all that time because after the first 6 hours of waiting do you think there is any chance I could have ever gotten her to go back? Her assessment was also done in under 20 minutes after we were told it usually takes about an hour. If you have money pay for a psychologist or doctor before you go to this place. If you have no money and mental health issues I am sincerely sorry if you have to go here.]
