[102144136274563805997,101043191589200567378,Food was good enough, service was terrible! We waited long enough to look at the menus and decide on dinner before anyone even said hello. When a waitress finally came to our table she took our drink order and zipped off before we could even tell her we were ready to order dinner. She did not make conversation at all, and let our drinks get empty before she checked on us again, and forgot the refills we asked for. The burgers were hot and good enough for bar food but service ruined the experience.]
