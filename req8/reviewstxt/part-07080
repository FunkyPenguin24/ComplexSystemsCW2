[105796667694022952311,100536087932694017934,After finding camping in March isn't a good option around Cortez(KOA closed, NP closed) I started calling motels late Saturday night trying to find something that fit into our "camping" vacation budget. White Eagle was $45 which was almost half of the other chain motels around here. It was out of town a bit so I thought the GPS was lost but what a gem when we got here. It is VERY well kept and the lady at the desk treated me like family. I don't remember when I have stayed in a place that is this clean. By-pass the big name places...this is the place to stay!!]
