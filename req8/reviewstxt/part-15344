[111865966693549213759,100984418370944965348,I am not one to normally leave negative reviews, but considering what this office has done.. I would NEVER recommend this place for orthodontic treatment. After over a year of my daughter wearing braces, we went to her scheduled monthly visit last week just to be told they will NO longer treat her because they have decided to "not" accept her insurance from this point on. No advance warning.. NOTHING! I kept my daughter home from school, drove 45 minutes & sat in the lobby almost 2 hours waiting, before they even told me! Not to mention, they would not even tighten her braces while we were there. When I asked Jen (office manager) about this, her response was that it's ok to go up to 12 weeks without treatment. REALLY??? So it's OK to put metal in a child's mouth & then decide you no longer want to finish the job, therefore leaving the parents to find a resolution. The excuse is they are not happy with the insurance company, so they decided to throw in the towel, per Jen.. This office took NO blame on their part whatsoever.... nor could/would recommend what to do from this point other tell each parent effected to contact the insurance company for answers. Even the insurance company has been shocked by this. They have documentation of payments paid up to date.. I posted a comment regarding this situation on Suncoast Braces Facebook page, which by that evening was deleted. I guess they only want the positive comments to be seen. They have been unprofessional is so many ways! I could never trust them after this.]
