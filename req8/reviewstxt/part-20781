Blend is an inviting, bright, clean and friendly place to work, meet friends or to simply enjoy a moment alone whilst enjoying one of the many treats on their varied daily menus. You can kick back in one of their comfy upholstered retro chairs with a great cuppa (bliss!), take the children to enjoy the great roomy space at the back of the cafe or visit with family or friends for a delicious lunch. If you're in the area, and even if you're not, this is one place worth going out of your way to visit - it's an absolute joy!]
