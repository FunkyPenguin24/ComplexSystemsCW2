[106193915126845939865,100205674580938200591,Our group went to Lipstick Dallas last week & found out they now offer free cover everyday till 1pm which is good. The place has been cleaned up & has new dancers & waitresses also a few new managers. You cant beat the long happy hour till 9pm everyday with $2 beers & $2.50 wells. We know Lipstick is not a highend Club although it has a laid back feel to it where you dont get hasseled by high priced dancers bugging you for $$$. We noticed there were food menus on each table with lots to choose from so we took a change on strip club food & must say were impressed. Nachos, tacos even steak was good. To sum it up we were there for 4 hours & had a great time, we will be back. Keep in mind the negative reviews for Lipstick here our 2 years old & this Club has changed for the better so you have to see for yourself.]
