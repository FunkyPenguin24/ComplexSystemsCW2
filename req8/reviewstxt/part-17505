[113011649445088212596,101103202234086518843,Great service, friendly people, oil changed in less than an hour @ $36. I must say the $99 internet advertisement for my 20K mile checkup scared me in as much as it was redundantly repeating the same simple tasks every way it could as if too make a big deal out of normal low skill owner tasks of air pressure, tire ware, brakes, fluid levels, wipers, horn, and light bulbs. Do I really need an auto mechanic for mundane tasks on a newish vehicle and especially when the vehicle computer tells me about tire pressure and other problems anyway?]
