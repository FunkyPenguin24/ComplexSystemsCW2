[114025829716539687349,100244038082895985878,I donâ€™t know if the community realizes how very blessed we are to have Dr. Patel and his staff to serve us. I've found myself in many Dr. offices translating for old friends and new ones alike, but never have I witnessed the passion and commitment....the caring and sincerity that I have in his office. My son is 22 and has visited the emergency room too many times to count, just to be turned away. I didn't realize a 2 cm kidney stone was not an emergency situation! My son lost all hope and was ready to give up. He came to visit last week. We spent the night in yet another hospital...just to be sent home with Ibuprofen. He cried on that bed..feeling his body "dying" as he would say. The next morning..I went into Dr. Patel's office without an appointment. He was in surgery and would be off the rest of the week. Mind you...my son has never been seen by him. One of the girls at the front desk sent Dr. Patel a text and we quickly heard back from him. He needed to know if my son ate anything that day...and asked that I don't feed him. My son broke in tears feeling hope for the 1st time in a very long time. My baby was in the surgery room by 1:50 pm that same day. I FIND NO WORDS TO DESCRIBE MY GRATITUDE! My baby has a second chance at living a normal life. THANK YOU Dr. Patel!!! You are amazing....and your team is unbelievable!!!]
