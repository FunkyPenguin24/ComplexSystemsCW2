[117413687023312683446,101156287671894904428,We reserved a week ahead for 8 people. I got the Bison Ribs, the Venison, the half quail and the beef cheeks, and everything was perfectly prepared, perfectly plated, and tasted amazing. Our waiter was very nice, and even let me know that it would take slightly longer for my plates to get to the table since i'd ordered all meat, which was fine by me! And man was it worth the wait. My last plate was the Bison Ribs, and they were perfectly seasoned, and fell apart in my plate. VERY delicious and tender. A MUST for Spanish tapas in Montreal.]
