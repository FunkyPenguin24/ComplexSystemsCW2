[115152267729561679893,100798497745790193047,Been bringing my Lab there for years and never had a bad experience. Always accommodating, friendly and reasonably priced. Plus, unlike many "chain" kennels I've looked at in the Norwalk/Stamford area, they don't charge extra for bringing your own food for the dog (seriously, some places do), giving medications, or letting your pooch out in the yard to play with other dogs once or twice a day. Unlike Camp Bow Wow, they don't make you pay in advance for stays during peak times of the year or not refund you if you have to cancel at the last-minute. Two paws up, Passage East!]
