[100060334350346730154,100077206753915182395,Me and two girlfriends ate here yesterday evening by accident. We planned to go to Raku, but I guess it's closed...? Oops. But anyways, It was around 6:00 pm so there wasn't a crowd. The atmosphere is inviting and the decor is modern and vibrant. The server was friendly and fairly knowledgeable. We had the Firenze Pizza (mushroom and sausage), the Brooklyn Pizza (chicken, broccoli, Gorgonzola) and the Carpaccio. The pizza wasn't the best I've had but I guess it wasn't the worst. I couldn't really taste the Gorgonzola and that's a pungent cheese. It tasted a little overdone on the bottom although it was flimsy. We each ordered the mango Bellini-those were yummy! In conclusion, I probably wouldn't get pizza again because I don't think it's worth the $14. Maybe I'll come back for a drink and happy hour one day though.]
