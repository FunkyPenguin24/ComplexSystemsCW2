[115421635416428263534,100097888270138002706,My review of the McDonalds Local in my area...people like having a glass of water and to rest before they decide to order. When I went there the manager said to me with an evil eye that they were going to make people buy something first before giving water... In my country U.S. It is customary to give customers' water so that they can rest before deciding to order and if they decide not to order and leave that's the way it is. Since wifi is at McDonald we like ordering water and resting before we decide to buy anything. Usually I buy something like ice cream etc. but after I have rested. And that I should buy something before I rest is outrageous.. Internet age is here with educated people.. The U.S. is not a fool's market where there is no rest....if you want fast food go back to the Sonic Driven Inn of the 70s (70's thats when fast food was great in the U.S.) Why do we rest and get water before to buy something ...it's to rest and to avoid the gimmicks if there are any on the menu and to check out the surrounding and go to the restroom.]
