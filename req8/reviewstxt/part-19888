[116198298203066992907,100053885706914461525,We are now finishing up our second year at Lerner school with both a preschooler as well as a first-grader attending. The school is fantastic, nurturing, everything we could ask for. My wife is Israeli and she absolutely loves the Hebrew and Judaic studies curriculum. Our children are thriving and maturing thanks to this wonderful school. We can't imagine what the negative reviewer has experience or whether she/he is truly legitimate, as I have not witnessed such issues as mentioned in that review. I would like to counteract those remarks. The school treats its non-Jewish employees and family members with respect. One piece of evidence is that the long-time head of school is non-Jewish. It is further noteworthy that I am a non-Jewish spouse with a Catholic background. I always felt fully accepted and was not treated in any way differently from other parents. The Lerner school has welcomed my children, my wife and myself with open arms.]
