[110001746405915451820,100191761549999385950,I used to love Dog's Day Inn, but have changed my mind since my dog was seriously injured there five weeks ago. My dog, a 12 pound 11 month old miniature poodle, sustained nearly a compound fracture of his leg while in their active room. He's had to have two surgeries to fix it and is still in a cast. First, DDI told me one dog landed on him while playing. They insisted that's how it happened and, when I questioned their story, the owner - Bill - became angry at me. A week later after I let them know the vet didn't believe their story either, they changed it and said two dogs landed on him. How can I possibly believe them? I used to love DDI, but I've found them to be pretty shady and incredibly rude. They don't pay for injuries to dogs, even though they say they do. And, based on my dog's injuries, I don't think the dogs in the active room are adequately watched and cared for. Why else would their story change a week later? I regret sending my dog there and strongly encourage you to think about the potential repercussions before leaving your dog in their care, as well.]
