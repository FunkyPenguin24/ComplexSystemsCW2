[101331594723492401052,100882308058548521948,Everyday Joe's is a rare find on the over saturated coffee house landscape in Fort Collins. The shop is very large with lots of room. Always quiet even when the room has a lot of people. A great place for a business meeting or studying. But the best part is the community that can be found at Joe's. It is often compared to Cheers, the fictional sitcom bar where everybody knows your name.]
