Beyond the colorful backstory of chef/owner Angelo Lutz, I'd still recommend this place for the great food: gravy full of flavor, not watery with pasta cooked to perfection, rather than cooked to death. I've tried at least 12 entrees here; and would say you can't go wrong. Palenta and sausage is my favorite appetizer; the seafood pasta made with a vodka sauce would be my favorite entree. The only Italian restaurant I can bring my grandmother and not hear "I can do better than this...."]
