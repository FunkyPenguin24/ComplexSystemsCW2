[102040595405131264381,100973611682298281517,We are a small business (established and trading for 20 years) that called the Able Group to re-glaze a broken window. Work was actually OK and they issued us with an invoice. All still fine. Like any regular business we logged the invoice and scheduled a payment on standard 30 day terms. 10 days later they chased - quite aggressively. Then they emailed, again, in quite stong terms. I replied to say that a payment was already scheduled and what seemed to be the problem. The claimed the job had been "cash on completion", which I pointed out was simply a lie and re-iterated that the payment was actually already set up and scheduled. A few days later I got a "notification of intent" (to commence proceedings)! What sort of business treats what was a happy customer like this. We had no intention of not paying, had informed them that our terms were 30 days and without even waiting to see if we were good to our word, they issue silly (and meaningless) threats. The real joke is that the "notification of intent" was that they would take us to court in 7 days - by which time the payment would already be have been made!! Avoid these people at all costs! What a pathetic bunch -and I can see from various reviews here and there that they don't exactly have a great record for their work! You'd have though that when the rare occasion happens that they actually have a satisfied customer, they would not do their very best to convert that customer into one who is most unhappy.]
