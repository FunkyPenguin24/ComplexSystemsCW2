[106282516829755187218,100141809762477999500,The wait time is longer that it should be for small services like tire changes and oil changes. They have really smooth talking and convincing salespeople/mechanics that will try to upsell you on everything. They will say they perform a extensive inspection on your car and come back with all sorts of things that need to be fixed but it's just a way to get more money. On one of there "inspections" they said one of my belts needed to be replaced immediately. I refused and a couple months later had no choice to go there again for an oil change. During that "inspection" they didn't see anything wrong with my belt but did notice that my rack and pinions needed to be replaced...See what I mean.]
