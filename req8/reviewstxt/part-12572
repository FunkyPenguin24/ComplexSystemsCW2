[113123289548698435136,100832301303972927173,I was disappointed with the presentation of my problems and explanations of what the repairs mean. Although it wasn't malicious, I think the customer service could have been more sensitive to a man who is OK with not knowing a single thing about cars. As expected, they found an additional $1500 worth of repairs. While I can't say they were wrong, the overall feel and vibe has left me seeking out a second opinion. ON a positive note, they recharged my AC and rotated tires for the amount I expected and in less time that was quoted.]
