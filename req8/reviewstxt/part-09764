[100894948897552864587,100680153072609953364,I LOVE THIS PLACE Food: A+ (Great quality food, interesting meals, they fill you up at a good price. Decent menu selection... the soup is REALLY great! Breakfast is neat with a make-your-own omelet option, but no waffles! My husband was so sad.) Service: C (Eh... average I guess. I feel like they have a lot of new people who aren't as knowledgeable as they possibly should be but if you get a seasoned waiter/waitress it is unbeatable! Once they get a little more trained im sure this place will run like a well oiled machine!!) Drink: B (selection is ...eh like any other bar in the area... Overall, not bad but pretty average and that is quite alright with me. This isn't really a bar spot its a food spot with the option of a bar area) Ambiance: B+ (quiet yet it has energy, casual yet it has some class, its a nice cozy place to be. The bar is tiny though. Also: the bar room and restaurant area are separated which is nice if your having quiet dinner)]
