[109378604810482769004,100155724489580757142,I've utilized Kapp's services for service and repair of my 'street use' Porsche 930 as well as my Porsche 951 race car. Specifically, Kapp's has done work for me as minimal as tracking down electrical demons, eliminating strange rattles, and installing a new clutch and as sophisticated as performing a full engine rebuild, roll cage fabrication, and suspension tuning among many other things. I've been utilizing their services since 2010. I'm very happy with the work they have performed for me, and with the great customer service and support that has accompanied this work. I recommend friends to Kapp's without hesitation.]
