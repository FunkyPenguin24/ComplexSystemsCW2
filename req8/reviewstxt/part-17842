[111441083606763648750,101121600784309783084,Cycle Lane is one of the best Bike Shops in the York area. The owner has a vast knowledge of bikes, kit and also caters in the needs of the user. After using Evans Cycles and being very disappointed in the work carried out on my bike I took it to Cycle Lane. I was amazed in the detail of work that had been carried out and almost to an obsessive compulsive level, even after a bad crash what could have been a very expensive repair bill was surprisingly cheap and also good quality! I would recommend this shop to anyone as i'm sure the next best thing would be having a pro team mechanic.]
