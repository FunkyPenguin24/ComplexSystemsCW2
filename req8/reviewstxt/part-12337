[100829673293672823332,100819837951907922187,The carpet cleaners were only in our large home about 45 minutes. It looked like they had only gone over the carpet one time even in the heavy traffic areas. After they left the carpets smelled good but within a few hours there was a musty smell and the carpet looked, felt and smelled no better than it had than before they came. :(]
