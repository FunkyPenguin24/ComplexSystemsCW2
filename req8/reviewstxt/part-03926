[117161573446269826255,100365182536958421443,Those attempting to plan a private event beware: I called three times and the sole person responsible for contact for planning events never returned my calls. There was no other manager or planner available to help. I could never get any information from Lindey's staff about event planning apart from having a message taken and never receiving a call back. Very unprofessional handling of this matter and quite surprising given the caliber of the restaurant.]
