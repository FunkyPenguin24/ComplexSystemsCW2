[106886408259020987879,100791001112467069115,I am new to martial arts but I know what I wanted. An art that is more function and less flash. That is exactly what I found when I started the Kali Combat program at FKA in Margate. This is a top notch program with a legacy to go with it. We train weapons and open hand close quarter combat. We focus more on offense and less on defense. Like we say... "It's always MY turn!" Challenging my body and my mind!!! Thanks guys you rock!]
