[100881300118783660436,100040968979925070581,Arriba is most certainly NOT authentic Mexican food, but I love it! We have tried many dishes over the years and I have practically liked all of them, especially anything with their queso fundido. I have also been to 4 other locations across the Valley and this is by far the best one. I am definitely biased when it comes to service because I have a few waitresses that I request (Oneyda and Dulce.) There is also a female manager and a girl that bartends that are really nice too, but I can't remember their names.]
