[105640144217621510272,100593751501934879008,The staff at this office is very kind and warm. They were hospitable to upfront questions about cost and very transparent. The communication in making appointments and confirming them showed great customer service. Dr. McKee is very reassuring. He seems to go out of his way to settle a patient's nerves, while remaining focused on the procedure. Most importantly, the work he did was great. My dental issues have improved because of his work, they healed quickly, and with minimal discomfort. I cannot say enough about this office and recommend them with the utmost confidence.]
