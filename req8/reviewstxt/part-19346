[115113271257102117826,100025443033990248201,I can't say enough good things about Rosen Honda. Everyone there is very friendly and helpful and does not give the car sales feel. I worked with David Krochmal and he made everything so easy. This is my first lease and he took the time to explain all the different options available. He has even helped with service over the course of the lease. I will definitely go back to Rosen Honda and David; and recommend anyone I come across looking for a car to go there.]
