[102751902894971915930,100865231210982164513,I was referred to All About Pets by my Vet (Lyndon Animal Clinic) and have taken my dogs (shepherd size) there for more than 11 years for grooming and boarding. In all these years, I have NEVER had a single issue, complaint or problem with the facility or its staff. Each of the employees know my pets by name and have a true concern for their welbeing. I have repeatedly toured the kennel facilities and can say they are clean and smell good - no urine or feces odor at all. I would recommend this kennel and the groomers without any reservation whatsoever! Their prices are very competitive! And finally, my dogs seem happy to go to the kennel/groomer. They are never reluctant or nervous, and this tells me a lot because my pets do not lie!]
