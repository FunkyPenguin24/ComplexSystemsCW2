[116752749153579923257,101015328270943440247,Fire Opal is my kind of place. In my opinion, it is just amazing from the moment you look into the front window. Each and every thing from a card to a dress is a lovely piece of Art. If you are lucky, as I have been more than once, you' ll find a treasure for yourself that you will have and love forever. A year ago it was a green hand knit vest, winter time it was a gray jersey knit skirt and I just fell in love with a ring and ordered it! The quality and appeal of everything at Fire Opal is excellent as is the service. Fire Opal is my kind of place, I wonder if it might be yours.]
