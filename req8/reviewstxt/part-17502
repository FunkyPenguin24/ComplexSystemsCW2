[109936714885465338123,101103057363976878897,Frank is a great guy, no bs about him! I've purchased and ordered several guns through him and have been extremely happy with how smooth everything has been. Unlike other gun stores I've dealt with he can make good on his promises to get the specific gun your looking for! He was able to get me an FN ps90 and FN fs2000 immediately!!! While other stores told me those guns were simply impossible to find in NJ!!!]
