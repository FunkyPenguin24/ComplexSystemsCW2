[116891398551461484560,100310878046132413112,We have purchased 8 different vehicles at Bud Kouts and have always been treated like family. Ted Holmberg in sales and Dave in the service department are two of the best customer service people in all of the Lansing area. I highly recommend Bud Kouts for a fair deal, service after the purchase and for giving you that "family member" feeling when dealing with them. They are the official car dealership of the Slocum family! -Britt Slocum]
