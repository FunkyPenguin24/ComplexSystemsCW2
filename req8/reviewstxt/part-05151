[114663092412127296119,100431541432646721297,Glentanner Park was the ideal place to stay during our visit to the Mount Cook area. It was less than a half our drive to the Mount Cook Village, and so many activities are offered right at the park. We took a magical helicopter ride around Mount Cook, including landing on the snow. We stayed for two nights in a powered site, the amenities were modern and clean including a state-of-the-art barbeque area . We were a bit disappointed to find that, despite what we had read on the website, dinner options were restricted, although, the meals we had were tasty and freshly cooked (sausage and chips for me and an omelette for my husband) and the service was impeccable. Apparently the cafe has recently been taken over by a new catering firm and they are still finding their feet, The decor is a bit tired, but there are plans for improvement. During our second night, when I expressed my disappointment at not having the tasty roast lamb that had been promised on the website, out of nowhere a beautiful lamb roast including vegetables and gravy was produced in under forty minutes! We didn't mind the wait, as the view from the cafe of Mount Cook and surrounds is absolutely breathtaking. If you are planning a visit to Mount Cook (and why wouldn't you!), please visit Glentanner Park, the staff are keen to make ongoing improvements and it will go from strength to strength I am sure.]
