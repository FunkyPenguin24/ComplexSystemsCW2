[111450988482252262762,100026961954393268061,The gentlemen is very nice but failed to explain to my son the policy if you PREPAY and make an appointment, if an emergency or something happens you LOSE your money. My son was promised 3 sessions, but we had to PAY for the third one. I think this is BAD business. At least they could have gave an HOUR out of the 2 hours we already paid for! Especially since the appointments were made 2 weeks in advance because NOTHING sooner was available. Feel like my son was cheated..]
