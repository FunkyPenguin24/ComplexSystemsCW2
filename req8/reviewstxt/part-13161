[117066606369549197640,100866100678481197071,Even after reading the poor review here for Best Western, I decided to go ahead and take a gamble. I'm glad I did. The hotel seems like it's brand new. The rooms were bigger than most I've stayed in. The bed was comfortable. Breakfast was wonderful (they even have a Texas-shaped waffle maker). The A/C in our room worked wonderfully (it actually made the room cold!). If it didn't say "Best Western" on the front, I would have thought it was a Hampton Inn or something. I would definitely stay here again.]
