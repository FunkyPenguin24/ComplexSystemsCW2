[100411070000157466651,100166477536030305015,Joining Cobra Kai was the best decision I've made in quite a wile. I don't really have too much experience with other gyms since this was the 1st one I joined but I have never thought about going anywhere else. Everybody who trains there is just as happy to see you getting better as they are for them self. Sim Go has a great was of teaching and is all ways great with answering any question I have had. Bottom line is that if you want to learn jiu-jitsu in Las Vegas then Cobra Kai is a great choice.]
