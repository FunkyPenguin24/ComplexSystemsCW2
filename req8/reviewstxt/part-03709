[106047031500565573951,100353652558784691372,I hadn't been to the dentist in over five years, and I was really nervous for this appointment. However, my fears were quickly eliminated. The office atmosphere was peaceful, and the receptionist was very warm. My dental hygienist was amazing. She was professional yet personable, and I trusted her immediately. Dr. Hogg was very nice as well, and very precise. He didn't overlook anything, and I was very pleased with his care. I can't imagine going anywhere else.]
