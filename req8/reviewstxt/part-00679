[111033602709905897875,100194903703326510382,Shortly after our SUV was totaled, we needed a vehicle quickly and decided to get a minivan. Wesley Chapel Toyota aggressively priced the model I wanted and we were able to drive home with it the day after I found it online. The low-pressure approach of salesman John Deloach and friendliness/helpfulness of the rest of the team put us at ease, and we appreciate the lack of stress that accompanied this experience!]
