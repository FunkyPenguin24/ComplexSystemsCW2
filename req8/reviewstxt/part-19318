[107058937411666824078,100023653262815887929,Harry Clark answered my call after TWO RINGS! I explained the situation a family member was having and he arranged to meet me within 30 minutes of my call. He met me at a very convenient location near my home and we were able to "take care of business" in just a few minutes. I was impressed both with his demeanor and his appearance. He was polite and businesslike throughout the meeting and he did EVERYTHING he promised to do. One thing he said that really hit home was "I care about people. I want to help people." And he does, trust me!]
