[109007408102047402821,100873145934480957148,I have been a regular at this location for over 10 years. About 2-3 years ago, I noticed a big drop in the quality of the food - maybe under new management or using new ingredients? But whatever it was, the food does not taste appealing. We decided to give it one last try yesterday and both the meat lasagna and the spagheti with meat sauce had a very peculiar taste. If that's all there was to it, then I would not be writing this review, but there is more. We both ordered soups wioth our meals and told the waiter to upgrade our cups to bowls. I was expecting to pay an extra buck, or at worse, the difference in the price between the cup & bowl, but instead I was charged over $7 for two additional cups of soup. Not only is this ludicrous, it borders on thievery. So in addition to lousy, overpriced food, they look to rip off the clients who have supported them over the years, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!]
