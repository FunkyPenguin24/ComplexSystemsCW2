[108495575973456890319,100272419039813768250,Don't even think about renting here, I repeat, MOVE ON don't rent here!!! I signed a lease here 2 months ago out of necessity and location, HUGE mistake. The manager was surely high on crack or meth the day I moved in, she's since been fired. Apparently they change managers here like you change socks. The maintenance crew here are about as useful as a sack of rocks. There is a huge hole in the parking lot where they've been trying to fix a water leak for over two months, that's right, one leaky pipe and they've been working on it for two months. Not only that, as of today, it's been 4 days since we've had hot water. Nobody in the complex has hot water and the current manager offers nothing but "we're working on it". This place is trash, run by trash, steer clear not worth a penny to live here.]
