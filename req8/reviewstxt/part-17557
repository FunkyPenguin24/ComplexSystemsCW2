[109728889670321988933,101106287648414372296,Tea Talk is a small drinks place that you can go to for cheap freshly made drinks. I gave it a 0 for food because the place doesn't sell food. The decor was simple and bright creating a positive atmosphere in the shot. Nonetheless, it wasn't something fancy that required a lot of work. The workers there tried their best to attend every customer's need because the place is usually packed with customers. It's good service. I tried asking for one of the workers' phone number and she did not give it to me because it was against her work's policy. So the place definitely hire capable people to work there. If you're in Chinatown and looking for a place to cool off, then this is the place. Although there was a sign at the window that said FREE WIFI, when I went inside, my friend tried to use the WIFI but it was locked. Weird.]
