[115803744033534017655,100560134004333762722,This is the best park in the bay area. So many nationalities (families) come to this park with their children. It is clean and maintained by the city weekly. It has one side for the older kids (play structures) and the other side of the park for smaller children. Both ends of the park have dog doodie dispensers with glove bags for those walking their dogs. It also has a BBQ area with picnic table. Huge grass area for frisbee or throwing a ball. I cannot say enough good things about this park. Good job to the city of mountain view for keeping up this park for our children/grandchildren and so on to play!]
