[101479750632017485900,100854557214305278961,I had lived in 501 N. Henry st. for 1 year starting fall 2010. I was not very happy for two issues: 1. noise: I was facing south western direction where drunken college kids yelled at random direction on their way back to home on Langdon., 2. top floor disadvantage of cooling & heating during summer & winter. So I moved out, spent 1 year on langdon, and now came back to 501 N. Henry st, but this time, to the unit facing north eastern direction on the non-top floor and now am very happy because I no longer have those aforementioned issues. So if you make a wise choice, I believe 501 N. Henry might be a decent choice for housing for students (I am a grad. student). What I particularly like about the building is 1. It has huge a community room on the ground floor where you can study and etc.. 2. It is located on the campus. 3. If you are facing north eastern direction, it is pretty quiet. 4. It is generally well-maintained and the staffs are kind in general. The lesson I learned from the apartment hunting experience is that, you must make a sacrifice something unless you want to pay for premium which I can not afford as a student. For instance, the studio unit I am living in 501 N. Henry st. is, pretty small (only 275 sq ft.). Final verdict: If you want to stick near to the campus but do not want to bother with noise from college crowd, north eastern side of 501 N. Henry might be a good deal, assuming you do not mind limited living space. Hope this review helps you.]
