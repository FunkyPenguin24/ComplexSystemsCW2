[111855676960276308944,100501003949084742120,Very reasonably priced. You write down on an order card what you would like to order. My brother and I both ordered a pork vermicelli bowl. They are huge and absolutely delicious. We got 2 giant bowls of food, an appetizer and 2 soups each for $27 and were stuffed when we were finished. An amazing find in guelph!]
