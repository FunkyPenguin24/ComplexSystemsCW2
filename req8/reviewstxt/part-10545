[101222644829696407131,100722905025732620063,They had an okay selection of hookah equipment, but not the best (they did have what I was looking for, but not a lot of variety). They did have a good selection of shisha though. They have a lot of pieces and water pipes too, if that is what you're looking for, as well as all the standards: a wide selection of cigars, tobacco, tobacco pipes, papers, cigarettes, and chew. The staff was friendly and helpful. There were several employees present, which meant they could help each customer find what they were looking for and ring them up with no wait. I did not feel pressured or pestered, which was nice as well because I usually know what I want when I walk in to the store. The shop was clean, well organized, and not cluttered (a problem many smaller shops suffer from). It would be nice if they were open a little later, but their hours are better than most smoke shops. Overall, a very good business that I would recommend.]
