[117502759954962377069,100010339334444420206,It's always a nice experiance at your office. I went through two years of invisalign with great success. Two of my three kids are done with their braces and have beautiful smiles. My third child is just starting. The staff is considerate and Dr. Becker makes us feel comfortable and well cared for.]
