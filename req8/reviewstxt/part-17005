[113912397938238436943,101075488257631617914,Growing Generations is a great company all around. They have been helping to create families for so long now; to people regardless of race, gender, sexual orientation, or marital status. Over 1,000 babies have been born through GG and I feel privelaged to say that I have birthed two of those babies. I am a two time Gestational Surrogate who has helped a deserving couple start and grow their family; and I am in the midst of doing a third surrogacy helping another deserving couple grow their family. The thought of helping someone experience the joy of parenthood, like I do, is the reason I wanted to do this and it has been so rewarding. With Growing Generations on your side, they help the process go as smooth as possible. They're always there to answer your questions; through phone or email; before, during, and after the pregnany. They offer lots of support through their website and personal staff, including a phsychologist for you to talk to as much, or as little, as you feel needed. I would definitely recommend Growing Generations, and have already, to anyone interested in becoming a surrogate, or egg donor, to help create or grow a family!]
