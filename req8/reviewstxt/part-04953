[101875924308314967266,100420881982537451398,Brandon the host is always welcoming and very good with recommending wine pairings. I especially find their Tempranillo wine selections to be outstanding in flavor and well matched to most dishes on the menu. The chef knows how to prepare lamb and rabbit exceedingly well with subtle flavors which enhance and compliment side dishes. The ambiance provides interesting Russian wall art and the usual clatter and high noise levels of many restaurants is thankfully absent. I love this place.]
