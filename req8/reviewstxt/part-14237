[101871485913812329156,100924745473644343325,I bought my last car, a used Honda Civic Hybrid, at Right Honda Aug/2011 due in part to their amazing Service Dept. Now I just purchased the new 2013 Honda Civic love these cars!! I even had the same salesman I had 17months ago who is now one of their sales mgrs which made me feel better, it says something about their company. I have had the occasional check in call which for me is okay to see where I am at. Being a single woman walking into any car dealership can be very intimidating, but I did not feel the pressure to do anything I wasn't ready for, I came prepared with facts & figures, asked questions, made phones when needed and although it can be a lengthy process in the end it was worth it. I am happy with my new car and would recommend Right Honda to anyone & don't forget their amazing Service Dept!!]
