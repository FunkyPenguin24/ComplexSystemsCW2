[100612654151397240356,100230116478142534323,After a night at Bastiens (look it up to see my review) and a great wine from Marcyk's to start the weekend, I didn't think it could get much better. Then I met a few friends for Saturday morning tea. House of Commons is the best spot for a nice quiet morning with friends. The owner can walk you through the history of tea while you sip on everything from an aromatic white tea to getting your caffeine fix with black tea. And don't forget - all the while you can be nipping at cucumber sandwiches, scones and little pastries. It was a great way to start the morning!]
