The Brazilian hair is off the hook, it feels so smooth and soft. I washed the hair about 5 times and it still feels the same as it did when I bought it. My best friend purchased her Brazilian full lace wig when I bought mine and I cant believe how good it looks. I wont go any where else only Natural Wigs. Not to mention the owner is so cool, she has alopecia, she's bald, and you would not know she's wearing a wig unless you look at her before and after pictures.]
