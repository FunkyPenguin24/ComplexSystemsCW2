[104653525041115448757,100555032363432229807,As a green industry professional, I frequently use CTF as a source for quality trees and shrubs, for both my clients and my own use. The owners and staff are knowledgeable, helpful, timely, and trustworthy. Their prices are competitive, the nursery stock is reliably healthy, and their customer service and attention to detail are noteworthy. As a small, family-owed business, my experience has been that they respond to every customer with individual attention. The retail display is beautiful and shopping there is a pleasure! In addition, Levi's commitment to supporting worthwhile non-profit organizations throughout our community is greatly appreciated!]
