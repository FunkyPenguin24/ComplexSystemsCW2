[102873139927385350938,100921046538654799633,I just had my first visit (for eyebrow waxing), and although it wasn't the fanciest place, the service was outstanding. I've been searching for a place that can do a good job shaping eyebrows in the Upper Valley for 3 years and this was by far the best, fastest, and cheapest ($10). I absolutely plan to go back and try out the rest of their services.]
