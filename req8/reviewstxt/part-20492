[109885864387955765856,100085260228297442366,We called ahead and asked specifically if they had a set up with queso and salsa and they said yes! We get there and we are a table of 4 and they bring one deal of salsa. We asked for more salsa and queso ans she brings one more salsa and one queso. We then asked for another deal of queso and we were informed it would cost an additional 1.99! As a table of 4 and us having 2 separate checks it would of been more considerate to give us 2 deals of queso before changing us for the second bowl. Besides that the food was very good.]
