[101302880455178065167,101154471645616672995,In one word: Awesome. The guys at K&M helped me out so much today, and I am eternally grateful. I was renting some equipment for shoot last-minute, and I'm sure I was super annoying on the phone asking 11 billion questions and changing my mind hundreds of times. Peter and Chris P at the rental counter were not only knowledgable and patient, they were also very accommodating and generous. They even talked to my mom on the phone about payment options, haha. (Embarrassing to admit I had to resort to that, but that's my own poor planning.) Michael also helped me decide on and buy a CF card very quickly and very knowledgeably. Everyone is friendly, they're competitively priced, and I will DEFINITELY be coming back.]
