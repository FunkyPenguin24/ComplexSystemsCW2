[102754747869845431887,100338120415501624006,This is my favourite library branch in the entirety of Knox County. Nay, East Tennessee. The catalogue of material is extremely thorough: most any movie you can think of, many popular albums, soundtracks, and classical music recordings, magazines, local newspapers, novels, biographies, et cetera. It's a astounding for a city of fewer than 200,000 people. Then, there's the environment. Tables for study are situated on the first floor, overlooking the traffic on West Church Street. Tall ceilings with circular skylights. Free public access WiFi, computers, scanners, printers, and copiers. A fun haven for children, complete with age-appropriate books. The architecture is very 70s, but I quite like it.]
