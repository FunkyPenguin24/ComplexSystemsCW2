[115652558479459755055,100420712163221966363,Kalin was amazing! He understands the athlete's body and is very knowledgeable in Thai-massage and neuromuscular massage therapy; tennis and sports performance; as well as Yoga and Chinese medicine. I've had several massages lately and Kalin's was the best. I highly recommend the Center for Massage Therapy in Denver.]
