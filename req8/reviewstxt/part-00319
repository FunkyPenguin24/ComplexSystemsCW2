[114179944315830317059,100175754013882608144,My check engine light came on after 9 pm on December 30. I had the car at Ganley by mid-day the next day (Christmas Eve). The car was fixed the same day, but I chose to leave it at Ganley for several days because I wasn't going to be in the area. When I came to pick it up before being at work at 9:00 a.m., the service people were so customer service oriented that I commented on their service to my colleagues at work (also a customer service oriented entity). My car was repaired, I was told what the problem was, and they washed my car and scraped off the snow before returning it to me.]
