[107662835301591044663,100540443408576841886,Food was excellent! My fiance and I went there and it was our first visit..we loved it. We got the mozzarella sticks as an appetizer and both got salads. I got the lasagna and my fiance got the Chicken parm...they were both huge portions and very delicious!!! Our service was great as well...overall a great experience and was very reasonably priced. We will be going there for Italian from now on.]
