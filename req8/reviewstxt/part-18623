[108175270406892230249,101162618371958140125,I went to Pep Boys a few days ago for an oil change, and as usual, I had a very pleasant experience. Juan Ortiz greeted me with a smile right away, and when I told him what I was there for, he said he would take care of everything and get me on the road again before I knew it. Juan explained the differences between the different types of oil that they have at Pep Boys, and he recommended the best one for my car and for my budget. I really appreciated the knowledge he gave me. The employees finished my oil change within an hour, and I noticed a definite improvement in my gas mileage after the service. I will continue to go to Pep Boys for all of my car needs, and I would recommend this place to everyone! P.S. Make sure you ask for Juan. He's very helpful.]
