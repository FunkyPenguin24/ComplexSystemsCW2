[100663844378137132312,100468760866189154730,I don't often get to eat at I-Hop but I had an early work day start today (5 AM Friday) and thought I would have a good breakfast first. I found that although the door signs say they are open 24 Hours a day Friday and Saturday that for I-Hop, Friday does not start until 6AM. So off to work w/o breakfast...lesson learned. Makes me wonder when the 24 hour day ends.]
