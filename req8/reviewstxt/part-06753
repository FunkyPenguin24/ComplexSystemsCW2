[106076322860554200948,100519552394317260014,Sheree has been cutting my hair for five years, and I was very happy to learn that she has opened a barbershop with her brother Jeff. Sheree is the only person that consistently cuts my hair right every time. She never rushes, even when she is fully booked and takes her time to get it right. Add in that shop is really clean and comfortable, there is really no reason to go anywhere else. I highly recommend it to anyone that is tired of the clich√©, faux-manly barbershops that sprinkle Chicago (and charge an arm and a leg for a cut).]
