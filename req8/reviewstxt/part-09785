[105204515697399600318,100681302953475452660,I was running late to arrive before they closed so I called to ask and they said 7:00PM. I did not have a reservation and was told there were plenty of sites left just come on. I arrived at 7:15PM and they were still open because of the few calls they received from others running late too. So needles to say I was very please they remain open for me to check in for a site they told me was one of their best. "Sure I thought" but they were right the site was great with a small stream behind it with a slight water fall made the night sound perfect for getting a good nights sleep. The shower house was very clean and sort of dated for the mens but the women's showers are brand new.. Which makes me think the mens is next for updating. The price is great with convent portable toilets close to the tent sites. I will vist again and recommend other too]
