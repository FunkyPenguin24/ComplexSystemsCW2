[100297124087916586174,100226865781032162300,The Brea Outback consistently has the worst service I've ever personally encountered. Twice now, we have had to walk out after not being so much as greeted for twenty-plus minutes. There won't be a third time. When you can get service, the food is generally awful -- wilted salad greens, overcooked meat, dropped on the table hard enough to splash the customers with grease. Avoid disappointment, avoid Outback.]
