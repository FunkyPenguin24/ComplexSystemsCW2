[111548344895783977638,100168400829812164536,STEER CLEAR. Please. If you want to have a great experience finding your dresses and bridesmaid dresses the house of brides is not the place to go. My best friend is getting married May 24th, 2013 however, we have not received our bridesmaid dresses. Keep in mind these dresses were ordered in August and early September of 2012! We were told at most 5 months after their quoted "10-16" week time frame and it has now been 9 months. This is absolutely appalling that they are adding more stress to this wedding and taking risks by ordering each girls dresses two sizes bigger than needed, which is going to give us a very limited time frame to complete any sort of alterations needed. The management is constantly putting it off and trying to ignore all of our concerns. If you want a stress free wedding avoid visiting the house of brides. It is not only a waste of time and money it is a scam. I am now in complete fear after reading these other horrifying reviews. I just wish we known of this before hand. It's a shame when the best day of your life is being held in jeopardy because of people who run this place do not take any sense of responsibility for their actions. The House of Brides is not only Poor-Fair it is ABSOLUTLEY TERRIBLE.]
