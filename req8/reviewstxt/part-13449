[112377628925330071940,100882423034324070648,This group went out of their way to give me a great experience. I had several things wrong with my bike, and they fixed them all at a much lower price than where I planned to take it. I'm back in town after 10 years in Madison, and the only bike shop I remembered was the one on University. After reading reviews on Google (Thanks, Google), I took it here, instead. Well, you can't judge a book by its cover. These people are a true "mom n pop" shop, working out of their home. The other is a new, very expensive store on a busy street. These people (Baker's) get great reviews, and I experienced great service first hand. I had a small problem after the repair, with no transportation there, and they came and got me, solved the problem free of charge and I was on my way. I can't imagine any of the other shops would have done that. They obviously stand behind their service. Remember, don't go for the poshest looking shop, go for the reviews.]
