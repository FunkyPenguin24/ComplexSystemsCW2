The brisket rivals any of the legendary central texas establishments and the sausage, pork chops, and smoked chicken are very good as well. The ribs can be a little hit or miss, but overall, this place rocks!!! I have seen some comments complaining about the sides and the sauce. WHO CARES??? I have never ordered a side there and probably never will. It's all about the meat and theirs is 2nd to none! Their prices are higher than most, but it's well worth the experience. I try to eat there at least once a week and catch some of their daily specials. The burnt ends and beef ribs are amazing!]
