[106553987939176051404,100863277519238177473,I have gone to this location a couple of times but last night will be the last. Their staff is very young so they seem disorganized at times but get the food out quick. The problem I have is I got food poisoning from there soup and have been up all night. I finally decided I was not going to sleep tonight and wrote this review. They have good food, average service, but beware of the soup!]
