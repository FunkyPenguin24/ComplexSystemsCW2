[100991475656501357053,100001961013706204662,I hit up Rudy's on a recommendation by the staff at the my hotel just down the road. Saying the food here is excellent is an understatement - it blew away my expectations about how BBQ should taste. The meat is tender and juicy - even the turkey! The cream corn is sinfully delicious. The decor is fun and up-beat, with a fantastic irreverent attitude that matches the energetic and engaged staff. Samples of the different options means you can make sure whatever you get is exactly what you want on the first try. My advice - this meat fills you up fast, 1/2 lb is all you need (however much your eyes are telling you to go for more).]
