[113956931811747462391,100455017656726108563,Some of the best Greek food I've had anywhere (including Greece). They use only fresh local ingredients, and it shows in the crisp taste of all the dishes. We had the houloumi (grilled slices of Cypriot cheese) appetizer, which was very flavorful and filling. I had the moussaka with horta (wilted greens with lemon-oil dressing), and the flavor and texture of both were excellent (lots of nutmeg). My wife had the pork souvlaki with spanakorizo (spinach rice), and both were amazing as well. The portions are large, the prices are reasonable (seriously, I would expect to pay that much or more for the same quality of food at home in TN, and this is NYC), and our server was friendly and attentive. If you like Greek/Mediterranean food and you're anywhere close to Brooklyn, this place will not disappoint you.]
