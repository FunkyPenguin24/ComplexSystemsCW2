[105491651362394693611,100202672332931030979,The facility itself is great. A lot of equipment to choose from and it is generally pretty clean. However, 90% of the staff are HORRID. They are incredibly rude and are totally ok telling you a lie in order to make a sale. There are a few guys really early in the morning and a few girls in the evening at the check in desk who are very pleasant. And the trainers, forget it they are ridiculous, you are promised an assessment with your membership, but the trainers don't seem to care much about you unless you are paying for the extra personal trainer. So the facility I would give a B grade. The staff and customer service are defiantly a large F.]
