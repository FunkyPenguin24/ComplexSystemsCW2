[110995693057851857563,100156950792822628910,I contacted Unger & Kowitt after receiving a citation I felt was unfair. Of course, the police officer was not interested in my opinion. Unger & Kowitt took the matter to court on my behalf, TWICE, all for the initial $69 fee, and got the case dismissed. It was worth every penny - no points, no payment of the ticket, no time spent at the courthouse. Throughout the process, the folks at U&K were helpful, courteous and encouraging. Highly recommended.]
