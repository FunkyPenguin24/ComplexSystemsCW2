[100567925379970098762,100503960067058274391,I used to have my home owners insurance with another insurance agency, until they made it feel like I had to jump through a dozen hoops to be able to do business with them. After filling out a form online with Lock to get a quote, Lucy was very proactive with me to make sure that all of my needs were met and that all of my questions were answered. I actually felt like a valued customer, which was very refreshing!]
