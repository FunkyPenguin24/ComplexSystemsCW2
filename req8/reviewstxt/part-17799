Their prices are slightly above what you pay in the city but the quality of their meat is so much more than what you buy in the city. If you bought the quality of their meat in the city it would be in a specialist gourmet store and really expensive. You have to try their chicken breasts wrapped in prosciutto and stuffed with sundried tomatoes and pesto. Their steaks are so tender and sausages brilliant. We called in before heading back to Adelaide to buy more meat to take home.]
