[106078520658741137537,100069040214175184007,When I first went to Meadows Chiropractic Center - I was impressed by the depth of knowledge the Meadows team had. However, what I was not impressed by was the treatment of their employees. Even when I slipped in to meet with a friend for Lunch and not the appointment I had there, it was obvious that the employees working for the Meadows' were treated neither with respect nor courtesy. The tension was thick and apparent. Regularly scheduling employees for weekend events, consecutive work weeks, not comping them for transportation or for the extra hours, bullying them when they resist, and so many other things violated an employee's basic rights as far as any labor board is concerned. The fact that they fired a friend of mine, a mutual employee who used social media as an emergency, as one of our mutual friends killed themselves, is unthinkable. If you want great chiropractic treatment - then by all means go there. This is not a mark against their abilities as practitioners of chiropractic medicine. They know their stuff. But if you want to support a business that treats their employees fairly? This is not the place to go.]
