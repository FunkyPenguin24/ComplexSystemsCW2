[102940879571767884639,100580405050053669807,My husband had a procedure done here in May 2013. Even though Dr. Horwitz seems to know what he is doing and my husband is now fine, all the other parts of the office are disappointing. Appointment requests were met with 'phone tag' and appointments were moved on the part of the center (not my husband). We asked for insurance verification and were told we were covered at 100% after waiting almost a week. I sat in the waiting room during the procedure. It was dirty and the other clientele were questionable. I was really turned off by their signs stating different must dos and the fact that the staff kept themselves behind this almost amour wall, separated from the people who are providing their income. The staff at the desk were not at all interested in patient relations. The nurses and other attendants were quite professional but did give different aftercare advice than the doctor gave. We placed a clarification call after the procedure and never received an answer. After the procedure, we received a bill for nearly $200. This doesn't sound like 100% to me. I complained and then was threatened with being sent to a collection agency. I currently need attention to one of my feet and under no circumstances would I return to Feet for Life Centers even though it is very convenient to our home.]
