[103244907468480389099,100837211848388705584,Very nice property located in the city center of St George with the big plus of having more than adequate free parking. Our room was nicely appointed with free high speed internet. The included breakfast was very good. The property has both an indoor and outdoor pool. Check-in was fast, efficient and courteous. From this location you can easily walk to many of the historical sites and there are many restaurants to choose from. The price makes this property a very good choice.]
