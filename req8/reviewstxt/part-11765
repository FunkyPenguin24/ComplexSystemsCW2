[106733090663207716085,100788748077484674802,My first time, the fries weren't great so I didn't get them the second time. From what I could tell though, they looked better on the plates of other patrons - a little more fried and crispy rather than the first go around. Let's get down to the burger, though. This burger was incredible. The meat was ridiculously hot but not at all burned - ideal for any burger. The sauces and toppings were really generous. The red onion strings were cut just right so that they can actually be bitten through instead of dragging everything out of the burger. The Bleu Cheese that I normally get on my burgers at other places is pretty wimpy but this place went to town! Lastly, the bun, which normally seems like an afterthought was incredibly flavorful. In summary, you know those hole-in-the-wall places with delicious cheap food that are all too few and far between? This is one of them. It's a gem of a burger shack that will outperform the overpriced Hugo's and the mediocre Grub's.]
