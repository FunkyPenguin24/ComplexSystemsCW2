[103857488838642216651,101132622301422846475,Friends and I ate at this place last night and have on a few occasions. They have great food but the waiter that we seem to get every time we go in is horrible. He gives us our food and NEVER returns to the table. Not even to give us our bill. That's just the start of the problem. I can deal with bad service by not tipping well. However, after last night I will never return. We got our bill after asking for it and the numbers didn't seem right so I added everything up. it was 3.00 off. we asked about it and he openly told us that he added it on because we didn't tip last time we were in there which was well over a month ago. He said he doesn't work for free and works for tips. We told him he had better customer service he would get better tips. I am one that will leave 10-20 dollar tips if I feel it is deserved. But when my drink is never refilled and u never see ur waiter again it isn't deserved. Like I said tho I will NEVER go back to this place because of this which sux because they have great food!]
