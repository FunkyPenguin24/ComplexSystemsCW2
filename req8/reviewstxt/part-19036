[113657073174619674641,100007909256884304640,Worst Brazilian restaurant in the LA area. Frozen meat (specially the picanha), expensive price, bad cuts, over the top decor. Been there twice, spent more than it's worth and was frustrated twice. Meat selection is weak and they lack a decent offering of premium cuts. Not coming back at all. Pampas at Farmer's market offers a better option and fair price. If you need the "churrascaria" experience, invest your money on Fogo de Ch√£o. It's more expensive, but you get great service, amazing meats and a knowledgeable cooking crew.]
