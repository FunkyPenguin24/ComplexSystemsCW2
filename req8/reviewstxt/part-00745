I was disappointed that I waited over 2 hours two different times to meet with the doctor and only saw her under 10 minutes. I was hoping to get more of a detailed plan and review of my health conditions for the amount of money that I paid. I think you can find another doctor that is more reasonable and personal in the Atlanta area.]
