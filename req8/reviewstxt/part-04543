[103250086847744099131,100401062601735710260,I have visited the Lumberyard on quite a few occasions with my grandsons. They are ages 10, 4, and 3. The little ones know how to ride peddle bikes but it is easier for them to ride their stryders there. I have never had a bad experience there until today! The staff is friendly and Liam is especially nice. However, today has changed my opinion of Lumberyard forever and I will never go back. I had my three grandsons and another boy, aged 11. The two bigger boys usually ride on the blue side. The two little boys went to the green area and it was unusually busy today. The employee, Will, who I assume is the owner was directing traffic over on the green side. He kept letting the bigger (7-10 yr olds) kids ride the track while the little ones had to keep waiting. The older kids would run the track, COME BACK, then Will would let them run the track again. All the while the little ones were STILL WAITING!!!! After this happened several times, I went onto the track and asked him to be aware that they were still waiting. I explained we could only stay an hour this trip and I didn't want them to be sitting more than riding. He was very cordial and promised to keep a better eye out.I appreciated this response, and he did try to be more aware. Then after about 15 minutes, he once again defaulted to his previous behavior. As I watched my grandsons wait and wait once again...I became extremely disappointed in his attitude. He would let them ride every second time the bigger kids went. I felt like my little grandchildren did not get full value, since they did indeed SIT and WAIT more than ride. I understand all about sharing the track on a busy day as well as safety concerns. It doesn't negate the fact that I paid the same amount of money for less value received than others. I will not be taking them back there.]
