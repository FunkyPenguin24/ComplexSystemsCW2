[102205065437430761287,100413318685814736032,Karl picked us up at the Ferry we took from San Fran, this was so convenient for us! Karl did a great job at giving the group tons of interesting information. Not just about the wineries, but about Napa, the history and culture. Having a local, who is loved by all of the people at each winery, made the experience that much better. We had an awesome group and we all ended up going out to dinner afterwards! The wineries that Karl chose for us were all unique, he really gave us a wide variety to taste. Lunch was like a delicious, healthy picnic. I have already recommended Karl and Platypus to friends and if I'm ever back in the area I will be sure to call them.]
