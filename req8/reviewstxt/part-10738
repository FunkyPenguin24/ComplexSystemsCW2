[106424230413176552822,100733196402513417848,We would like to comment on Koine Language School. My wife and I attended classes there for three years. We had a delightful time and received an excellent introduction to Italian. As a result, we have felt comfortable communicating in Italian wherever we have traveled in Italy. During our three years at Koine, we experienced only two criticisms of the program. One of our fellow students felt the administration was less than desired. We did not feel this was true but in any case the person responsible for administration has since left Koine. The other criticism was from an American who felt she was forced to think too much and stated she would have preferred a less rigorous program. Personally, we liked being part of a program that was both fun AND resulted in our being truly immersed in the language. While our opinion is just our own, it would seem to be supported by others as Koine has been awarded Excellence Awards for the last five years in a row from Language Course S.L., a firm that specializes in evaluating language courses across Europe. In all cases, their evaluations are based on “evaluations from former students.” We believe having two language schools in Lucca is healthy because it results in competition that will encourage both programs to improve. However, there is no question in our minds we would choose Koine for a first rate education in Italian. Frannie and Bill Rich]
