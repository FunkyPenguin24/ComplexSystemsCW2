[100061463729151914443,100224202806485636472,Terrible shop, website shows nice clean shop but the place looks like a hobo camp. Had transmission replaced in my car only to get it back with warning lights flashing on the dash and grease/oil all over the interior. The person at the counter refused to fix the problem and blamed me for the damage. Find another shop if you're wanting quality work, the warranty is worthless as businesses like this never last long before they're gone.]
