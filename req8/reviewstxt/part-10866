[108241399510424620274,100740349338606383685,I really loved going to Berean Baptist Church when I was stationed at Fort Bragg. Pastor Sean's sermons are challenging, thought-provoking, straight out of the Word, and very well put together. I miss this church, not just for the messages, but also for the warmth and friendliness of the congregation, the outreach they do, and the knowledge and passion of all the Biblical leaders there. I am glad I still get to listen to Pastor Sean's podcasts!]
