[100100330056901186734,100205095310857379991,Great location and very helpful and generous owners. The cabins were comfortable and clean and had a great view of a pasture and forest. We only stayed one night but it was a great place to get away from the touristy parts of Deadwood. I'd highly recommend the place.]
