[108639760998779484330,100916126148118673079,Probably best Barbour in town, friendly staff and environment. First time earlier today, Jeff was very helpful, it wasn't too busy, and it was pretty run of the mill at $16 not including tip. Only 4 stars cause they don't take debit/credit. Cash or check only, but there's an ATM right next door which I was able to run to real quick.]
