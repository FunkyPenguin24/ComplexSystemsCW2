[106838084408682814915,100391854734534066520,service and food was great, JULIA was awesome, everything good till she left, nobody out of hand, slurring, falling down or drunk but suddenly our group of 25 is now cut off, we have ordered 23 pitchers of beer and that apparently is to many. Our staff have just spent over $800 in booze, food, tax and tip and now told we are cut off, are you F*ing kidding me!!!! section full of adults having great time ruined by DUMB MANAGEMENT !!! guess what, never going there AGAIN or anbody from our workplace, all disappointed in how this turned out,]
