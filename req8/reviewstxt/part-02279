[111237208821691964593,100276531324932353585,My husband and I purchased a 2012 Jetta from Mike Raisor. Our salesman was Neil Dossett. He did everything possible to get us the car we wanted. He was a real pleasure to do business with and I can still call him and ask for his assistance when we need something. It is great to have a salesperson that cares for his customers. That will keep my family coming back to Mike Raisor as long as Neil is our salesperson. :)]
