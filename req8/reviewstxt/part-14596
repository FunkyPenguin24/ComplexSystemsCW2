[108264647882003211096,100945022036786742384,I was having issues with top wisdom tooth and my dentist referred me to an oral surgeon whom I met and didn’t like. I was really tensed and started looking online. Thanks to reviews I found ORA Oral Surgery and Implant Studio. I was initially there for the checkup and happened to meet Dr. Koos. The confidence he gave me in my first visit encouraged me to setup an appointment for surgery. He explained everything in detail about the whole procedure. I was nervous on the day of surgery but thanks to Dr. Koos, Nancy, Ali and Julie for painless experience. Best part is Dr.Koos himself called me the evening to find out how I’m doing and asked me to save his contact. I had questions about the food I eat on day five and left him a message and I got a call back in no time. I never saw someone who cares so much about their patients. I strongly recommend Dr. Koos. He is amazing and best in this field :-)]
