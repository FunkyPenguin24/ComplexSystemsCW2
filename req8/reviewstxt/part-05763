[102561342201471895372,100464821166973632130,I have been using chiropractors to help manage back pain for 27 years. Dr. Haugen is the most effective practitioner I've encountered in all that time. In the past, my goal was to manage the pain. With Dr. Haugen, we have set a goal of being pain-free, despite spinal and neck fusions, arthritis, and several other problems. This is because she set a goal, made a plan, and we're systematically executing the plan, step by step. I've been seeing her for six months now. She's introduced me to her massage therapists, something I was unwilling to try in the past. The combination of chiropractic treatments and massage has been a real game-changer for me. We started with traditional massage. The two Kirstens showed me that my body was wound up like a snare drum. I had one area where the pain just wouldn't stay away, though, so Dr. Haugen recommended that I try Cranial-Sacral massage, which I'd never heard of. Tonya is the in-house practitioner of Cranial-Sacral. It's a very different approach, kind of counter-intuitive, but it really works. She combines it with other techniques to address specific complaints, at least in my case. Tonya is very experienced, and is a master of her craft. She is working on something that I never imagined could be corrected - I clench my jaw very hard, waking and sleeping. We've only started on that recently, but I have several days between sessions when my face doesn't hurt at the end of the day. The only word I have for it is - awesome! Dr. Haugen will be my chiropractor for as long as she practices where I live.]
