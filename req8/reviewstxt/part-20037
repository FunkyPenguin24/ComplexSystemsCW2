[107607953307548573364,100062398313409227804,What a fantastic venue. We were picked up from our cabin and shown to a table upstairs by the window. Nice view. The starter was on our table in under 5 minutes and cooked beautifully. Salt n pepper calamari that melted in our mouths. My main was massive. Chicken breast with creamy mash and creamy mushroom sauce with steamed carrots and beans. Just perfect. All the staff were incredibly kind and helpful. Highly recommended.]
