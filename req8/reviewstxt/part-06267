[105112501997439455724,100490682178772776583,The staff is friendly, the center is clean, and the price is reasonable. The first time I called to schedule an appointment they told me what to expect and offered me a discount on my first visit. My technician, Brittany, was great. She made me feel comfortable, wore gloves, and did her best to distract me from the pain. I have gone back and will continue to go to European Wax Center because they are professional and the price is great!]
