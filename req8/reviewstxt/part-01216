[108267704989120911356,100222325758845334939,Went there a week ago , and from the outside it looks deceiving, with its out dated look. But the food was great I love their wings !!!. It was weird though they only had 2 ppl working their at the time , but they cooked our food quickly and were very friendly . Their wings are AMAZING !! I got cajun , and it was delicious !! . THe wings are like covered in the sauce which is , to me the best part about eating wings is getting messy . And I sure did the sauce was out of this world and the wings were great !!. It is a must EAT !!]
