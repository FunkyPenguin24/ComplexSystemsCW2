[110645236462341354242,100090298249666612868,I was very nervous while booking with this company but everything turned out great. They do ask you to fax your credit card information to them even after booking online and they also e-mail your voucher for the hotel stay for check-in which I found pretty odd but all was well. The prices were cheaper than everywhere else that I looked and they even allowed me to postpone my trip for a year because I obtained a new job right before the originally booked trip for only $50. Giovanna was very helpful with everything and, when I e-mailed the resort to confirm the reservation, everything was booked. No complaints here. It does seem like a shady operation but I had a good experience.]
