[104731961922170744870,100512671925968461609,I love these reviews by the staff!!! The new indoor pool is attractive and the general area around it is clean. Although the average age of the health club members must be high 40s to low 50s, the (actually quite unresponsive) club management insists on playing the "Top 20" which makes many of us absolutely cringe. Young people with their ipods can much more easily listen to the stuff they like than us older folks. Ladie's room, while not filthy, is not clean. Hair everywhere. Having a female attendant come through with a mop a couple times a day would make the experience much more pleasant. Members have to wash the floors before classes. Will look for a more responsive club when my membership expires. On the plus side, the two classes I take are fine.]
