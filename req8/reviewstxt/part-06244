[103521420211992418708,100489471477665390606,I've been looking for a good facialist for years! I've been to a few facialist at dermatoligists and spas but havent found one that wowed me and my skin. Finally after searching through Google I found Universal Laser Center located in Coral Gables. They have Hydrafacial therapy a nice microdermabrasion with hydratation right after the old skin is taken off. my fines lines are totally gone and I am having the last of 6 session next week, with greats results, I recommended to anyone. the value is 150 per session if you buy multiples session they do a generous discount, they also had the sun block from Clayton 50% off.]
