[113270782969090007385,100745146861340317744,Eric was terrific! I took my car to Service King after the hail storm in June. They were swamped but Eric made the experience painless. He kept me informed and answered every question I had. I was able to view pictures of my car online as it progressed through repairs thanks to the Nationwide Auto Watch. When I picked it up yesterday Eric was outside buffing some small areas to be sure it was perfect! I can't recommend them highly enough! Ask for Eric.]
