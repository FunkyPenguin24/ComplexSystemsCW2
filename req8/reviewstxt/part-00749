[111717188625909751153,100198257249780187042,DO NOT RENT HERE! I rented a 1 bedroom apt, and the rate that they were charging me (I later found out since I was new to the area) was almost criminal. There is nothing "luxury" about the complex or the apartments themselves. Everything in the apartment is standard and can be found at any complex for almost half the price. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. I asked to speak to a manager, and the representative refused to get them for me, and told me I would just have to "swallow" what she had told me. I cannot imagine speaking to a customer the way I was spoken to. For what they charge, there should be at least willing and helpful employees. Please do not waste your time and money here.]
