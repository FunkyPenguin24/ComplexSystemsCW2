[115695642565180136468,100402331255653951106,My husband Bought me a car. A week later the car had a service suspension system warning on it. No ones willing to pay! My Husband and I bought a used 2007 GMC Yukon Denali from this dealer ship Tim Dahle Nissan in Murray On(PURCHASED DATE) 12/17/13. On 12/26/13 a light for my service suspension system came on. The Service Department couldn't find a problem at this dealership on 12/30/13 and told us to talk to Tim Mills To Set up an appointment for us at a GMC dealership Which Tim did not do. I then called Tim Mills on 1/16/14 Because I am sick of waiting and want it fixed. So he tells me to Go to the " Salt Lake Valley Buick GMC dealership" Which I did. They told me the diagnostic would cost 102.00 and was I paying for it or the dealer? Tim Mills Said Yes he would pay for it. Done. Then the problem arrives when we find the problem.(Service Adviser )Says its the a Compressor Control ASM. Its a $702.00 bill and Tim Mills Says no the Tim Dahle Nissan Dealership won't pay for it. My warranty PORTFOLIO PROTECTION, is plan D the problems covered under plan F. My Warranty doesn't cover it end of story. So my problem is, Me and my husband are paying on a broken car and they didn't even tell me it was broken in the first place. Why would they? They need to make money off of people by resting codes and after so many miles the codes come back up and then its the Buyers problem right? So I get stuck with the bill. I drove this SUV 5 days out of that 13 day period. To the store, my kids to school, and then to the dealership where they couldn't find the problem. Or even pay for something that was already wrong with the Vehicle Prior to purchasing and now is again the Buyers problem. I would not recommend this dealer ship and I will tell everyone and every review board this til it is fixed. I dealt with Tim Miller at Tim Dahle Nissan in Murray.]
