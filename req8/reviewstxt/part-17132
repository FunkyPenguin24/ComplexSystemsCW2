[107877235347311757771,101083218943559317765,More like a 1 star......Chicken Tikka Masala was not good at all. The chicken was big pieces and just simmered into curry, tasted like it was boiled and put into the curry. And the pistachio kulfi was awful too!!! I didn't finish either of the two things! I don't know how old it was....I guess they cant make it fresher once its frozen! Big mistake of $26 expense.]
