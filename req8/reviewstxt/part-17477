[105178799946022009959,101101964779672633172,There is nothing more painful than having to load up your trash and take it to the dump or wait around for the city to haul it off on Big Trash Day (that is if they even will take it). Well no need to deal with that anymore, THANKS TO JUNK BOSS! I have multiple rental properties throughout the OKC Metro Area and have used these guys more than once. They are always on time, have a very easy to understand pay rate based on your load, well mannered, and have great work ethic! They also reached out and helped friends of mine that were affected by the Moore Tornado, volunteering their time and services for FREE and they did it without asking for recognition or advertisement. I would recommend them to anyone and will definitely be using them again!]
