[103419034858414013734,100243462877168235881,While driving our RV to Tucson from Phoenix, we stopped in at the Ostrich Ranch. My wife the photographer wanted to get some shots of the Ostrich especially but we had no idea there were deer, goats or mules there too. We noticed that the Ostrich were literally fighting over the food. For awhile, it was fun to feed them and I put more attention on letting them all get as equal a share as I could. Then we noticed the sores on their necks. Poor guys. We moved over to the deer feeding area. That was kinda fun too, until we noticed their hooves all curled up and WAY too long for them. This was not normal and we began to feel a little sick. Fun turned to wanting to spend the rest of our day making sure they could all get enough to eat. A well fed animal isn't going to overpower another one in order to get a few nibbles, but these guys were. Goats sticking their heads through little holes in the wall wasn't enough. They put their legs through too and in some cases there were two heads poking their way through. Whatever they could do to get some food. Compared to another place I'd been to in Canada a few months earlier, these animals simply were not happy. The only reason I'd recommend going there is to make sure the animals get some food. It's only purpose that I can see for the passer by is to feed them, so buy twice as much and spread the food around as best you can. There is another review here titled "Distasteful" and my wife and I agree with their assessment]
