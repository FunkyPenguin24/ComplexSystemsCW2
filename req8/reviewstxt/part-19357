[110123508272958331223,100025804498058636825,Found a reasonable price for oil change and tire rotation ($44) using Honda's website, and booked a service appointment. When I arrived, the gentlemen explained that these services would be $56. I explained that I had booked a lower rate online, and he countered by noting "he had been there for five years and these had always been the prices." He also explained that the Honda website didn't connect with their service website, requiring me to re-enter all of my data. Thankfully, I brought a work laptop with me, and was able to show him the exact price quote and reservation (the reservation apparently had gone through by means unknown when the rest of my data did not). Only after showing him this quote did they change the price, which seemed pretty fishy. The quality of the repairs, turnaround time, and facilities were fine, but this left a sour taste in my mouth. Integrity matters to me as much or more than anything else when it comes to dealerships. Caveat emptor.]
