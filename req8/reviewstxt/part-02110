[107400807752326444750,100268300602412876547,Double Diamond has been a great gym. Super facilities. I make use of the cardio machines and SPIN Classes and never have to wait for a treadmill or spin bike. The star of the club has to be Sanddon. I started my membership supplementing my cardio workouts with personal training with Sanddon. More than just punishment, Sanddon looked at my whole program, what I was eating (and how often), how much was I working out and what I was doing. Then of course was the punishment. Sanddon is great at getting the best out of you, pushing you when you need to be pushed but mindful not to over do it. I would recommend Double Diamond and Sanddon any day.]
