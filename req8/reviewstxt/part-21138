[106606857969836248185,100120082135959380886,Exceeded My Expectations! The end of last year, I needed help remodeling the new location for my business prior to our move in date. I contacted Mr. Handyman, and Mike met me at my convenience to assess the project and provide me a quote. Two days later, I called to schedule the job, and within the week, the project was complete. His technician was professional, polite and knowledgeable. In fact, he left the project site cleaner than he found it. I would definitely use Mr. Handyman again and would have no problem recommending them to any of my family, friends or professional contacts.]
