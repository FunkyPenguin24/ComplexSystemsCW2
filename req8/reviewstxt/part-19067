[115330582117336055589,100009109592010567995,I received a Groupon gift certificate to Complexions for a massage, facial, and manicure. It took a while to get an appointment but finally set one up. The massage was nice; the massage therapist did try to upsell me but I expected it because I had already read the Google reviews. Next I had the facial. This was my first professional facial and was definitely my favorite part of the day. I was so relaxed, I didn't want to move when he was finished. Finally, I had the manicure. I wanted to upgrade to Shellac but when I pointed to it and asked Bianca, she said they don't do Shellac (why would you have them displayed then?) And, I agree with a previous reviewer that my manicure started chipping after 2 days, if not before (and all of my nails ended up breaking). I still have another gift certificate to use for the same 3 treatments, but I know what to expect, and all and all was really happy with my services and the people that performed them.]
