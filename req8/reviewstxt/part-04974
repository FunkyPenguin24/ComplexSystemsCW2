[118423540126060762878,100421843460585824595,Patrick has been super helpful throughout this whole process. Right after our building fire (we manage a small apartment complex) other disaster restoration companies were breathing down our necks for the job. Patrick with service master was extremely courteous however, did NOT force his crew on us, just simply popped over and handed us a card - let us know they would love to help us with the clean up and restoration. Needless to say, we picked ServiceMaster and they have been doing a fabulous job handling the cleanup and rebuild. Not only that, after all the other companies talked about how our insurance company was their main partner blah blah blah... turned out, our insurance agent had NO idea who the other companies were, but knew Patrick by NAME! Thanks Service Master!]
