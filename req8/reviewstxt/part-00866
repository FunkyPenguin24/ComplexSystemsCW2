[100846648515704751126,100203926947468272328,Took a 2nd trip with Captain Mike this fall, and once again, he did not disappoint. Four of us left for a day's worth of fishing. On the way out, I noticed we were headed towards a grouping of boats that I assumed were fishing a reef or other structure since the sun was just coming up and it was probably a perfect time for the fish to be biting. Turns out, this structure was a place to net bait fish. There were 7-8 boats there during the 10 minutes or so we were approaching them. As we got closer, I saw all these boats struggling to get their nets in the water, and always coming up empty cast after cast. Captain Mike pulled into a tight opening between two other boats, tossed the net, and pulled up more bait than we could have used the entire day. It was amazing. Watched those boats fade into the distance as we were off to put our lines in the water, and not one other boat pulled away. Captain Mike clearly knows what he's doing. We had our lines in the water in no time, and landed 10 different species of fish. We had plenty for dinner and fought goliath grouper, one over 350 lbs. Another awesome day! We'll be back.]
