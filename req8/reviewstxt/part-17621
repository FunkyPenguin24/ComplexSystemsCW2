[114429322545350180157,101110021169756836691,Very interesting, and well kept. Some parts of the ship are stuffy but most are well ventilated and cool. One thing to note though is that is ship is not very wheelchair accessible as the only way to go up is by VERY steep stairs. Overall very good museum and exhibit.]
