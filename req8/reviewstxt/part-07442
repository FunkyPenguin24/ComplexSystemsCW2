[101225942099776559801,100557146217158775702,Best choice of seafood I've seen locally (Lobster tails with Honey and Mustard sauce was stunning). Also plenty of other choices including grills and vegeterian. Generous portions, nicely presented (proper chips) and helpful, friendly service. Will definately be going back.]
