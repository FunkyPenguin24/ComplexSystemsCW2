[105140611834792349250,100423281015218522777,We have a 12 week old German Shepherd that we have taken to WPVH for his shots and to check a rash he'd developed on his stomach. The entire staff, from tech to Doctor, were extremely outgoing and knowledgeable. We feel very comfortable bringing Archer here and highly recommend this Vet. I only wish we'd come here sooner with our other animals. :)]
