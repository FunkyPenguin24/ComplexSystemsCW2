[118251722761838093625,101143407596385450446,We have now used Overhead Door Company of Atlanta 2 times - both times for a "check up" on our garage door. Our service tech, Jay, was knowledgeable and went above and beyond what we could have expected. He even was very kind to our 7 year old daughter who was enthralled with what he was doing. He answered her questions and helped HER to understand better! We will only do business with ODC of Atlanta!]
