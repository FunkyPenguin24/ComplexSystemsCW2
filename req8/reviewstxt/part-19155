[112715673647158465152,100014008550360504210,I have taken 2 different units to Nanotech and received prompt courteous service and the price is always as quoted. This last time it was a 3rd Gen ipod touch that no one else would touch. Even Apple. Repaired as quoted in good time, less than it would have been to send to apple and 100 bucks less out of my pocket. Awesome. Keep up the good work. I highly recommend! As Arnie would say, I"ll be back!]
