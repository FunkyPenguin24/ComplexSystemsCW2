[100140767924945901506,100907956321231333114,Italian restaurants have always been hit and miss with me, even the major branded/chain ones I find it hard to like the dishes - too rich, too much sauce. Lazeza is a great italian restaurant with a difference - the food has a more defined, smooth flavour with huge portions of pasta, pizza, meat and fish dishes. I've tried several of each and all are cooked to near perfection, every time. We've been to Lazeza at least twenty times and I can firmly say it's quite simply the best Italian restaurant I've ever eaten at! Prices are very good and there's the occasional "any pasta for Â£6.95" offer on. Deserts and starters are equally as scrumptious! Staff are always welcoming and you can usually grab a seat without reservation. Definitely one of the better haunts in harrow. Go see and eat!]
