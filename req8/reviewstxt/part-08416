[100433296057053487722,100609484254947025016,Rented an apartment a few blocks from this place, and decided to try it out for lunch. The sushi was fresh and delicious, and felt a little more authentic / traditional than normal strip mall sushi tracks. However this track in particular is pretty neat as the plates come by way of an actual Train on tracks! The plates were on the cheap ranging from the usual $1 to $3, I got out of there for under 10 bucks. Try the tempura snapper and calamari. I will return!]
