[101537379729399129593,100965223941909947266,I walked into this store AFTER walking out of another store because of their poor attitudes. Truly, I was immediately relieved when I first met Rick. (owner) He was helpful, kind and caring. It didn't matter the size of the service you needed- HE WAS THERE TO HELP any way he could. He solved my immediate issues and helped me by servicing my computer to avoid additional problems that would have delayed my project. He also saved me $80 on my Mac battery. When I went back to pick up my computer I met his wife and she too was excellent and helpful in every way she could- (she might even be his "better half")- YOU CAN TRUST YOUR PERSONAL EQUIPMENT WITH IDOCTOR- and know when you return its ready to go.]
