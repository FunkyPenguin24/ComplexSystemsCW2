I, too, wanted to patronize a local business. The price was nearly double than the Geek Squad, and I pointed this out. I was told that they charge higher rates because they add useful software. Considering this was a laptop that I was going to sell, I trusted that they would do a complete re-set and add the software as promised. When I turned it on, I believe the reset occurred, but no added software. Disappointed that I was charged more and received basically the same service as Geek Squad. I won't be returning.]
