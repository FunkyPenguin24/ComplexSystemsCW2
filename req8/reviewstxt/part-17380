[101677418912044752229,101096246729902421421,I had a great stay in July of 2013. The staff was friendly, the site was clean and all the utilities and hook ups were in good shape. I didn't get to use the pool, but it was clean and had people using it throughout the day. Overall, I enjoyed my stay and plan to use them again when I need a park to stay at. My stay in July was only a few days and I got a great site for my stay.]
