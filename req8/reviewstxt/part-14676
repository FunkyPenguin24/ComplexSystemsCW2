[103268922595229828925,100948699058899097332,I found the billing system and reading the bill very confusing and. 1. just to start reading the bill on E-bill is not easy to find. They made it so complicated that you have to know the size of the paper in order to be able to find your bill. 2. "Account status Year to Date" section is completely confusing. It is not clear how much deposite I have with Veridian. How much is my balance for charges and so. There are some "-" that I do not understand what is all about. 3. The graph on the time of use reflects the American calendar rather than the Canadian Calender. For Example on July 1st, it is a Canadian holiday. You would see the On Peak usage rather than Off-peak that it should be. please correct them. Regards, Najib]
