[111955346455132693333,100481667859308869155,Saw this on Sydney Weekender and thought it would be a nice place for my Wife and I to enjoy a Sunday lunch. When we arrived for our midday booking, we were eventually shown to our table where we sat for 25 minutes before getting a drink. After another 20 minutes I asked the service staff, who were very pleasant, to take our order. She did so, but informed us the kitchen was not taking orders at the moment, so there would be a delay. Incredible considering I had booked a table for midday and it was not about 1;10pm. So we sat and go our entree in about another 30 minutes. This was average at best. nearly an hour later we recieved one main course, with the service staff apologizing that the other main would follow soon... 10 minutes later. During the course of the afternoon, we listened to the staff aplogise to everyone in the room about the delays. It seemed to me the kitchen was not organised, and the delays spoilt what promised to be a nice afternoon. We left at 330pm (3 1/12 hours for lunch) Might one day give them another chance, but they need to work harder in the kitchen if they want to charge the prices they ask. PS: other tables around us also commented to us their disappointment in the time frame... no fault of the service staff, by the way.]
