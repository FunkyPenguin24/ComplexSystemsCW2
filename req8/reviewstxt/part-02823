[100607177680299640766,100304542410862679682,I recently had an encounter with Kiwi Carpet Cleaning Services, LLC. It was not a good encounter. Before the technician arrived, he informed me that the gratuity was not included in the coupon I purchased from Google Offers. I was okay with that, since I wasn't thinking of paying a gratuity for carpet cleaning services anyway. When he arrived at the house, outside of the original schedule service window, I might add, I ask was that normal procedure to ask for a gratuity. He stated to me yes, since I wasn't really paying for the service, since I was using a coupon. So, I ask what about the $65 I paid. He said, that wasn't really for the service. I felt as though my intelligence was being royally insulted. So, I told him to just come on in the get started. I think he didn't care much for my suggestion that he should come in and get to work and enough of the small meaningless conversation. He quickly decided he wasn't going to do the job and abruptly left. I was stunned, how can a business operate as such. I immediately decided to write a review on this. Everyone, be careful when you get this service. I don't want anyone else to have the experience I had. I left a message with the number on the Google Offers couple. I didn't get an answer and no call back. If I don't get the service I paid for, I will file a lawsuit against the company.]
