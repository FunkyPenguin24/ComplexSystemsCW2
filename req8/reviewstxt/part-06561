[102602362949813071672,100508331064971304376,Tracey is the RUDEST person I have EVER met! My bff & I went there to put in our apps, We live almost an hour away from Falcon Staffing, We wanted to carpool to & from Alliance Airport to save on gas. Now if One of us couldn't go in for that day no problem we both have our own cars so the other could have still gone. Tracey goes on (all but yelling to our faces) "Do NOT call me & say/ask one word of the other! I am ONLY dealing with you if I call you to work!" We agreed that that made since and was totally fine with us. Few days goes by & she calls to tell me that The temp Cell phone refurbish we was doing was ending and had to let US go! Now where does she get off asking me if I talked to my bff and then precede to tell me how she was let go also!? How in the world is that fair/right?! The woman is crazy & I think shes drunk on her power of "I can hire or fire you!" She's a bitch! excuse my language......]
