[111093927693351660320,100276099048839248394,Absolutely beautiful location. The visitor center is well cared for and the garden is serene (aside from the occasional passing train, but just work that into the experience and it's perfect the way it is.). Inside is a great collection of photographs and a replica of a typical worker's shack. I found the experience well worth the stop.]
