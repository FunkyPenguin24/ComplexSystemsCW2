[106847866148629246914,100727754140773158237,I had an accident with my Macbook Pro and a liter of water. I took my macbook to a Apple store, and was told that the motherboard hab to be fixed and it would cost me $1280.00 to fix. I decided not to fix it. Fast forward to 6 mos later and my girlfriend and found PCMac Tech. She told Blake my story, he said he could probably fix it for $600. I brought it to Blake he fixed it and had it running within 2 wks. (It would have been soon, but he had to wait for some parts). My Macbook works like new! I have nothing but praises for Blake and his crew!]
