[115275556410317152507,100029659768479726014,I've been living at The Overlook at Lakemont for about 8 months now, and its been a great experience. I moved here because of a new job and had to find a new place to live within a week. I got really lucky in finding The Overlook at Lakemont because they had exactly what I needed at a price that was very reasonable (considering it's Bellevue). The main office knew I was in a time crunch and worked extra hard to move me and my roommate in before I started my new job. Stephanie at the main office was incredibly helpful and continues to be very helpful 8 months later whenever my roommate and I need anything. The Overlook at Lakemont has a lot of perks too. One being the location; it's in a heavily wooded and secluded area that is awesome in the summer. It also has 2 outdoor pools (1 is remodeled), a hot tub, a small gym, and many trails around that you can run on. I'd also consider the main office a plus since they are very friendly, which I haven't experienced with previous apartments. As for the apartments themselves, they are great. Most of them are remodeled, with granite counter-tops and other small changes. Having a washer and dryer in each apartment is super nice as well. I've been reading other reviews saying that the walls are too thin and that you can hear everything from the neighbors around you. My guess is that these people haven't lived in an apartment before because this is normal. Just hope you get good neighbors is all you can do. Overall, I highly recommend The Overlook at Lakemont.]
