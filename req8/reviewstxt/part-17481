[101939407453932067735,101102139892012195356,The delivery service is very bad. The driver refused to deliver to the premises, he called demanding someone to wait for him in the street and was very rude. When called to complain at the branch the person on the phone was even ruder & did not care. Service is below zero. Avoid this branch.]
