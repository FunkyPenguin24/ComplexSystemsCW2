[101580830069499185780,100602816130507537470,My family has been attending Clovis Hills for almost 2 1/2 years and we absolutely love this church. They have a very inviting and non-threatening atmosphere, which we really liked since we had not been to church in 20+ years. The spiritual growth that we have seen in our family over the last 2 1/2 years has been tremendous. Both pastors do an excellent job making the sermons light and relevant to todays issues/struggles. The worship band is absolutely amazing and energizes the entire congregation each week. The children's and youth ministries do a phenomenal job teach kids and teenagers biblical lessons as well as leading them through activities that make it enjoyable. This is a great church!]
