[100059942865109201090,100254533442259450511,I just barely bought my first Harley from GoldenSpike. Fantastic group of people. I wasn't just a sale I was treated like "Family". Introduced me around to the parts team, sales team and service. Not one time was I treated like this when I owned my previous bike. Cannot say enough good about the entire team there. Paige was amazing to work with on the purchase... Low key and no Pressure and I appreciated that. I have and will recommend GoldenSpike to my friends.]
