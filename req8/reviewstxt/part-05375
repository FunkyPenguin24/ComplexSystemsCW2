[102110095939492073624,100445069753762192406,Snookies is a wonderful malt and ice cream parlor in Beaverdale Iowa. It is family owned and has become a very popular place to go after games and various school events. Everyone becomes very sad when it shuts down for the winter after the Beaverdale Fall Fest, and thrilled when it opens again in April.]
