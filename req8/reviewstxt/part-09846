[114709750043103656522,100684210695647407123,everyone was super friendly and dr. lee kept asking me if i was "okay" during the procedure. which i thought was very nice, because that was probably the first time a dentist checked in on me during the procedure to see if i was okay. i recommend this for everyone and would consider coming back.]
