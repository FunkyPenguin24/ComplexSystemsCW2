[116874899482235898928,100922552398710938734,Excellent customer service. Had a death in the family and was forced to cancel the trip at the last minute. CONNIE in reservations was able to refund us. Thank you so much. One less burden to deal with in such a hard time. Once the smoke clears, I will definitely be back with my wife. Thank you so much Connie for your understanding and Professionalism.]
