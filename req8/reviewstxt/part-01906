[118339939393349538421,100257715646444884233,Went to Fitz's quite a bit, and generally enjoyed my experiences. There's been a few times that service was slow, or the food order's were incorrect. Things like that. Nothing too terribly drastic that you would take heed to resist the place though. I love their floats and the wraps. They have the best bottled soda around in my opinion. Definitely a place you should check out.]
