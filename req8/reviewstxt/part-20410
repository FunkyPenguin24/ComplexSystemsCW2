[109801464113807982581,100081470448904346155,Some of the seasoned staff (both management and people working there for as long as I have been going there) at Vit City can be downright rude, don't even bother to look you in the eye when you are speaking to them and, alas, in need of serious grooming. I find that the newer staff have a concept about customer service and are able to actually address me as if I am a real, live talking person (not to mention, a customer). If it weren't for the fact that their organic produce is cheaper than whole foods and they have some items I can't get at Trader Joe's, I would not bother with this store. As it is, I get a lot of my health staples online and only use this store as a testing ground for something I want to try before ordering online. Amazon has a lot of the vitamins and staples that they sell and since it quite a drive to Vit City, I figure the tradeoff betw shipping fees and gas are pretty much the same now days. I do wish the management made an effort to have better customer service...then I might find it enjoyable enough to take the drive over to that part of town and actually look forward to shopping at Vit City.]
