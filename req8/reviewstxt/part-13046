[112621710704521529239,100859846289181452267,July 8th 2013, The overall stay was Fair to Good. The Bath Tub was patched, but not finished. I was a little disappointed to find out from the desk clerk that no rooms had Jetted Hot Tubs as presented in the last 2 pictured (#15 &16) on Roadway Inn's website. I think this a straight out Misrepresentation regarding the Jetted tub!!! The price is good, but you get what you pay for, so I guess it all balances out.]
