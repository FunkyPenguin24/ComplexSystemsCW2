[117896335980407009797,100705128246486327787,Pickup USA is a great place to work on your game and get some runs in. It's at a convenient location of the 605/210 freeways, everyone on the staff is friendly, and you don't really have all the meatheads that run around at 24hr or LA Fitness. Everyone here is here to play basketball. They have a well organized system for getting in games too...when you check-in, you're entered into the queue for the next available game. If you win, you stay. If you lose, then you can get right back into the queue. No more arguing over who's got next!]
