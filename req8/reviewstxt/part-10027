[117308373754619019415,100694765740453674089,GREAT!! I would recommend BeanTree Pediatric Dentistry to anyone with a child. Dr. Mason works very well with the children. The place is very clean and nice, and they have a great room for children to play,color,and or watch movies while waiting to be seen. My son loves it.]
