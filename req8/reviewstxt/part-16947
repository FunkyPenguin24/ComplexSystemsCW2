[102980792875344782282,101072315180328875075,Getting an old ring of my grandfathers appraised was a great experience. Not only did Ron tell me what the ring was worth, but he told me about the little details of past repair work he could tell had been done to the ring, and the time period he thought it was from based on some of the detailing on it. Great experience! They really know their stuff!]
