[114212265977831309717,100135998189901106969,Had an excellent stay at property #5644, Kenison's Baywatch. It's a great property, convenient to everything we were interested in seeing and doing, and just the right size for the family (even my Mom's overly-jumpy Yorkie liked it!). The sunsets were beautiful, and the hot tub was a welcome amenity. Keyless entry and the membership in the Village Club for the week were very welcome (I went to swim laps in the pool almost every day), and the sound access was very nice as well. Only complaint... we must have found a dozen little caterpillars inside the house during our stay, but that's something to be expected this time of year (And I'll confess to leaving the doors open sometimes), but a quick vacuum took care of that problem (and this house has a small hand-held in the laundry!). Places to recommend... Josephine's for Italian (in Kitty Hawk - it's small, but the food is excellent) and Pamlico Jack's (great food and wonderful views of the sound). I'd also recommend a dolphin tour (we used Kitty Hawk Kites), and of course, visit the lighthouses in the area. We'll be using Resort Realty next year!]
