[101864961937899553956,100685793558336042201,I send my students to this store because th staff is knowledgeable and accessible. I think a lot of kids expect an a-hole "comic book guy" manning the counter. Not so at this place. They have just about every popular title and then some. All of the DC Direct collectibles, too.]
