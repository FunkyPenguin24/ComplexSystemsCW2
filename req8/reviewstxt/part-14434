[102590217547129646401,100936623874326481823,I seldom write reviews for places but for this, I had to share. I'm a simple man who likes Chik-fil-a food, so I went there for lunch one day. The place was clean and the food was very good, but those were givens. The one thing that caught me off guard was the service and the employees. These people were smiling and friendly â€“ honestly, some of the nicest people I've ever met. The guys made jokes and were on par with my complicated orders (I have needs, okay?). But anyways, as I was eating, a wasp came out of no where and the cashier rushed over and killed it before I even realized it was about to sting me and possibly ruin my appetite. He apologized over and over and when I walked out the door, he gave me a drink, free of charge. I walked out satisfied and appreciated. This has honestly been the greatest Chik-fil-a experience of my life.]
