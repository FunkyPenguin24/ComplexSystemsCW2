[116034222534330927938,100448395276427947675,We hired Sweeney Photography for our wedding pictures & were both VERY IMPRESSED with how Mary Sweeney went way above & beyond any & all of our expectations!!! She was very professional, she met with me 3 months prior to our event to go over all of the details of our contract & to make a shot list detailing all of the various shots we had hoped to get. She also checked in with me at least once a month leading up to the event.The day of Mary showed up to the venue early to take detail shots of the decor, while there she noticed I was running behind & so she took initiative & offered to help me set up a few last minute things (thanks again Mary!). She then came back to the hotel with me & took shots of us getting ready & then throughout the hotel before the event. Her ideas for placements & poses were so unique & fun!! We arrived at the venue & right away we started taking family shots, Mary was so great at mixing & matching the different groups of people, making sure not to leave anyone out! Anytime our guests had asked to take pics with us Mary would kindly step aside to let them take their own pics, however she would be taking the picture as well - which was awesome because now we have all those unexpected pics too!! Mary stayed through the duration of our reception & did not leave until we assured her that we had all the pics of poses & people we could possibly think of. We really enjoyed Mary's personality as well as her professionalism. The picture proofs were ready for us to view 2 weeks early, which was awesome, the only problem now is that they are all so amazing we are having a hard time choosing which to print!!! We'll be sure to keep you posted on how the final prints turn out!!! :)]
