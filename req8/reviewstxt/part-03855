[101657002831096567225,100361266401662647730,I was at the red piano for a Bachelorette Party for my coworker last Friday (Feb 1). We had a reservation for 10 people and when we got there (at 7pm) they had us split into two booths. It was very hard to talk to everyone and was fairly cramped in the booths. We asked to combine two tables together and were told that they were reserved for tables for 4 people. We then ordered dinner at 730 and did not receive our meals till 845 pm. We were all very hungry and did not have the patience to send back our cold food. We assumed why it took 1 hour and 45 mins to get our food (Spaghetti and meat balls and a burger) was due to wanting to charge us for the entertainment fee which was applied after 9pm. Our waitress was fairly tentative at the beginning and then we went almost 30 mins without seeing her, and had our empty plates in front of us for at least 30 mins. The entertainment was good though (dueling pianos), they were funny and interacted with the crowd very well.]
