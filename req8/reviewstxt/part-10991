[100990442883479710441,100747265098330634882,I moved to these Apartments back in 2010 and loved them. However as time went by the quality of service from the managment slowly degraded. I had set up contact information for my In Laws and my Father to have access in my absense but the staff quickly lost that info. When I had to deploy and left a timeframe when I would be gone they also forgot or lost that, saying they were trying to contact me through telephone when I had left them an email. Continous changes to aggreements and lackluster support from the staff makes this a irritating place to stay long.]
