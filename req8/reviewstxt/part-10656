[113004190112718342809,100729503602772785462,Without a doubt my favorite casino! Have been going there on a semi-regular basis for 3 years. Employees are always cheerful and polite, even the cleaning crew is nice with good attitudes. This tells me the management treats them reasonably well. Consistently sour and grumpy employees usually points to mistreatment and bad management, haven't seen that here. Always have a decent to great time there. My only complaint is that over the last year, their Falls Bar has been starting to develop a mold problem from all the moisture in the air from the water that runs down the window-walls to create the falls effect. I can smell it if I go in there to refresh my drink. If I want to hang out at a bar I just choose the Thunder or Mingles bar instead. Lots of roulette available, my favorite game.]
