[100793277750606128073,100575677198594183685,I have ordered a number of items over the years from Musicstore and I have always had some sort of problem with my orders. The worst case was about a year ago when I ordered stuff that I needed within two weeks which is a reasonable turnaround and when I heard nothing after a week and a half I emailed them and had no reply to emails. I lifted the phone and called them and was promised my order was ready to ship. I checked the status of my order online and it was CANCELLED!!! I called back several time to speak to the agent for Ireland and he was never available. I had more empty promises that someone would ring me back but the call never came. Avoid, shop local or if you have to order from Thomann.]
