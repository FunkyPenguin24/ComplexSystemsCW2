[101307638775553422311,100729580380766174751,I have bought a few vehicles from ATI, that I found first through newspaper ads. They were very helpful in giving me as much backround information as they could, for what I was looking at. These are used cars, so after doing inspections or work on the vehicles, they pretty much knew what was needed, and were honest about it. I like that. I picked up some good deals there. I even sent some of my friends over, and they are still driving around in the cars they bought.]
