[115014767307375600810,100888555277737186167,I really enjoyed my jump. The staff is nice, explained well how everything would go and joked around to release the tension. The waiting area was nice too with a canopy to stay in the shade. Only issue was that one of their plane was being repaired and they had a lot of people jumping so the wait was long. Be prepared to spend a while there.]
