[105994886315841431996,100240116305387353036,I've been going to Texas Dental for a year now. Dr. Ricci and his entire staff are all very fun people who are excellent at what they do. Between him and his assistant Julie, my recent root canal - of all things - turned out to be a very enjoyable experience.]
