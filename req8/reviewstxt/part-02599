[101493121808957977551,100293240644297453172,In 2003 bought a Golf and Frank Heinz was the sales person. He was the only sales person out of all the dealerships in the Metroplex, that told me no we don't have what you want, but I can have it here in a week. Every other dealer wanted to sell me whatever they had on the lot. True to his word he had it in a week later. I had done most of the paperwork financing via phone/fax. When I arrived, I was there 30 minutes tops and drove out with the EXACT car I wanted. I had good luck with the service department too. Now, my Golf is gone - but every dealer I have dealt with since is mentally compared to these guys. Only a couple come close to how easy it was. Thank you.]
