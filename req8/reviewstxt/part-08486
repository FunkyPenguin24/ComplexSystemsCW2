[106599974110691460845,100612945290805730126,Called on a Saturday morning and someone arrived about two hours later, in the middle of the time window quoted on the phone. The whole job took about 40 minutes; technician was nice and did a very conscientious job on both installation and cleanup. Very thoroughly vacuumed the interior and took the time to reassure my girlfriend about superficial damage to the door frame, which she appreciated. Would definitely recommend these guys. FYI $230 total to replace driver-side power window in a Subaru.]
