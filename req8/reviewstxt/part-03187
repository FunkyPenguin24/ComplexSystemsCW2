[111694628821949091359,100323256558261765397,I went here with a decent budget, nothing to brag about, but Jeff helped me out sooo much. I orginally looked at the used inventory online and found a 2011 Civic that I really liked so I scheduled a test drive. Iwent in and Jeff and his "shadow" walked me through everything I needed to know about the car. I left that day feeling good about my choice to come here. I returned a couple days later (due to thanksgiving) after I made an appointment with Jeff and his shadow again and we drove another 2011 Civic that was just a little more than I wanted to spend, but only had a few thousand miles on it. Not once did I feel pressured to buy the more expensive one. I decided to go with the original car I drove. I did have some hiccups with my insurance...well now former insurance company, but after I got that situated I left the lot with a beautiful new car and a great experience. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new car!]
