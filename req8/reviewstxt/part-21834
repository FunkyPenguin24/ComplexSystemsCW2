[106890512366400127114,100158286503628196321,I purchased a camera at this location 31 days ago and took it to Canada still new in the box. After 7 photos only half the screen worked the other side showed a white blank screen. I returned it to Frys and was told I needed to work it out with the manufacturer that they could not exchange it. The manager gave the impression he could care less and refused to discuss it any further. Let's see 5 minutes of usage and 7 photos and they feel they cannot back up a defective piece of merchandise as described by their service technicians. I feel that after the sale the customer becomes the enemy at this store.]
