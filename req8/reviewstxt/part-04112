[109700316835891236607,100376190844386150488,My husband and I made the switch to Dr. Marc about a year ago and we are very happy. His staff is warm and friendly. The office decore will make you forget you are at the dentist office. Dr. Marc is very professional, friendly, patient, and willing to answer all of your questions. All equipment is state of the art. During my four mollar extraction they had relaxing music and Dr. Marc walked me through it every step of the way to make sure I wasn't in any type of discomfort. Thanks to his bedside manner I was able to keep it together. He even allowed my husband to be present for extra comfort and Dr. Marc called me the next day to make sure I was doing okay. Thank you, Dr. Marc!]
