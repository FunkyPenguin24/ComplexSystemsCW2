[114851182833883485191,100585193303633436377,I was pleasantly surprised with this new dentist we chose that is on our insurance plan. Staff is great and friendly, I did not have to do anything concerning insurance, they verified all my coverages, and gave me my estimate cost for a root canal and a new crown on a chipped molar. The best part is that I showed up for my appointment 5 minutes early and did not have to wait which is a really nice change from any other dental or medical clinics I have used in the past. The root canal was a lot less scary than I thought it was going to be, I had a little bit of the nitros or what ever it is and was really comfortable. Unfortunately I accidentally bit down a bit to hard when they were fitting my temporary crown and cracked it.. it was my fault, but they were totally awesome and stayed with me until after hours to make sure that they could make me a new temporary and would be comfortable and have no issues until the new crown arrived in about a week. I chose a zirconia (sp?) crown with porcelain so it would be really strong and look real.. I was thrilled with the options and am very excited to get the Zoom whitening next week. We have made appointments for my wife and kids to come and get the annual checkups and cleanings. I highly recommend this dental office, So glad I found a place that actually cares.]
