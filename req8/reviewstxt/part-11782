[112981779061644681683,100789757675506912725,We are a private school in Abu Dhabi and wanted a professional system for our auditorium but couldn't afford to purchase all new equipment. Solaris helped us to locate the pieces we needed in a market that matched our requirements, contacted the seller and helped us to complete the sale and arrange for the documentation so that shipping could begin. When the product arrived, we were able to quickly clear customs and bring it to our site. We tested the items and found everything as described. We have since utilized our auditorium for many gatherings and the equipment we purchased through Solaris has performed as expected. We will definitely use Solaris' services for future equipment purchases! Aaron Grandon Merryland International School Abu Dhabi, UAE]
