[104096026751459605943,100433001671745631386,Rude front desk, uncaring doctor who just gave me antibiotics without checking to see what was actually wrong. I finished the antibiotics and only got worse, so I went to the nearby minute clinic at the CVS. The people there were kind, caring, and properly diagnosed pneumonia, then gave me the treatment plan. My suggestion, go to the CVS minute clinic nearby instead. Its cheaper, faster, nicer, and they act more like doctors.]
