[100510155196875564194,100200182928890434881,Probably the worst Post Office I've ever been to, makes me sad that all my bigger mail/packages goes to them. Never had an issue picking up a package on the day it was delivered (even though it says the package will be ready the following day, usually post offices will do this unless there is a reason why they can't). Went to pick up a TV, and the post office is part of a 7-11, and since the post office portion is small the mail often spills out into part of the 7-11. I can see my TV on the 7-11 floor, but they won't let me pick it up saying 'oh, if there wasn't a line of people, they would just process it and give me my TV' but instead they told me to 'come back later today and maybe we can do it'. I came back later, they still hadn't processed it, but they agreed to give it to me....taking far less time to just get me the TV than it took to tell me I couldn't have it previously. Seriously? I'm all for following the rules, but they blindly followed it for no reason, keeping my TV out in the middle of a 7-11. Its a weird feeling to be in a post office to pick up a package of MINE, be so close to MY TV that I can literally touch it, and NOT BE ABLE TO PICK UP MY MAIL just for the sake of it, being that, apparently, it doesn't take ANY EXTRA TIME to pick it up now, rather than later.]
