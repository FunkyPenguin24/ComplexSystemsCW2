[116299702058177760965,100023127947189771106,We love Caruso's. In fact we are going their tonight to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday, 11/12/13. The outside garden setting for dining is simply wonderful. It feels like you are in Italy. The food is good and reasonably priced. The staff is really friendly.]
