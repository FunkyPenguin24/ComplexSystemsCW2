[111108875139872655400,100975618435593844326,Stayed in this hotel after my previously arranged accommodation fell through. I wanted a single room with it's own bathroom, they had none available, but the Lady kindly offered me a triple room for the price of a single for one night. I asked to see the room before paying, just to see if I remotely liked it, at which point she became extremely rude & refused to let my friend look at the room with me, making him stay in reception. Apart from that, I was delighted with my stay, great price and good rooms, comfy bed & reliable shower. I would recommend this to anyone, now I do not know what the smaller rooms are like, but their price for a triple is still really reasonable for what you get.]
