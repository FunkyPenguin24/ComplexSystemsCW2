[103331884334300669525,100704957317010950838,The Shell gas station, I bought a full tank of gas and when I pulled out it completely made my engine sputter out and quit completely. Had to have it towed to a nearby mechanics shop and after checking everything possible they finally took my advice and emptied the fuel tank and lines and put new gas in and low and behold the car miraculously starts. so $600 later my car is working again. Also when my car originally sputter out after getting gas; a cop came to my aid since I was right off the interstate, and he called the tow truck for me. Anyways the police officer mentioned that there was 6 or 7 other vehicles that had just gotten gas from this station and had the exact same thing happen, so he took my name and phone number and license number, and date and time, due to a definate court case that was going to be taken against the station. So if you are smart I wouldn't ever get gas from this Shell gas station in 6416 State Highway 334 Whitestown, IN 46075.]
