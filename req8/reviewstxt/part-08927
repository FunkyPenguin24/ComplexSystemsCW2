[108274560581773419708,100634770413383495096,I take my maltepoo, Stormee, here almost on a daily basis. The staff is friendly, know my name and my dog's name by sight and are warm and welcoming. I like having the peace of mind that Stormee can be someplace and play all day and be cared for, rather than home alone while I'm at work. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a day camp for their pooch.]
