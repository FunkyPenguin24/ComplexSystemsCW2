[103413052581362468904,100251200231420416523,Rebuilt the transmission on my 2002 Accord. They finished the work within a week, and it's been running great. Al was very honest about the diagnostic, prognosis, repair costs, etc. and patient with my questions. I double checked all the facts & figures with our family mechanic from out of state, and he verified that Al was indeed completely honest. Later, he also did both front & rear brakes on the vehicle as well. If my car ever has a problem, my first call will be to Al.]
