[116989937351504920047,100117831735092015762,I wouldn't work for this company. Their ads are misleading, when I went to their job fair, all it mentioned was Amazon so I'm thinking I would work for Amazon. Come to find out its only a temp job, not permanent. Also, I was never told to bring in education proof. All I was told was to call in 2 weeks. That whole scene was like a cattle call, no organization whatsoever! I have told SMX I am not interested in working for a temp agency but I still am getting robo calls from them. I have talked to 3 people and told them the same thing yet, I'm still getting the calls!]
