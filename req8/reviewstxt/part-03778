[110609571011974753241,100357029979362155781,Elaina Adeniyi is awesome. I purchased a Volkswagen Farenheit in 2007 from the Evanston Autobarn and it has been one of the best purchases of my life. The car is flat out cool, fun to drive, reliable, and sturdy. Every employee of Autobarn has been good natured and competent. I've worked directly with Elaina Adeniyi on numerous occasions from the casual checkup to the random upgrade and she is excellent at what she does. I highly recommend Autobarn for a great car and an even better experience.]
