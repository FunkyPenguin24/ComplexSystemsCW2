[105885159642287135463,100848827477311961080,Actually used the University as a hotel when in Ottawa this past summer. Though there was lots of construction the staff were clear, the rooms were clean, the AC worked GREAT, the food system and the quality of the food was amazing. Highly recommend it for those holidaying in Ottawa. Lots of public transit access to the rest of the city including amazing bike paths that lead everywhere. Plus the Target has just opened up so if you want to prepare food in your rooms to keep costs down you have a stove, microwave, fridge and table with chairs separate from your sleeping areas. Ideal for families with TV lounges just down the hall. AND you get to watch the troops that do the changing of the guard practice cause they stay on campus.]
