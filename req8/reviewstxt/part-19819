[104284285481188735027,100050679796724533880,Do NOT rent a boat from this marina. We just came back from a week long experience where we were given a boat that, to my mind, was unsafe. The Carbon Monoxide detectors went off every time we turned on the generator (which we were told should be left on at least 16 hours a day....how convenient....uses a gallon of gas an hour). Every carbon monoxide detector went off in the boat. We had someone come out (who we had to call on our phones because the ship to shore radio didn't work) and they told us it was just weak batteries. Then another person came out and told us to ask for an upgrade. When I turned the boat in I spoke to the manager and she said "mam, these detectors are very sensitive, you were never in any danger." Really? SO I should have just gone to bed with three carbon monoxide detectors going off? This is a tragic accident waiting to happen.]
