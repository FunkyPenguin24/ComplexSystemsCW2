[108813217768136165124,100066748685548091248,I have had a number of used motors serviced by B&M over the past decade or two. If the motor is on a boat it is necessary to be careful about being able to get it out of their way once it is done. However, my motors have always performed well upon completion or, in one case, the work was redone at no cost. I bring motors for service from some distance because of the excellence of their work. Most maintenance and repairs are within my own skill range. However, if a few years go by without problems on a specific motor I bring it to B&M simply because Fred is a great mechanic and will find problems before they trouble me. The marine shop is good sized and has most of what I need for boating and trailering at reasonable prices. What isn't immediately available can usually be ordered and available within a day or two. They will also ship to my house. These folks know what they are doing and do it well.]
