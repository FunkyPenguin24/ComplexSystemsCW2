[117040291608408725068,100286735440531214391,We have been taking both cars to Sahlani Brothers for almost 3 years and they have yet to disappoint us. They are honest, reliable, and have reasonable prices. Jim Sahlani also greets you like an old friend and seems very genuine about it. The only thing I would change is adding some mechanism for earlier morning drop-offs (8 am is tough with our work hours). Overall we feel so lucky to have identified a mechanic we like and trust.]
