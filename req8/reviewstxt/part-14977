[100304052415702953336,100965695170252914744,I used to eat Chipotle a lot, but it was never a great place to go for me, and was really only tolerable. I would usually only go when a big group of us went. One day, however, I discovered Qdoba, and I haven't been able to eat Chipotle since. I finally discovered good food at Qdoba, and I couldn't tolerate the cardboard tortillas, plastic chicken, dirt beef, or Styrofoam chips from Chipotle any more. As a company, they do some neat things, like canned food drives and sustainable, cruelty-free ranching, but it doesn't make the final product any better, and they have a very limited selection of food options as well. I know a lot of people who love Chipotle and hate Qdoba, but those same people also love to eat glass, so I don't put much faith in their taste buds. My recommendation: try it once, then try Qdoba once, and get the same thing at both places (so you'll be limited to a burrito, and you won't be able to try any of the other amazing products Qdoba has on top of that until later).]
