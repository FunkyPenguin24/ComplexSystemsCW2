[115912562225708768013,100715655521039279826,Wow, 1 star is too kind. They screwed me over SO BADLY it makes me puke. I work across the street, went to get my oil changed since I've done it there 10+ times. I asked them to call when the car is ready and leave the key in the car. They said it was no problem, bit they did neither. So after work, I went to my car, no key and they were closed and would be closed all day Sunday, the next day so I was stranded in a parking lot with no car for over a day because they were too lazy to call before they left for the weekend. They also put the oil cap on wrong causing a leak. Go ANY WHERE else but here.]
