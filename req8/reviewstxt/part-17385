[115965630275670985230,101096720997125338313,It's Saturday evening, 9am and it's me and my daughter. She's having butter chicken and I'm having chicken tandoori (hot), malagawtani soup with a mango lassi. There are only 2 other tables with customers which is nice for us. The food has always been really good here so hopefully it will be delicious now!]
