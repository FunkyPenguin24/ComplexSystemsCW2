[101317996181887598127,100770691799137032015,We love the library!! It has TONS of books, music, and movies. We have been able to check out new releases easily; also, we request books, CDs and movies from other libraries and they come quickly. We also love how late it stays open, til 9pm. We go to the Rec Center and then the library all throughout the week. Also, love the easy self-check-out, with plenty of computers to check our stuff out.]
