[102599501614114720532,100410835071791922316,Got to take their four hour Kite Boarding ground school yesterday - well worth the time. They walk you through the basics, teach safety and provide advice. Then we went to the beach and practiced kite flying and setup. The ground school will make the first lesson / attempt at this sport much easier. Best of all - can't beat the price...Free! The whole Team are knowledgable, enthusiastic and a lot of fun. Highly recommend the shop.]
