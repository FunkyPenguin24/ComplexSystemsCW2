[100657754367015889474,100393123863410673751,I wanted to quickly share that I had a great experience learning about the Pharmacy program. I am hoping to get into the program at Roseman so that I can stay living here in Utah so fingers crossed. The admissions person (I forget her name) was super helpful with all of the information she sent to me. Great experience.]
