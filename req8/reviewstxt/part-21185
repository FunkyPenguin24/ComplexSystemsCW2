[111037883519406973130,100122261052174060052,Mark provides a very impressive sales experience. He listens to what you want and helps you understand what you will and won't like about the vehicles he sells. I test drove vehicles at 8 dealers and he was, by far, the most helpful. Vehicles have become so complicated that sales people really need to listen to what you are looking for to know what parts of the vehicle they need to direct you to. I test drove an MDX at another dealer and felt it was a sloppy drive. Then I found out it has an adjustable suspension (though Mark) and figured out I loved it. I'm super happy with the car, and with Mark's help I know how the functions work that are meaningful to me.]
