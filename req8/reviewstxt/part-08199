[114762951903357954203,100598575087532704146,I took my son to Doctors Express for an earache. I was in and out of there in less than 20 min! the staff was very professional and the doctor was great. The office was very clean and up to date. Most importantly I loved that they open at 8 am when other urgent care facilities do not open until 11 or later!]
