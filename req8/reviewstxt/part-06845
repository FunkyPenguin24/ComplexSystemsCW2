[103389435634181916316,100524449976975810997,From the outside we thought it was just an everyday diner. It is actually very nice inside. The food is great and the atmosphere is cozy and romantic. My husband and I love having date night there and it isnt over priced at all. Definitely a hidden Downriver Gem!!]
