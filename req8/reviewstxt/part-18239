[111595242846544197091,101142607688278764703,I believe this company is run by a bunch of unsavory people who are out to take advantage of unsuspecting customers. I also believe used car companies purposely reset emission codes in the auto to kill the check engine light during the sales process. I went to this dealership to buy a car from my daughter and was mortified at how in the end I was duped. I directly asked John who is unethical and operates in pathological dishonesty in my opinion. if I would have any trouble passing the emissions test. He gave this long song and dance about how the company doesn't operate like that and they have been in business 17years blah blah blah. Two days after my daughter had the auto the check engine light comes on. What used car dealerships do is simply disconnect the battery cable and this will erase the codes in turn the check engine light will go off only to come back on after an extensive drive cycle has been completed and the illuminated light will not be seen during the test drive. John told me to my face that this would not happen. I have never in my life felt so lied to and taken advantage of. I would advise anyone to stand clear of this place. Unsuspecting to John prior to coming In I spoke financial crimes and they are very interested in the unsavory operations of dealerships like this. With all the power in me I will bring this practice to an end. Also State Senator Nina Turner is very interested in companys who prey on the community with underhanded tactics.]
