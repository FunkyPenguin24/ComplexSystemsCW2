[108395378757394001967,100792954632252803141,Worst restaurant I have ever eaten in. Bad service, bad food and a bad atmosphere (it was overrun with lesbians). If you're in Galveston, TX - steer clear of this Joe's Crabshack - the one on Harborside Drive. None of the staff acted like they liked their job. It was like pulling teeth to get any service. The food was delivered to our table cold. One of our meals was a steak that appeared to have been boiled a few days prior and then seared on a grill for a minute to give it a grilled appearance. It was not edible.]
