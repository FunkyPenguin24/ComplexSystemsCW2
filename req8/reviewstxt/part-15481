[114114486150846242206,100992404961734791668,Horrible experience. The ride to the airport was driven recklessly and the van must not have had any shock absorbers. I thought I'd hurt my back but it turned out to be just a momentary pain. That turned out to be the best part of the experience. We had exactly an hour's wait to get picked up on our return trip 10/14/2012, despite calling 4 times. We were told something different each time and were given a completely different excuse by the driver. The person answering the phone was rude and hung up on me when I expressed exasperation at the delay and conflicting excuses. When we were checking out of the lot, we were offered 2 free days and that was nice, but it did not make up for the one hour delay and I will never UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE use Rocket again.]
