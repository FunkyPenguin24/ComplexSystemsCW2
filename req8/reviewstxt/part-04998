[103098661424841067268,100423021275246203202,Reviews from two years ago and a previous location are still true. The name Flashback, with emphasis on ice cream/fountain, creates expectations of a festive, energetic experience that recalls a 1950s soda fountain shop. My experience was the opposite. The place looked drab and no employees seemed enthusiastic. Since these were the consensus of the two year old reviews, I suspect the problem begins with apathetic owners. The shake was good, but it's hard to enjoy when you're in a depressing setting. Sad and drab are the most descriptive words for this place, and I don't plan on doing this to myself again. I hope that someone there realizes that they can create an experience that customers would thoroughly enjoy, especially on vacation, and begin creating that instead of the sad experience that is currently offered.]
