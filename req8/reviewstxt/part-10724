[112814971404176087784,100732626619103117948,Lisa planned and put together an amazing trip to Cabo for a bachelor party of 22 of my Fraternity brothers. Getting all my brothers together and on board for this trip was easy but making sure we all get our passports and payments cleared is another thing. Lisa has stayed in contact with all of us as the trip gets closer to make sure we all have everything ready. Being one of the planners in this group of guys, I'm so thankful for Lisa and pro travel. I never could have planned something so extravagant and have it run as smooth as it has. As a group we are extremely excited to celebrate one of brothers getting married and since everything is taken care of all we have to do is show up. THANKS LISA!!!!!!]
