[105124906909615426791,100466909896804351610,Service by workers was great but they couldn't get my card to run thru even with the driver there listening to my call and knowing i had more than enough money in the back the office worker was belittling and yelling for him to get the money, did i mention it was to bring my fiance to see me in the VA hospital after being hurt on the job, company has no sympathy and don't deserve anyone's service if they cant keep their cool with a Veteran in the Hospital]
