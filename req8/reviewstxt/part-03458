[111547458911340012693,100338383512047610025,A friend of mine introduced me to the outlaw a while back. And I have been going back regularly. It is a great place to hang out and watch the game or visit with friends. You can even make new friends. The only drawback to this place is there are so many choices for cigars that I have a terrible time making a choice on which I want. One great thing is the staff is very knowledgeable on all their products so if you don't know just ask and someone there will help.]
