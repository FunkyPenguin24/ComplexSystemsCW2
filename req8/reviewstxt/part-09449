[106634936809262715776,100663705752409480029,Located at Mutiara Damansara, in the middle of Curve, right opposite Ikea. Good place to stay if you're from other states and you're looking to shop at Ikea. Not to be confused with "The Royale Bintang Mutiara Damansara", which is at the western end of the Curve (just beside e-Curve mall) Plenty of restaurants, places to drink, and entertainment options all within walking distance. Ingress players will be glad to know that there are at least 20 portals all within walking distance of this hotel :D]
