[107733459194397071636,100450814757828633945,My son started karate when he was 5 years old and shortly thereafter I began training with him. Together we learned about karate, improved our physical conditioning and bonded as father and son. Faust's USA Karate is a family oriented dojo with flexible training hours and supportive instructors that inspire and encourage karateka of all levels. The training environment enables students to learn and progress at their own rate earning their way to a Black Belt. Additional seminars are often held that feature guest sensei who train in multiple styles. In addition to training students engage in community service and work to maintain high academic standards. My son is now a focused, confident, mature, high school senior. Several years ago we earned our Black Belts and continue to train to maintain our physical fitness and focus. Practicing martial arts provides a holistic approach to mental and physical training (cardio, strength, flexibility). I highly recommend Faust's USA Karate for people of all ages and abilities.]
