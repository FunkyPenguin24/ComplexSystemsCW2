[115759745698611842540,100576446784657252444,Fun for Everyone! Wow! I'm so excited! I just took my boys (8 & 10) to Dead Broke and we had SUCH a great time. First the farm is beautiful and the horses all so well kept and friendly. When we arrived it was an animal lovers dream. Sweet little dogs, TURKEYS, peacocks and even a MINATURE PONY, my little boy wanted to take him home. We got organized and rode through beautiful scenic trails, my horse was so kind and gentle he responded to all my requests (and I'm not experienced), the boys horses were sweet and responsive and the ride was so smooth and relaxing. NO worries at all! I LOVED it SO much, I've invited my friend with two little girls to go back in December! It's so nice to show children fun w/o a television! I"m sold will go back and recommend to all of my friends!]
