[101551539612394448426,100087811735914735735,It’s a diner ! (And that’s a good thing) Riki’s Family Restaurant offered a typical local diner experience – extremely fast service, typical diner food with a mix of some homemade specialties (homemade soups, authentic turkey), a great local clientele base, and just like many established diners; a no frills environment with some outdated décor. These are all good things if you enjoy local diners -- and we’ll be back ! But, if you are not a fan of local diners then you may want to try another place.]
