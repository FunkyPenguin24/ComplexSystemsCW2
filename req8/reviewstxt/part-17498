[104771734288716519563,101102959428587635147,New to the area and decided to try Raj Mahal. I wasn't let down. The meal my husband and i ordered was delicious. The meat was tender and moist and there was not too much pepper. The chapati was lovely along with the naan and fluffy pilau rice. Such great food and right on my doorstep!!]
