[101642147890988229944,100099815784896706921,The staff is rude at best. If it were not for the fact that the bride loved the bridesmaids dresses so much we would have went elsewhere and in the long run we should have!! One of the dresses came in the wrong color, the wedding is in 2 weeks and we still don't have the dress. They keep us on hold for at least 20-30 min EVERY TIME we call and when they finally get back on the line they are rude and condescending. Mistakes happen and I am not a complainer normally BUT they are so rude about the situation and given that weddings are stressful enough I would NOT recommend anyone getting there dresses here!!]
