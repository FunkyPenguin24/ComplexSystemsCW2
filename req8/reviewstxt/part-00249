[110126087803515624077,100172080675193058071,Waited an hour to get someone to take the phone. Was told they'll call in 3 hours. Left the store and 5 hours later no call. Went back to the store and waited another hour just to meet the super tech Guillermo. Mr. Guillermo said the phone runs HOT b/c of many apps installed on the phone EVEN THOUGH if the phone is OFF. Hmm... Sprint sure hired some brilliant techs. Mr. Guillermo almost lost his temper b/c I was trying to educate him. Stomped away and slammed the door. Very Professional. A+ for fail.]
