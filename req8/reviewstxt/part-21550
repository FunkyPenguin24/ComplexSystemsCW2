[105465110703981307944,100142402223737326005,I called them yesterday evening because I needed some work done on an circuit breaker panel as well as a hot water heater. They said that they could do all of that and scheduled someone to come out the following morning. I then called them back to confirm that the person would be a certified electrician, and they said that they would be. The next morning, at the time the guy was supposed to have been here, I get a call from Mr. Handyman stating that they don't have licensed plumbers or electricians so can't do either of the jobs I asked about. I ask him why they then said that they do, and he said that was their "answering service". Add in the fact that they charge $146 for the first hour and $96/hour after that, which is a lot for not even being licensed plumbers or electricians, and Mr. Handyman definitely gets a 1 star...]
