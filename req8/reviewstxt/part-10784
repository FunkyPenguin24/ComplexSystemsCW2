[112066379869824021557,100735398383509010462,My wife and I recently worked with Rene Ruiz while purchasing our first home and we couldn't be happier. Rene is a phenomenal agent working with a great company. Being first-time homebuyers, we constantly had concerns and questions. Rene was always willing to answer and explain matters in a detailed, and insightful, manner. Rene and Realty Austin are a great choice if you're looking to buy a home. We will definitely be looking to work with them in the future!]
