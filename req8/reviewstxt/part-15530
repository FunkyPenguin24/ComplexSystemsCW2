[114960282951421873237,100995687860358278738,I get my haircut by Mike. I heard he was a period haircut specialist, so I went in and got a sweet 30's military cut (he talked me out of fifties because of my hair type). Super era accurate; I trusted him and it was an awesome cut. But then I had to be in a wedding, so I went back in two weeks later and he and I worked out how to tone it down a bit. I couldn't be happier - still classic, but not so extreme. And he does it all in about 10 - 15 minutes, including clean up. That combined with online booking makes this an easy way to look the way you want.]
