[102469861858578264104,100036597365779673203,I've been going to the Bikesmith for years now. I have always been very happy with the quality of service, the genuine and friendly staff, and the great communication about what my bike needs. The owner, Jon, and his staff clearly love bikes and have a great can-do attitude about even the most challenging request. It doesn't hurt that they have experience fabricating custom bicycles from scratch. If you care about your bike, this shop is where you should take it.]
