Wednesday is the day the fresh fruit and vegetables arrive. The only meat here is frozen. Nice selection of frozen foods and a great liquor aisle. A superb selection of (East) Indian foods. Sunday hours are ridiculously brief. No grocery shopping day on St. Kitts is complete without having to visit all 3 grocery stores as each has some of the items you need but not all of the items you need.]
