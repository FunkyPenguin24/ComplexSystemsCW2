[114952379284925423905,100128065085252873973," DR QUINN AND HIS OFFICE STAFF WERE VERY PROFESSIONAL, HELPFUL, CONSIDERATE, AND THOROUGH. I GOT THE ORTHO CARE I NEEDED - AND NOW MY MOUTH FEELS BETTER - WITH MY ISSUED ADDRESSES: TEETH STRAIGHTENED WITH RETAINERS, CLENCHING ADDRESSED WITH MOUTH GUARD, AND A ORTHO TEAM ESTABLISHED (AT MY AGE) SO I CAN CHECK BACK IN WHEN NEEDED. I HAD NOT BEEN TO ORTHO APPT SINCE MY TEENS - SO HARD TO COME BACK - BUT THIS TEAM MADE IT VERY WORTHWHILE, TOOK CARE OF ALL THE PAPERWORK, AND MADE SURE I WAS HAPPY. THANK YOU "]
