[114956246784647808047,100894728282545819524,It has been 8 years since purchasing a new vehicle and that by itself can be very tedious and taxing but I can certainly say that my experience in purchasing another car was very pleasant and most of all informative. Tony broke down the numbers for me that made so much sense which alllowed me to maximize my money's worth in the vehicle in which I purchased (2013 Honda Civic LX). Tony is very knowlegable in what he knows and he exudes that through his passion which he showed the entire time. I would not hesitate to send referrals to him by any means. The attributes that he displayed are the ones that I esteem highly in a world of Customer Service. I also had the opportunity to work with Mr. Hawkins on the finance side of the house and my experience with him was pleasant as well. Overall from 0 to 10, my experience has been rated at a 10. Again, Boyd Auto thanks for your kindness, it will certainly go along ways.]
