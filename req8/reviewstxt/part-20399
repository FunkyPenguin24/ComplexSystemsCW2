[106892445352475907202,100081006644879388557,Jared Pela kept an eye out for a vehicle I was looking for, and once he let me know, he made the transaction as smooth as possible. He was very professional and genuinely concerned about my needs. Thanks to Brian Boyd for being friendly and creative in finding ways for me to finance! I'd say they make a really good team. The car business is a tough business, but they made it look easy by being so knowledgeable. Thanks, Guys.]
