[111924720836320092818,100674956398598347470,I recently purchased a 2004 jeep grand cherokee and decided to take it in and have it looked at to see what type of maintenance needed to be done and if there were any issues. On my way there, both my husband and I used our windows while smoking and the dash was fine. However, after the dealers inspection my windows, locks, guages and alarms are no longer working. I asked them to fix it being the vehicle was working when I brought it in and I was told no, that if I wanted it fixed it would be over $300.00. I have never been treated that way in my life. I was told that the tech must have done it while opening the doors, but that it's a common problem with this model jeep. Maybe if he would have gentle then it wouldn't have happened. Funny that all week long I drove it without an issues at all but all of a suddent 3 wires are broke? Even looks like one was cut or spliced. I feel as though this was done on purpose in hopes to get additional money out of me. I was refered to them from a friends but will never, ever, ever go back. Terrible customer service and they wrecked my car. What type of dealership doesn't fix an issue they caused. Then I get a dang voicemail from the manager saying he hopes my visit went well. Really? I left crying- how well do you think it went? ..grrrrr]
