[101596437690277172833,100494102673327587532,I came to the Foundry to have a meeting with one of the owners. Apon my arrival, a lovely girl met me at the door and greeted me warmly. Afer explaining why I was there, she showed me to the new bistro area to wait on a big couch. After advising the owner I had arrived, she came immeadiately back, offered me a coffee and updated me on what was happening. I was really impressed with the service standard and effeciency, the attention to detail and the comfort of the venue. Every thing is clean and brand new. Very impressive.]
