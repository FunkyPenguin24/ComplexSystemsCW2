[100212019661630984156,100852035309792548127,After doing much research on many vehicles, I found one that I wanted at Mark Christopher. I like the instant messaging on the website to chat with a sales person without picking up the phone. I got to ask about the vehicle I was interested in, and get my questions answered before travelling an hour and half to the dealership. Scott McDonough was very professional, low pressure and helped us through the process as quickly as possible on a busy holiday weekend. I would say that was the easiest car buying experience I have ever had. Thank you.]
