[114077120218142037929,100993692045845436681,Dr. Mills combines the book-knowledge of a doctor -- with the common sense of a smart man -- with the puzzle-solving skills of a scientist. He also has good people skills, and uses it to casually chat with me just enough to take in the 'whole picture' of my life (general health/stress/relationships, etc.) before making a diagnosis or recommendation. I usually spend an average amount of time that you would expect to wait in a doctors office--- he's definitely busy but I never wait too long. He seems to understand time management and spends just the right amount of time with me to obtain the answers to his questions before diagnosis, and still leaves time to answer my questions without rush. The reception area is not the slick, high-dollar reception areas that you see in all these new urgent care-type facilities -- but it is clean and comfortable; it is the feel of an old-school family doctor's office (which I like). Also, based on his health appearance, he seems to practice what he preaches. (I would much rather bet on a doctor who looks in good health him/herself, instead of a doctor who is overweight or has sallow skin.) Dr. Mills' health appearance is A-1. In fact, I might mistake him for a surfer, if I ever see him near the beach!]
