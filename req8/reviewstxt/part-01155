[102451156649722735809,100219218456672834768,I bought a pair of Cressi fins from Nanko about a month and a half ago and after only about 6 dives they cracked at the toe box. I liked the fins so I went back to buy another pair and when the owner saw what happened to my first pair he swapped them out no questions asked. So glad to see a shop that stands behind their products! When it comes time to buy a speargun I will be buying it from Nanko]
