[101596169556480015895,100887918881142592168,These are my friends. I will NEVER eat there again until this issue is addressed: Hire at will, fired over a cookie? Pat yourself on the back for living on food stamps for a week Panera CEO. Your company is one of the causes of poverty. My step daughter loyally covered shifts, arrived promptly and did her job well. For months. Never reprimanded for anything. Then......a customer comes in, orders a cookie. Shelby gets her a cookie. Customer returns to counter and complains its broken. Shelby kindly apologizes and gets her another cookie. Then, the customer writes a letter and complains that Shelby didn't give her a HOT cookie. I return home from work (I'm disabled after breaking my back) to find my child crying. Fired over a cookie. Priceless. How does a 17 year old child find another job after being fired for a cookie? How can your "manager" sleep at night knowing she screwed a child saving for college over a cookie? This letter will get me no where. I don't care. I just wanted someone from your corporation to read how disgusting one of your managers treats their employees. SHAME ON YOU!!!!]
