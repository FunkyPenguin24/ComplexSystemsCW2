[116618537211965888035,100536424334628721583,We had a Christmas Party at the Toad n Turtle in Airdrie and the food was absolutely amazing. Best prime rib we have had in a long time. That night the food was comparable to something you would eat at the Fairmont Hotel in Banff. Top notch food. Definitely the best place in Airdrie to have a Party!]
