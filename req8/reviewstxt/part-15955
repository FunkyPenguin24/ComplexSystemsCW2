I feel they need to work on it, I ordered pork fried rice, chicken and pork eggroll twice and have yet to been satisfied. Everything is cook too long because it's hard and dry. I will not eat here a third time around. I will stick with Tops China in Savannah off Skidaway I've been eating them for over 4 years and have yet to be disappointed.""]
