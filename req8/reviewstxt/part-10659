[116733923287633676689,100729680922068631749,Most people in the country had never heard of Moore, Oklahoma before yesterday. Plaza Towers Elementary School was not part of our lives. That all changed. We pray for you, we mourn for you. We have no words that might lift the burden on your hearts for even an instant. May the peace that only God can provide, sustain all of you through this tragedy. The emptiness of your loss will always be there, but through everlasting life with Christ Jesus in Heaven, someday, your lives will again be whole!]
