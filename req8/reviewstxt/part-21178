[112971324360103510381,100121991868655302469,A simple wrap place, good options, including house-made hummus. Wraps have flavor and sauce without being a drippy mess. They may be the only dessert option, but at 2 for a dollar, the brownies are a good deal. They're basic chocolate sheet brownies, but with some large walnuts and dried cherries dropped on top. The lunch specials let you substitute brownies for fries!]
