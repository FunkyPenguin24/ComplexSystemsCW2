[110033623372661950329,100563294418085952240,The restaurant is named after the Biggest mountain in Thailand. Although this restaurant is not to the scale of the mountain, the owners Chris and Busarsa more than make up for this lack of size. A warm welcome should have been the start of a great night but was unfortunately its peak (not a pun) Whilst the ground floor looked more inviting we were sat alone on the first floor and with its cavernous roof was not a comfortable place to dine. Drink orders were taken quickly but had to wait an age for the drinks to finally arrive. Again starters took and age and were quite nice. Mains appeared within a minute of starters disappearing, which was a bit disconcerting. The green curry was well presented, if not small, but lacked any depth of flavour compared to the same dish in other venues. The bill for a bottle of wine, 2 starter, 2mains with rice, no dessert came to almost Â£70! Fine for exceptional service and wonderful food, but not for the middle of the road meal we received at the Doi Intanone.]
