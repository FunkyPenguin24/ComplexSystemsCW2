[115909277924742319120,100695196436635640612,We had a very , very good experience with Ingrid. I found the vehicle I was looking for online and we started corresponding that way. The response was prompt, and all of my questions were answered. We are from out of state and I was concerned with how smooth the whole experience would be. My concerns were quickly dismissed. We had been at another dealership here in WI. on Friday, and ended up leaving, the customer service was less than desirable. From the first email Ingrid sent me, to her staying late to finish our deal, everything went better than we could have expected. We were in and out of the dealership with our new vehicle in two hours. Elmhurst Toyota is by far one of the best experiences we have had buying a vehicle. We will be back !! Thank you Ingrid for your excellent customer service!]
