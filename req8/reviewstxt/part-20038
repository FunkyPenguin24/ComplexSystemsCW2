[109588294435375847381,100062463315077375601,I purchased a 2010 Macbook Air from my company last year which came with Apple Care thru August 2014. Fast-forward to last month...my Air screen started to go out and it was determined that the logic board was the issue. Needless to say, they changed it twice and it did not remedy the problem. Disgusted, I went into the store and demanded the manager and explained the issue. The manager was great (Brandon Slay). He acknowledged they replaced everything on the Air and gave me a new one on the spot...I know people give these guys a hard time and bad rating; however, they are doing their full due diligence before they can issue a new computer...I really appreciate the personal care received by the whole Apple team...kudos]
