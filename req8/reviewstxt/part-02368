[112754059870250259112,100280884872535004729,My husband, Erik, and I chose Tara for our wedding photographer. We got married in a town just north of Boston, MA. Tara was such a pleasure to work with. She made the planning easy, and the day-of, I knew I didn't need to worry about a thing. Our pictures are fantastic - and there are so many! It was so hard to choose our enlargements because they're all frame worthy! I highly recommend Tara, and wish she still lived close by!]
