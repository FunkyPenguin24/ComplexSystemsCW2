[105708001059879318774,100585825823733806989,I have had the worst experience!! I never thought i would be so stressed out with buying a car. First of all i traveled 3 hours to go to carmax because i had heard great things. (mind you i was with my 10 month old daughter) I previously spoke with the associates weeks in advance before i went up there and they assured me i was approved and all i needed to do was come in and sign the papers. Well that was NOT the case!! I went in and spend all day going back and forth with these people (with a baby!!) finally at 9:00 at night they tell me i will have to come back tomorrow. so i drove 3 hours home then 3 hours back the next day.(with my child!!) Finally i picked the car up and thought my headache was over. WELL IT WASNT!!! two weeks later my check engine light comes on and they are telling me that they documents they scanned in were not clear.So i had to resend EVERYTHING all over again! To make it worst this dragged out for almost a month. I never heard anything back from them so I called up to the dealership and asked if everything was ok. I was assured by The manager that everything was ok and i would recieve all my paperwork in the mail. So finally i thought this nightmare is over. NOPE!!!! After another month of not getting anything in the mail i call to figure out were to send my payment in ( a month and a half i have had this car) Now the Manager Ellen tells me that i am still not approved because someone put the wrong social in the computer ( best not to point fingers just try to solve the problem the lady tells me) So at a time were i drove to Tx to be with my family because i had a loved one pass away and my aunt had her baby, I have to deal with this car sales nightmare!! I think these people are untrustworthy and have no idea how to do good business. I would not recommend this place to my enemy!!]
