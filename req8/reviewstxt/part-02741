[110416165760144932879,100299969435587978137,Went first time for any Bengali food. My friend and I ordered sizzling Rupchanda and Spicy Chicken Masala.Both were very spicy and delicious. We ordered Mango Lassi with it too. It was well complemented with the *kick* in dishes. The portion size is big and they also served salad with it.The food we ate could easily be shared among 3 people.We also got complimentary chocolate in the end. We paid Â£24 in total. The service is quick and the dishes is well cooked.The staff is polite. Place is clean and tidy and the aura is comforting too. I really liked the restaurant and going back for Hilsha some other time. A bit pricey but good value for money. MUST RECOMMENDED. :)]
