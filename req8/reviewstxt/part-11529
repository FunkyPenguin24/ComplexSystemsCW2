[101396781319637310440,100775209990306851371,I LOVE this place. The location is great, food is amazing, and the decor is clean, modern and fresh. It is a great place to have business meetings have a drink with your girlfriends at the bar! The 817 Club Salad is my favorite, but I am very eager to try their Fried Chicken with Siracha butter.... I just might go try that today! Another great item on the menu is the baked potato salad! Everything you get on a loaded baked potato, but its in potato salad form. Who can resist that!? If you haven't been here before, check it out with a group of your friends, and you won't be disappointed!]
