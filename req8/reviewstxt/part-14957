[118176442586572853165,100964697179613756830,Brilliant local store, the staff are very friendly and very honest and helpful with vasts amounts of knowledge about Bikes and accessories. I have had a few services done to my bike through themselves and bought various accessories and been very happy with the service and price. A family member also recently got a Trek 29er off them and was given advice, had the bike setup to suit her, shown how to change the tyres, recommend configurations etc. Will be going back on regular occasions for services, parts & accessories. Well worth a visit whether your looking to get into biking or to upgrade your kit.]
