[109988222692561343944,100884919872380828411,I hired Peter to clean up a green pool and replace a timer on my pool pump. Peter did a decent job in cleaning up the pool that had been sitting for about three years and brought it up to the point where it was swimmable again. The process took about three weeks, a little longer than you might find with a comparable pool company, and I often felt like I had to call him repeatedly in order to get him to show up to do the work. There were also a number of times when he would promise to come and work on the pool on a certain date, and not show up. The pool was cleaned, but I learned the hard way that you get what you pay for. The replacement of my pool pump timer was another issue. He supposedly replaced the gears on my pool pump timer with "used parts" to save me money. Needless to say, the "used parts" didn't work at all. When I brought this to his attention, he promised that he would purchase me new timer mechanics, and refund me the cost of the "used parts". Weeks go buy, and no fix/refund. So I give him a call, and he tells me that he has the parts and that he will fix the timer by the end of the week. Two weeks go by without a fix. I call him, and he ignored my call. So I called him from a second phone, and he answered immediately. He then suggested that I go somewhere else to get my pool timer fixed. When I asked about a refund, he informed me that he would send it to me. When I asked when I could expect the refund, he hung up on me. I'll adjust this review, when/if I receive my refund. If not, I will have to agree with the other reviewers...use caution. Spend the extra money for someone who will follow through with their promises.]
