[103248550065406686241,100617807798350337511,My new husband and I had the great pleasure to have Mark be our photographer for our wedding. We chose Mark because his pictures were amazing and made the other wedding photographers look mediocre in comparison. We knew he was the one for us and we were not disappointed by any means. Mark and team did whatever they could to work with us and accommodate what we needed and wanted. We opted out of having engagement pictures done and instead did a Trash the Dress session which was more fun then we could have imagined. Mark's excitement for it only made the experience better for us because it made us more excited seeing how much he was getting into it. I highly recommend Mark to anyone who really wants their wedding story told in an amazing and beautiful way. We have fabulous pictures now to be able to cherish our wedding for years to come. You will not be disappointed if you choose Mark and team.]
