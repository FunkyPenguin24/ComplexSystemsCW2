[112287239776772379116,100618172075611807960,INFOFIT has been more than a wonderful experience for me! 10 years ago I became a single parent and was working full time. I knew I needed to further my education to support my kids! INFOFIT provided the perfect opportunity for my situation. I could go to school on weekends and do my apprenticeship program at my own pace. Today I am a very successful trainer with a full time career in an industry that I love! I am able to provide for my family and be happy doing it! Thanks INFOFIT for being there for me and being such a huge part of my awesome career! You guys are the best!]
