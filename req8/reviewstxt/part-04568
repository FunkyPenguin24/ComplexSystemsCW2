[116786190132772175804,100402472367900972899,The High School in Forest Grove is full of a bunch of Tool BOXES. More nonsense than anything. It is what you make of it. There's only a handful of teachers there that are worth excluding entirely from this negative review besides that there's nothing really at all to like about this dumb sorry excuse for a school... I'm excited as heck to finally be done with this school and get as far away as possible. If you give this school five stars your wrong and must be doing heroine.]
