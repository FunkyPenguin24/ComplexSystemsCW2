I can't believe that a manager had the audacity to argue semantics of an incorrect drink order instead of fixing the situation. It was so unprofessional. We had a table of nine people. We will not be back and you will exponentially lose business because of how we were treated. The atmosphere is schizophrenic. It is like being at two separate restaurants at the same time. Literally half the restaurant is a bar and the other side looks like a tex Mex shit-hole that is trying to class itself up to no avail. The bar plays top 40 music way too loud while they are yelling out bingo numbers. And the other side is playing Michael Bubl√©, also very loudly. We didn't get any food for over an hour, probably because they assigned us a new server after 20 min. When one person from our table went over to the bar area to get some of the complimentary popcorn for the table to snack on, he was chased down as a bar server tried to grab it out of his hands. We were yelled at and humiliated, as he told us we were not allowed to eat popcorn. When we asked for a manager he continued to argue. The manager came over and told us that the waiter had forgotten to put our order in, but assured us it would be coming. The waiter asked if I would like soup or salad when I ordered, so I asked for a salad. When the bill came they charged me full price for the salad and when I questioned it he told me my meal didn't come with a salad. The manager told us she would be bringing us free desserts, but never did. She also said she would fix the bill for us, but the waiter still brought us a bill over $100. Avoid this place. Just say no.]
