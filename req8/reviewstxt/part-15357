[102978915328458793221,100985025202803673415,Wow! I did not know it was supposed to be like this. I was involved in a collision in Rockville with my Lexus GS350. My insurance company Allstate, referred to me their preferred shop. Well I've been around the block one too many times to fall for that trick. My last accident I took it to Allstate' preferred shop and I left with self esteem issues and a car with two shades of white that kept falling apart. I called them to complain but soon realized it was the insurance company they wanted to keep happy, and not me. Well this time I googled body shop in Rockville and found a number of listings. Then I read reviews, called a few, and went in to Total Recon because I read their stellar reviews on Yelp and could not believe the consistency in amazing customers. I spoke with Bobby and found him professional, knowledgeable yet very down to earth. He explained to me how they are an independent shop and work for the customer and not the insurance company. I just got a good sense and left my car there and enterprise came and picked me up. Bobby called me the next day and said Allstate's estimate was too low and called for cheap aftermarket parts. He said he would make Allstate pay for original Lexus parts and pay for proper repair procedures. True to his word I got my car back a week later (3 days earlier than promised) looking like new...better then new. They even detailed the car from top to the bottom which I was not expecting. If your involved in an accident, take your car to Total Recon in Rockville but definitely not where your insurance company tells you. Best body shop in Rockville.]
