[106207882688102058154,100163071009963066794,I am a seasoned vapor users, so know what I'm talking about. The unit I was sold is faulty; 2 days after I purchased it, I tried to exchange it but was told it must be my tank. I continue to have issues with it. My friend with me purchased her first unit. She said she only used menthol flavor and was sold a plastic tank. The menthol eats the tank and when she tried to return it, she was told that she shouldn't have gotten a plastic tank, which THEY recommended. She had to purchase another tank and was not offered any recompense. I am unhappy with the store and will not go there again.]
