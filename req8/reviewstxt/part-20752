[101011082847932112349,100099469628419677817,Clarissa is so sweet and down to earth. She puts so much thought and time into her work, and really enjoys what she does. Having a photographer who loves what he or she does really makes a difference... Clarissa showed up to our session with great ideas and was able to bring out our personalities without making our photos look phony. My fianc√© is super camera shy- he freezes and tenses up in front of cameras. Clarissa was able to bring out his natural "modeling" abilities! :) We cannot thank Vantage Media enough for our beautiful engagement photos!]
