[107142167645709443233,100321931004393644416,Worst company! Worst store manager Dominic. Took my machine in for the same problem 2 times in 2 months and they keep telling me it's my fault. Finally is broke on them during there test drive (times now same issue). Now they are thinking it is something else. Not willing to make it right either. Beware! None of the other Ridenow's are any better.]
