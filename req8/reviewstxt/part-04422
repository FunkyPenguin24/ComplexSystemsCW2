[101658662553032180670,100393764424366580185,This is typically my first stop when I'm looking for an old book. They usually have what I'm looking for and they have an inventory of what they have so I don't have to spend a lot of time looking for it if I am in a rush. The staff have always greeted me as I come in to buy or even to browse the shelves and it is very hard to leave without buying something. There are so many books I always find something I want to read. I saw another review where they were complaining about the prices, but if you take into account shipping it evens out, and I would rather give my money to a small business than a company over the Internet.]
