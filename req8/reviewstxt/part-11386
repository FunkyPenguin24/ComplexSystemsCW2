[105744490253967904562,100768297419072911649,I have listened to other podcasts about SEO that promise a lot and deliver nothing. I listen to Chris and Charles every time I am in the Ute driving from Sydney to Canberra (worlds most boring drive made easier), best news is I can now hear it without having to sit beside the speaker. I have zero SEO experience, however like most things with a small start up I cannot afford to pay other people just yet to improve my ranking. The great news is that I have improved my Google organic impressions by 11% and my organic clicks are up 9% this month. I haven't even had time to carry out 10% of the tips that I have learned through listening to E-Webstyle! Thanks for the podcast it has helped keep me on track towards my online vision.]
