[111737014199343190596,100778378530695609666,This store is beautiful. I love supporting local stores, but I cannot go back as this is the third time I have received bad service. The sales associate was very rude and I would highly recommend finding someone else to work the floor if you hope to keep customers returning. You can find the same prices and items on Amazon and other baby stores, wish I could keep coming here for my cloth diapers but third time's the charm for me. Seeya!]
