[106704088623370725547,101101245992343916472,*THIS IS NOT THE BLACKJACK POCKET CLUB, THIS IS A PRIVATE HUNTING AND FISHING CLUB* Two toilets in one room with no partition walls... JUST TO START! Not to mention the draft, exposed particle board 'interior wall covering' and the fact that there are 20 twin sized beds in one large room with not a single queen or king in sight! The chorus of snores that cranks up around 8:00 is almost deafening and if you're not ahead of that crowd you can count yourself OUT of getting a good night's rest. The only redemptive factor of this place is the hunting/fishing and the bucket. I would not recommend this location to a friend.]
