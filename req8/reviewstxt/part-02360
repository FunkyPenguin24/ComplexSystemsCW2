[100430243401213135080,100280321208098173319,Horrible service. It took 10 minutes for someone to come to our table. An hour to get our food, and still my husband got his food, finished, and I didn't get mine. My food was disgusting. Some parts were burnt and the eggs were badly cooked . There was so much mayonnaise on his egg sandwich that the bread was moist, and just no attentiveness by the waitress.]
