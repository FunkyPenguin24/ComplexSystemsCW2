[106672335139872833683,100213398046843873351,I've been a member for over a year now. Comments about the bathrooms are pretty accurate. Since I primarily swim don't know as much about the equipment. I'd say pool and suit spinner are poorly managed. Often they let kids play in the pool when people are trying to swim laps and they have no swimsuit water extractor. I usually use the facility located in Pearland instead of this one.]
