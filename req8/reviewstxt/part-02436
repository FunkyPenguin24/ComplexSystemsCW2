[111254282667864812597,100284630090407183976,I could not be happier with the people and the facilities. I have a 1 year old 40 pound dog with a history of abuse. She is terrified of new places and new people, but within a few minutes she was wagging her tail and having a good time. The receptionists, the techs, and Dr Leibovitz were all so kind and loving. They worked with her anxiety and once she calmed down, they took care of her with no problem and gave me all kinds of pointers on raising her. I'm so happy that we found a good place that we can trust.]
