[107229514669901628386,100983609687709545556,I have been coming to Taco Loco for a little over two years. Their food is wonderful! They have a great salsa bar. They have a good selection and their prices are very decent. The serving sizes are very large, I normally can get both lunch and dinner from one dish. The atmosphere is very authentic to the Spanish culture. The service can be a little lax and not overly friendly but overall this place is worth eating at.]
