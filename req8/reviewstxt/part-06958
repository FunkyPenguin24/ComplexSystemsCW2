[113365871004528034357,100530936615091208935,I went through the drive through and asked what kind of sauce was on the Doubliicious sandwich and the lady said it is "secret sauce." I asked her to describe it please and she said "I can't, I don't eat it!" I asked if it was like another sauce? "I don't know!" She said. Ok, so I know I am not going to get anywhere and ask for it to be on the side, and then ask if she can add pickles to it. She said "No." Really!!! I asked again and said seriously you can not add pickles to the sandwich? The sandwich pictured on the menu right below it had pickles on it. I could not believe she said no! I was about to drive off and she came back and said in a rude voice "Never mind we can add them." At the window she told me she could not put the sauce on the side! Then I find out she charged me $.22 for pickles!!! Really!! Who does that? Worst service ever and this is not the first time having bad service at the KFC, although it is the worst. I will not go back to this dump, and it is a dump as the previous reviewers mentioned.]
