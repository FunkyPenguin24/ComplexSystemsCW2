[114573226313106702102,101112461155852693435,I have used Braintree Rehab on different occasions, and I have been more then happy with the treatment I have received here. They don't just treat the problem they treat the surrounding problems that stem from it as well. I have never had that at any other PT I have ever been to, Example: I suffered a lower back injury. they didn't just treat the lower back, they treated the stomach sides and thighs as well since they all connect to make the back stronger. I love these ladies. They are worth their weight in gold.]
