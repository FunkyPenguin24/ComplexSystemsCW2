[101593537521060176112,100418632128446255334,Purchased a bike from Roy two months ago--really excellent customer service before and after the sale. Had a minor issue with an inner tube valve broken in shipping and he sorted it out immediately. It's a great bike at an awesome price, highly recommended to anyone considering a fixie or single-gear bike.]
