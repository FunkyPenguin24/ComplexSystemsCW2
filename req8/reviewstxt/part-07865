[115420234148012732469,100580431722242295347,We hosted a pre-wedding reception dinner for roughly 30 guests at Kate's Pizza Amore, and were extremely happy with the result. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, the bill was reasonable and the atmosphere was great. And the food was excellent - I'd eaten here before, so I know it was consistent, but every one of our guests I talked to was also pleased with their meal. An excellent place overall.]
