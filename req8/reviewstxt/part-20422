[111667748911384071812,100081971031179356876,I have been charged 3 times in the past 3 months after I cancelled my membership (back in June) due to a relocation. I called ABC (the company that bills you automatically every month) - it turns out I had a membership renewed under a different name. My name was spelled K-U-T-H-E-N-R-I-T-E-R. Who spells their name wrong? Not me. [EDIT (11/13/2013): The owner resolved my dispute by sending me a check for two months payment - I paid my $50 fee. Basically, I was right; they were wrong. That should have closed the deal. Instead, I have been charged another month's dues (2 months after submitting cancellation paperwork). Very Annoyed...] I am being charged 3 months of dues AND the $50 relocation cancellation fee because it appears someone punched my name in wrong when my account was renewed. The facilities are clean. Services are acceptable. Equipment is nice and respected by members. Very poor business practices, IMO. I'll pay these fees, but I'm not sure I will accept doing so.]
