[101958658423666860236,100182411214592613567,Chris and his team replaced old and worn out iron roofs for my buildings at Epsom. He did a meticulous job, which went beyond the call of duty. His team were always helpful, tidy and professional and most of all, cleaned up the site after they finished. Chris has as organized team and one has only to trust him with the job and you will always be delighted. He is now our friend and I recommend Tyson Roofing very strongly for your roofing work. If you would like to see his work, visit the 2 buildings at Caring 4 Smiles Dental Group, 475 Manukau Road, Epsom. All the best Chris. Thanks for a great job.]
