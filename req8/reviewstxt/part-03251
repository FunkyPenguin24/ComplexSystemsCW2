[101966532345922298464,100326722460244574137,Excellent service, people and dentistry. I feel my teeth were "really" cleaned for the first time in a long time, even though I had just had a cleaning a year prior. And, I had been to another dentist for a dental "procedure" plan just a month ago, this Dr. at Kool Smiles, found a problem with a front tooth that nobody else had found before. Wow! All I can say, "great place for the whole family"]
