[106851852937270483362,100026777043835595529,Purchasing my car was a great experience. Service is beyond HORRIBLE! No car rentals, cannot schedule service or have limited window to do so. Expect customers to wait for 3+ hours while they fix your car because they do not want give loaners - those who can afford your so called premium brand can do so because we WORK! All the more reason to offer loaners. Tried to schedule my service & recall repairs AGAIN today, canceled last time because they would not loan me a car and the service rep yelled at me and hung up on me because I said I did not have time in my schedule to wait for 3 hours while they repaired my recall. A recall is your fault D-bag, not mine and my time should not be impacted. Had to fight to get a loaner car. Was told to bring in at 6:30PM, got stuck in a meeting, called to see if I can bring in 7AM tomorrow AM - was told no because they are booked solid. You would think that an $80,000 car would get you customer service. Guess I did not spend enough. SO OVER IRVINE BMW. GOING TO TRY A DIFFERENT BMW DEALER, I HEAR IRVINE BMW HAS HAD SERVICE ISSUES FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE IN ORANGE COUNTY.]
