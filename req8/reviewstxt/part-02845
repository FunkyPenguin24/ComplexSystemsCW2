[105483427421840078279,100305472047811926988,As a fellow colleague of Dr. Bernstein I can say without a doubt he is one of the most fired up and passionate orthodontists I have ever met. He loves what he does and will not settle for mediocrity. This translates into a perpetual desire to excel and provide nothing but excellence for himself and his patients. Keep up the great work Dr. Bernstein, you are an inspiration to us all! Best, Dr Eric Wu]
