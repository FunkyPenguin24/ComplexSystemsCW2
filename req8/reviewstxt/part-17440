[104217499072844211456,101100195190727875920,It's typical. The day before Thanksgiving a deep clog somewhere in my home's pipes caused my washing machine to empty it watery contents directly into my downstairs bathroom's shower, and subsequently onto my bathroom floor! The ensuing flood made my bathroom unusable and I was left with the daunting task of finding a plumber who could come out on short notice to tackle the problem at hand. Thank god for Terry. He returned my call quickly, and came by early on Thanksgiving morning to deal with the problem. He was friendly, knowledgeable, and charged me a very reasonable rate. I'll be keeping his number handy for any future issues! Highly recommended!]
