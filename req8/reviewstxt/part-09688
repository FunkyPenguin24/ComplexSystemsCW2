[103188790134193649868,100676221817090893480,I have been storing my belongings there for two years now. I feel that for the size and the items being stored the price is very reasonable. On top of that the insurance is very reasonable. It is very easy to access and paying the bill on-line is great, because then I don't even have to go to the storage unit to pay it. All my belonging have been fairing quite well and I overall have no complaints! I would definitely recommend it to all!]
