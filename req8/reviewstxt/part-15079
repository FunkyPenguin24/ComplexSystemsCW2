[109218889217332440679,100970629894662384703,Love this place. No one can beat the quality at Lumber Baron. Redwood is supposed to be Red, not yellow. The owner, Max, had some beautiful reclaimed redwood I used for stain grade casement windows. The grain was straight and tight. My favorite aspect of the Lumber Baron, no cumbersome orange carts. You can park your truck right at the wood you need and load-up! No barcode hunting games or clowns on forklifts parading around. Im in and out in 10 mins every time.]
