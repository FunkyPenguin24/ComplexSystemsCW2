[105158213566900329567,101000751618892450632,GDW has been a favorite since I moved to Carson City 3 years ago. Really great hotel front desk staff.. If you're going to pull an all nighter this is the place to do it! GET A ROOM and now you don't have to drive home or to your hotel, since most Carson City casinos don't have an integrated hotel like GDW..]
