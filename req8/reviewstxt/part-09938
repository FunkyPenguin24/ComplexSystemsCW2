[107626627438791286138,100689861683962909277,This dealership is first-class. Everyone was helpful and friendly and the amenities are wonderful. Cafe, Club Lexus (spa, etc) I love that I can get something done while waiting for my car instead of just sitting around (nails, massage,hair, media center...). My sales associate was David Kafka who was incredible. Friendly, professional, knowledgeable. No sales BS at all. I think out of all the sales associates that I've dealt with over many years, David is by far the best.]
