[116740017797998493262,100057320026328076597,There are sales and then there are sales experiences. If you are looking for just another transaction then go to Craig's List, Ebay or any one of a number of dealerships. If you are looking to both purchase a bike, understand all its capabilities and feel very confident in your selection when you ride away from the dealership - then please go see my man Kelly at Harley-Davidson of Tampa, FL on Dale Mabry Highway. Being a bike novice Kelly walked me through every feature offered on a score of different bikes (not just Harley-Davidsons). He took a great deal of time to make sure I was comfortable in selecting the exact bike that was both best for me and for the exact product I was shopping for. I just haven't seen this kind of service at other dealerships (both cars and bikes). I really believe Kelly might have passed up other sales opportunities to educate me on my potential purchase. Being obsessed with mechanical details was not a problem at this dealership. Kelly walked me back into the garage area of the dealership so that I could see everything about the engine and power transfer systems of the particular model bike that I was interested in (the "Fat Bob"). I asked all my questions and they were answered completely and professionally. I cannot say enough about the sales experience of this dealership. If you are looking for a bike or just have general questions about motorcycle ownership, please go talk to the good folks at Tampa Harley-Davidson and specifically ask for Kelly.]
