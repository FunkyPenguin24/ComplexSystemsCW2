[109582310921465946509,100179775107237001458,I ordered a ribeye and received a hunk of tough meat laced with way to much fat. I had to chase down the waitress more than once, for a drink and my check. Frankly, I shouldn't have paid over $20 for food I couldn't eat and service I had to chase down. I would NOT recommend this place "until" proper training of staff is provided and they focus on food quality and customer service.]
