[117077465855882985239,100529384905655809117,I stayed at the Bayhouse Hostel Penghu for a few days in late December 2012. I felt very much at home and taken care of from start to finish, starting with Damon picking me up from the airport and telling me how to use the eco-friendly scooter. Due to such services, the distance to the center does not matter at all and in fact the location lends itself to more out-of-the-way adventures than simply living in the city centre. I will definitely go back one day.]
