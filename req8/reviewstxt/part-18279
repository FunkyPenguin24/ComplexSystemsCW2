[108638195992874922191,101144277127549928651,This is authentic South Indian food and some of the dishes can be really spicy if not ordered carefully. Masala dosa is very good here. The sambar is as spicy and tasty as it should be. I was a regular customer to this place until I ordered a a 4 dosa plate. The owners gave me a ridiculously small proportion of sambar to go with it although I asked for more at the start. In the end he blind sided me by notifying that extra sambar would cost me extra. At that point I was in no position to argue because I did not have anything eat the dosa with. So, beware of the cheap mentality of the people running this place. This is only a small start up and they have not yet got their policies right. The place is only large enough to fit around 10 people.]
