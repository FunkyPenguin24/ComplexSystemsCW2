[113111188881261006444,100845789718066987720,I went to Woodbury Dental after I decided to look for a new dental clinic. The entire operation from the moment I walked in the door until the time I left was ultra positive. I had three kids with, who loved the lobby play place so much that they didn't want to leave. The technician was very easy to talk to, and did a great job with my cleaning. The entire office is very clean and comfortable, as well as technologically advanced. All the staff was very personable. We will definitely be back!!]
