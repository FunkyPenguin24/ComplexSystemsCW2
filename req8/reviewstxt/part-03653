[105893526791784552433,100349556496195841083,I'm a bass guitar player and have been playing for almost ten years now. I brought my bass into the shop at Taylor's and got a set up done with Elixir strings. Which is different because I have always played on DR strings in the past, but I must say these Elixirs have me sold with there smooth feel and exceptional life span. The set up was done perfectly and made playing much easier with the appropriate action and intonation.The pricing was very fair and they got it done in a very timely manor. I will definitely come back here to get all of my basses set up and any repair work that I will ever need in the future.]
