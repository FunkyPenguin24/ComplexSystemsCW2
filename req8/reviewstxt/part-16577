[105451088918389471327,101051751655667457275,I thought I was a loyal customer of Momo since I kept coming back and bringing my friends over. But my mind is changed from last experience at Momo. I had dinner with three friends and stayed to talk a bit after dinner. Just before we were leaving (a friend went to restroom), the manager came over and asked us to leave (politely) and told us he has another reservation. It wasn't a big deal. If the manager didn't come, we would have left in 1 minute any way. It was true that it made me feel a bit uncomfortable when I saw there were another 5 free tables (same size) and no other customers waiting. I talked to the manager that I felt a bit uncomfortable. The manager said that they give each table around 1h30mins. I looked at my watch and we stayed for 1h39mins. We had to leave basically it's not because of another reservation but 9 mins over his "rule". The experience made me to think a loyal customer doesn't mean much to Momo and it is more important that their rigid "rule" can be carried out. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to my friends. If you would go, don't forget to set up an alarm before you sit down.]
