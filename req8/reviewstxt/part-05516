[105006630732987072355,100451893364491437732,$40 for access to such equipment is absolutely awesome. And classes are offered in the evenings, weekend and lunch time for those who like a group thing. Locker room area (for guys) is pretty clean, but the bathroom stalls are gross and really need to be replaced. Showers look fine, but I don't really use them. They have a racquetball court, fitness studio (with sparingly offered yoga) and boxing classes, so variety is great here.]
