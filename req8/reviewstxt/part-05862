[112680105840572271770,100469918698442866501,Took my 1997 Mastercraft Wakeboard boat there for some well need love. The sound system, interior and exterior were shot. They gave me a tour of their portfolio and HUGE shop and I was sold. The expert crew gave me many ideas and suggestions and allowed me to work with them through the whole upgrade process. We ended up completely vinyl wrapping the exterior of the boat, reupholstering the interior, replacing the carpet and sound system. They turned a boat that was weathered, old and tired into a work of art and I’m STOKED! I’ve had 10 people ask me when I got my new boat, it looks that good. Do yourself a favor and check this place.]
