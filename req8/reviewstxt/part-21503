[105070324490107781104,100140034502855384159,If you need a cup of coffee for a great price, Red House is the way to go. Although its not the best coffee in Weaverville, it is great for the price. If you go between 4 and 5 everything is half off, making a warm (or cold) coffee on the patio a vacation for the taste buds and the wallet. If your looking for great baristas and amazing coffee, and willing to spend the extra cash, Strawhouse or Mama Llama's is the way to go, but if your looking for a step up from Starbucks but with a much greater atmosphere and price, come by Red House!]
