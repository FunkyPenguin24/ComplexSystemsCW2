[100825595338501378064,101132483413518636611,Asaka's used to be a good place to go for a quick bite but over the years has spiraled down into crap. The final straw was this past weekend, my friends and i went and about five minutes into being in the resturant saw little bugs on the wall and a big fat RAT run out from under our table and INTO THE MAIN DINING ROOM. Will NEVER be back and have warned many people NOT to go there.]
