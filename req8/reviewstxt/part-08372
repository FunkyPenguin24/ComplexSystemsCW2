[114122945311330296320,100607365850481217178,Taqueria Mexico is, by far, the best mexican restaurant I have ever been to (that's out of atleast five states). The food is well priced, authentic, and DELICIOUS. The restaurant serves three different types of salsa with every meal (all delicious and made in-house). The servers are friendly and can customize/ add-on to meals easily. My husband and I have been eating here on a monthly (more often, weekly) basis for the past 3 years, and we have never (seriously, never) been disappointed. 2 thumbs up, 5 stars, 10/10 whatevers. Hungry for Mexican, GO HERE!]
