[113717956733824838304,100382897004243922444,We've seen Doc Durr regularly for about 6 months and really love his services. He has fair prices, is very friendly and applies his knowledge to provide the best care possible. He is really good to communicate changes to our condition and always offers advice improving our condition on our own. Our 2 year-old sees him also and she accepts his care with ease. His office is small but very accommodating with plenty equipment to provide an array of services. We really love seeing Doctor Carson!]
