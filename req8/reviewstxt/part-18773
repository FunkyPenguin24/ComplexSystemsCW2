[113958332096612487879,101170729478625282828,The customer service at Extra Space Storage on U St in DC was GREAT! The facility was clean. I was there on behalf of my company. Since it was my first time there I asked Edmund if he could walk me to the unit then to the shred truck that I had to meet. On our way there I know I talked Edmond's ear off but he didn't seem to mind at all. LoL He was professional, polite, and very helpful. Thank you for your GREAT customer service Edmund! I recommend this place to everyone.]
