It normally has a great selection of movies to choose from. The food is expensive. Like, *really* expensive. But, that's what you get for cheap tickets I suppose. Often, the place smells of bad breath and dirty bathrooms, but with a hint of.. mint? It's like they try to cover the odor with not enough good odor. I think it makes it even worse. The crowds aren't always nice, but I suppose that's not the theatre's fault.]
