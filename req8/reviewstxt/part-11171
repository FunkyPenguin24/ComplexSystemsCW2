I run a small IT company in a competitive market, and their suggestions have done more for my rankings than any of the paid Internet marketers. We also do web-design and the pointers allow us to provide some SEO-lite support to small businesses that cannot afford a full blown SEO company and at the very least we can set up their sites the right way so that in the future they can engage with an SEO without having to do a rewrite. Keep up the Great work, PITF to both of you.]
