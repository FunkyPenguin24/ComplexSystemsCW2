[102918341023048685908,100061332957339572824,Went for dinner and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the dishes. Good-sized portions and simple receipes done well. Not a wide enough beer selection but there are a few local craft beers on tap. Service was ok but the environment was great. Would definitely check this place out again.]
