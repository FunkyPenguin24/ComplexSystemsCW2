[105345912506019932222,100184058951004398522,Doug is a sandwich master. While the soft serve is great, I go to the Freez when I'm in the mood for massive amounts of meat and toppings in a sandwich for less than $5. Understated, this place is a gem. Easily the sickest Freez/Sandwich shop in the universe, let alone the Happy Valley.]
