[105463197237533964988,100714406903730861649,Scheduled an appointment for Saturday with the lady on the phone stating that if I am late or had to cancel, the $50 deposit would not be refunded. I stated I have/had a $150 gift certificate. They stated I had to use this only on select dates. I chose 3/1/2014 which is a Saturday and then they penciled me in for that date. Fair enough, except when I drove 30 miles to go there, nobody was at the office. Several other customers were there too at the front door with me and nobody was there. The door was locked and everything. Called the office and left a message (as well as the other girl) and I never got a response. The office next door called the doctor and he stated they didn't know about any bookings today. They didn't seem real concern whatsoever about calling to say sorry or anything. Apparently people/customers come second here. I felt a type of feeling of "Pay and get out" attitude with all of this. I wouldn't get work there if it was free with that type of attitude especially if customers are treated with this lack of respect. By the way, this is the second time my appointment was made and cancelled (in this case a no-show).]
