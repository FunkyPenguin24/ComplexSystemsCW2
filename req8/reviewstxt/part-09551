[115557698970530269044,100669032593741512094,I absolutely love this place. Reasonably priced, clean, excellent customer service and very capable manicurists and masseuses. I have gone there for Gelish manicures multiple times and for whatever reason they last longer than other ones I've had. The atmosphere is wonderful and parking is really easy. I highly recommend this place.]
