[103433506471522948570,100926150302212378618,I have been involved with the Laguna Beach Animal Hospital for over 20 years and through 3 Irish Setters. Wouldn't consider going elsewhere. In addition to the clear extensive capability and knowledge, Dr. Levin and the staff exhibit professionalism and compassion, fully understanding how important our pets are to us. Glad to be able to take the opportunity to share my respect for them.]
