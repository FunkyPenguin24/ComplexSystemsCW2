[102774289274950568617,100023207054608335152,We came in just to look for a car and ended up walking out with a Mercendes Benz C300. The facility itself was very open and clean. As soon as we sat down, we were welcomed by staff that walked by us. Your really do not get this much attention with many dealerships. Our salesman Sammy really walked us through each step, answering any questions and concerns we had on the way. He had pride in being apart of the Mercedes Benz family and knew so much about each vehicle. This was beneficial to us because we were able to find the car to suit all of our needs very quickly. He even knew more than my husband that has dealt with cars all his life. Once we found the car him and his manager Tim were able to really work with us with pricing. Sammy then took his time with my husband teaching him all about the car and its features. We were out with our new car by the next day ( because we had insure the vehicle). They went above and beyond our expectations, my husband and I are very happy to be apart of the Mercedes Benz Family. If you are looking for a top of the line luxury vehicle, look no further! God Bless.]
