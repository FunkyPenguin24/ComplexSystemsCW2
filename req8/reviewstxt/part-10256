[105373562786479804416,100707905188792477398,I am thrilled with the level of service and professionalism at The Temple. From the moment I called to set up my appointment to the second I walked out the door, I felt as if I was in a high-end salon! Very friendly staff, helpful, and professional! I have been to many places over the years (all over the world), and I rate my haircut, color and highlights in the top 10 of services I have received in the past! I will be going back to The Temple, and I would recommend it to anyone looking to have their hair done in Frederick, MD!]
