[103437344335351844124,100375121265379685922,There's always something new when I visit Feather Touch these days. First it was the expansion of the practice with the addition of Dr. Neal Shah, then the amazing remodeling of the facilities and space. All for the good, I might add. You are warmly greeted by smiling staff. The attention paid to my teeth by Dr. Ross is what's kept them in my mouth for the past 40 years! And that's why I'll keep coming back.]
