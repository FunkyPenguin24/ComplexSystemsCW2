[112134343766698495186,100100194122912404066,This restaurant was fantastic! The wait staff was attentive, nice and helpful in describing the beers and food........and the food was phenomenal! We had a pineapple special with pork, chicken, steak, onions and cheese, and it was crazy good! That along with a combination dinner, and we were so stuffed we rolled across the street to our hotel! Highly recommend this restaurant. :) Very reasonable and easy going atmosphere.]
