[102784550701840728047,100321774509364506739,The experiance was great. My buddy reccomended me to the dealership because they don't play games. I hate going into a dealership and having to play a game of poker. I told them what I could do and they made it happen, easy as that. The staff was great and didn't pressure us at all. If nothing else just go in and say hello to Betty Jo!! She is quite a character and makes you feel right at home. Thanks M'Lady Nissan!!!]
