[104970929280853397559,100936873239981722752,The veterinary eye doctor did a wonderful job. I couldn't have been more impressed. It helped too that a good deal came off the price of the surgery. We did an initial test, called an ERG, which the veterinary eye specialist does to be sure our dog is able to get vision back -- the eye doctor doesn't want to waste our money. After the surgery was done, we were delighted to find the entire testing amount was removed from the cost of the cataract surgery, which was performed in both eyes. We also got a month of free rechecks. We were back the day after surgery -- procedure here to double check -- the dog ophthalmologist is very thorough. Mille is seeing beautifully! What a gift this veterinary ophthalmologist is. I would not ever know Mille had any eye issues before.]
