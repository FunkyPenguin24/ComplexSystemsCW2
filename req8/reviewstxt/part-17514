The management is difficult to say the least. The maintenance is poor. My apartment has flooded at least 6 times in the past couple of months and management basically just tells us, "oh well, it sure has rained a lot lately, huh". However, my bathroom has had water pour down from the ceiling almost as many times as the living room as flooded. I also have mold in the walls now and the air conditioner floods occasionally as well! Who needs the community pool? Thankfully I haven't been robbed, but my door shows obvious signs of a past break-in and I've been informed of at least 3 robberies while I've lived here. I, too, regret renewing here. Oh and don't forget to read the fine print on your letters from mgmt and in your lease. You'll regret it if you don't.]
