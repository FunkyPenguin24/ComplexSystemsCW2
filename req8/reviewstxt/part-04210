[109405963855281741819,100382459710536355242,Just visited Buddy's and I must say I understand why the waitress was complaining about it being so slow to a bar patron. You would think we would get great service being the only customers in there to eat. Instead we got to hear her complain to the cook about not letting her know the food had been up and having to ask for a refill.. Food was not what I would expect for the price. Tasted like old fries reheated in the fryer. The flounder and shrimp was average at best. None of us felt good about the experience. I guess they can keep wondering why it is so slow. We will not be back.]
