[101662797940467551279,100099315911733553852,My favorite sushi place of all time. The owners are so sweet and the food is incredible specially the sushi it's always made fresh and large portions unlike other sushi places that gives you small baby sushi. Yes sometimes it takes time to get your food but that's because they slammed with orders and try to do their best.]
