[104527477334398687899,100228554177809722430,This McDonalds is horrible!!!!! It was close for several months and just recently reopened. You would think it would be better than before right? WRONG! They have 2 lanes in the drive thru that converge into one. I said it the first time I saw they were doing this...orders are going to get screwed up....and guess what happens....THEY GOT SCREWED UP!!! I get up to the window to get my food, they ask me what my order was not telling me why....then ask me to pull up and wait by the door, the girl comes out and tells me...we accidentally gave out your order to someone else. So not only did my order get screwed up, someone else got the wrong order. It's complete and utter chaos. Plus the people working the drive thru are just standing around doing nothing, playing with the slide door and such. Having worked in a restaurant business before myself, I know that this would be a problem and sure enough it caused peoples orders to get screwed up and I strongly suggest you don't go through the drive thru at this Mc Donalds]
