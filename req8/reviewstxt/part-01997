[112686646926389561154,100262458481554803673,Avoid this place at all costs! The owner is an absolute thief! We purchased a refrigerator that ended up NEVER being delivered. When I tried to get a refund I was quickly informed that I would not receive any money until they sold the refrigerator to someone else. I thought to myself, "thank God I paid with AMEX, I'll just dispute it". Well that wasn't the end of it. This crooked business owner provided fraudulent documents to American Express showing that I signed for delivery. He is currently being investigated for FRAUD. Avoid this disaster of a business and take your hard earned money elsewhere! Can't believe this place stays in business.]
