[109231947032423703856,100537929322770251102,I must've been to more than hundred hostels all around the world, but i must say - I absolutely LOVED staying in Pacific Tradewinds Backpacker Hostel. I stayed there for 10 day, and i think It's the best hostel in San Francisco! The place was really clean and comfortable, the location was great, close to BART, MUNI, and to buses and trams, but what's more important - the staff there is quite amazing! Everyone is really friendly and goes out of their way to make sure you have a great time in San Francisco. They have special discounts for tours, bikes, etc, and will suggest you where and how to spend a day; they'll pretty much share with you all they know about SF. Also, their central "hanging-out" space is really cosy and friendly. If you are traveling by yourself and don't know many people in SF, definitely stay in this hostel, and you'll make a lot of new friends and have a good time! :) Last but not least, they have a free WiFi there, and even two desktops where you can check your email.]
