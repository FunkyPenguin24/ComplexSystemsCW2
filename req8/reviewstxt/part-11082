[109839428131005759338,100752168106318478806,After receiving a frantic call from my wife regarding a chipmunk in our house. I called Pioneer after 5pm hoping that I wouldn't get a recording. The office manager was very helpful and re-assuring. After taking my information, she told me that someone would contact me soon. Within minutes I received a call from Tom, one of the owners. He came right out loaded with Live Traps. Not only was he an expert at setting and strategically placing the traps, he was able to calm down my wife and two small children. Within an hour the chipmunk was caught and released into a nearby park. Pioneer is now my go-to company for not only rodent removal, but pest control as well.]
