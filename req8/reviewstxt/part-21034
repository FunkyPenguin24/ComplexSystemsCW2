[102009957203800723230,100114274993859491809,I purchased a 2012 Jeep Patriot Saturady and I coudl not have been more pleased with the process. Velko was a great salesman and I would and will reccomend him to everyone I know. He was patient, knowledgeable, had a great personality, all around great guy and easy to talk about my needs with. He clearly wanted to make sure I purchasing something I was happy with. I am looking forward to a long car relationship with him and the dealership. Bob was also great to talk to during the process for the cars protection plan and again no hard sell, Brandon made finance like getting a ice cream cone. It was quick, fast, easy, everything was explained. It was after hours but he did not seem to be phased by that. It was a shear pleasure doing business with these men and the dealership. As I waiting to go see Brandon other reps where conversing and we talked cars, weather, many issues. I just can not say enough. It was a great way to spend my Saturday afternoon.]
