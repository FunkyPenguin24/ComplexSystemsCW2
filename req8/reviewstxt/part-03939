[115992622409812038816,100365987522347789248,My wife and I were staying in Southampton following a week long holiday in Manhattan (We're from Northern Ireland). We stopped off at this aquarium on one of our days touring the North Fork and I'm very glad we did. My wife, who normally hates being dragged to museums etc., thoroughly enjoyed the experience. We spent around 2 hours exploring the various exhibits, learning from the employees and simply relaxing. Well worth a visit if you're in the area. I can only imagine the negative reviews are from people who a) expected too much or b) don't have any particular interest in sea life or animals.]
