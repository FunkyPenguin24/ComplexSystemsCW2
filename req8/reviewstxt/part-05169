[110347441905086111928,100432923844189498741,Elias did NOT close their doors until November 8th 2013. EVERY client that Elias could NOT complete a short sale for due to the Freddie Mac issues, were offered to go to a different agent with a full team of negotiators so that the Elias name could NOT hurt them.Not ONE time did I hear Will or any of his other employees tell the client sorry we can't do your short sale peace out. Yes they were hard to get ahold of sometimes but that is because they were busy on the phones processing the short sales. EVERY client was able to call the front desk and speak to a person. Don't believe everything you read.]
