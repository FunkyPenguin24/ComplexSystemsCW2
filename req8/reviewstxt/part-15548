[105889792745360865807,100996795881509321308,We had a problem with our kitchen outlets not working even after resetting. We called Thomas and described the problem. He knew exactly what the problem was AND he was able to come to our home that day! After researching, he found an additional problem and corrected it as well. Our home was built in 1996 so the wiring did not have the same regulations as today. We have not had any problems since. We will definitely call Classic Electric with any electrical issues from now on.]
