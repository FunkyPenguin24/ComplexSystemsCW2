[102187242526421885675,100997823648701031085,After working with many other dealers, I found Country Nissan to be the best! It started out with Rose, who emailed me with all the information I needed to make a good decision on which vehicle and how much I would pay for it. The entire staff at Country Nissan has been excellent, from the start through and including the Service staff. I live over 60 miles away and will continue to go back for service and will recommend this dealership to everyone.]
