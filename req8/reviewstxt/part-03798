[105027626024373301390,100358650130767417367,First time eating here. Food was fantastic. Husband had ribeye steak. I had chicken alfredo. Both meals were fantastic. Our waitress was great. The restaurant is in a older building but the decor is bright ,happy,and clean. We didnt get to try their desserts because we were stuffed. So pleased with the low prices for the amount of food we got. We will definantly be back.]
