[110692204167820156985,100772099668144749726,I always have a good experience at the aquarium! I take my little sister, and she loves it. There's fun stuff for kids to do and she always learns a lot. For her birthday, my parents got her and I tickets to actually snorkel in the tank with the whale sharks (and hammerheads I might add). It was one of the coolest things I've every done-the swim right beneath you! The only down side is the price of tickets and food and merchandise when you're inside. If you can get past that, it's awesome!]
