[106888175426322937957,100527578181278876377,I absolutely loved my stay at Kingsgate. I can't get over how friendly the staff was- like everyone (the front desk was so helpful, my shuttle driver told us about some awesome spots in the city, such fun bartenders!, and I had fun conversations with my housekeeper daily). I stayed for 9 days for my residency and the food and service was amazing at every event. Everything was always so clean, they have great food options, and a lovely outdoor area outback. Great workout facility too! (with passes to the UofCincy gyms as well) I highly recommend your stay here!]
