[101702393947013882441,100951836021157519694,The whole team is second to none, from the sale down to financing they out did anything I could have expected. No hidden agendas.I felt like the team here was honest and not deceitful like a few places we stopped in before we went to Maher. Chris Vaas was the sales associate I dealt with. I have an extremely busy schedule being a paramedic student, working full time, and being a single mother, Chris worked around my schedule to get me into a car that I wanted for the right price, right financing, not to mention the great warranty on the car. Everyone there was extremely polite and helpful. I am very happy with my new car. Thanks for a great experience , I never knew getting a new car could be so hassle free and enjoyable. We will be back when it's time for our next car.]
