[116905156854533498194,100401121908470241446,There are multiple levels of performance. To make sure I adequately describe my experience with Reigan. I'm not sure exceptional is enough. ARS is blessed to have Reigan as an employee. He is not only good at inter-personal relationships but is very good at what he does. I would be happy to have him into my home again should I ever need service from ARS again. Thank you for his service. Sincerely, Ross B Tilton]
