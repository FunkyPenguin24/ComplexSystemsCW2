[111882038620680590295,100056966050308703494,Our experience with Mike at Good Car Company was fantastic. We purchased 3 cars from Mike within the last 3 years due to having teenagers. He was polite, friendly, and did not pressure us whatsoever. We were able to take the cars to our mechanic for a quick look at the cars, and no potential problems existed. All of the cars have had minimal repairs (and I mean minimal). We have gone back to Mike because of these 3 purchases, and will continue to go. Hands down, best experience we've had and we've been purchasing cars for 20 years.]
