[103700732733323760723,101095823736161428039,Recently stayed two nights at the Resort for a golf tournament. Nice place overall, but some things to be worked on as well. The Ridge course exceeded my expectations, the Point course was great too, the rooms were fantastic and the d√©cor and furnishings quite comfortable. The bed was awesome and having a flat screen t.v., mini-kitchenette and separate bathroom from the middle common room with kitchen and full-sized fridge was a nice feature too. The blinds on the windows were great as well at keeping out light when you didn't want it. The food was not great and the service left a bit to be desired inside the Resort, but on the course the people were overall very nice and prompt with service delivery. I was disappointed with no store being available for hygiene products, groceries, snacks, etc. in the Resort and think it a big deficiency in the present set up. The pool and the hot tubs outside looked nice and appealing, but I didn't get the opportunity to use them. I would encourage extending the hours later - 10 p.m. is too early for a hot tub on a +30C night. Perhaps allow private bookings of the facilities later in the night - then a measure of security can also be maintained in the area. Liked the underground parking a lot and think the only thing that needs to be added is additional luggage trolleys at the underground entrance to the Resort. There were 4 trolleys in the front lobby for those who arrived at that door, but none available conveniently for those parking and going up to their rooms from underground. Overall I think the rating of 4.0 is pretty accurate. Work on some of the details and it won't take long to get to 5.0. I will stay again - it's worth hoping in that time some of the weak parts will be strengthened.]
