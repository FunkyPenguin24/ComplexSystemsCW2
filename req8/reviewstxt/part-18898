[109144411598193514680,100001230790127835735,We needed an RV for the weekend in Corvallis and just decided to try calling some RV shops. Sharon at Southside was really helpful. The trailer was perfect, very clean and totally up to snuff. They delivered it to the sure, set it up and picked it up again. It was a great weekend and very affordable.]
