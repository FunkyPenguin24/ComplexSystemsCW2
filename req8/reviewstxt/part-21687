I was so blown away by their candor and warmth that I called the following Monday to get a no-obligation quote. Unbeknownst to me, I had be over-paying on my car and home insurance by $1,000 a year! I couldn't believe it, since I had been quoted by another company so recently, but they really made sure I had all the discounts that I qualified for with brought my rate down so much lower. I also love that they are open on Saturdays because I am so busy during the week.]
