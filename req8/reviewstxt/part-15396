[114163373786724813206,100987674331812341738,I Bought a 2001 Volvo S60 from D&C back in July 2011, The buying experience was quick and easy, no issues whatsoever, My car I was buying I found on the internet and drove 350 miles to pick it up, the person I was in contact with wasn't even there when I bought it, so it made it kind of weird. I got there at the time I said I would be, and went to look at the car, it was very dirty and dusty didn't at all look like the car in the ad because it was so dirty, the inside was clean. I was in a hurry to get home for my daughters birthday so I didn't have them clean it for me. I bought the car and left and headed home. I was about 100 miles down the road and tried to roll down the window and it didn't work, then the air bag light came on.. I thought oh well its to late to do anything about it. I got home the car sat over night, we move it and ther was a puddle of oil under it, oh well I thought again its my fault. During the time of the Emails back and forth I informed them about how the 2001 s60's have a lot of issues, he told me they had all been fixed by now and it was a good car I took his word for it. We Took it in for an oil change and the filter housning was full of gunk, the tech had to air chisle it out!! At one point the steering wheel bolt came loose and the wheel almost came off. We Loved this car, we Just had to trade it in because the transmission started acting up, we put less then 6000k miles on it since the purchase. The dealership I just traded it at only gave us $1500 for it and I just paid $5500 a year ago. Now Im not saying all there cars are junk, but just make sure you check it out before you buy, that was a mistake on my part and I lost a lot of money because of this.. Would I buy from them again? Probably not...]
