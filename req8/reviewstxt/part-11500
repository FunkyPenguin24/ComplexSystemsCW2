[108438249164112729236,100773407104718418396,This would have been 1 star if not for the food/beverage staff. I have played Huntmore 8 or so times and yesterday (7/14/13) was such an unenjoyable experience I can't see myself going back. We were part of a group of 20 golfers and our first group was slow first and foremost. I dislike slow golf as much as anyone and my group played at a very tidy pace waiting to tee off on every hole but one. The rangers harrassed our first group for the majority of the round. Upon every visit, they then felt the need to come back to my group and tell us that he just told them to pick it up and we need to keep up. I stopped counting how many times this happened at 4, including while I was parked at the clubhouse at the turn while my girlfriend was using the rest room. Once again, I understand that we need to keep up and we did. I understand them coming back and telling us once that if they speed up we need to keep up. But when you tell me half a dozen times or more you are going to get some aggravated golfers. If you want them to play faster, give them some tips on how they can play more efficiently. Just hanging around and saying the same thing over and over again does no one any good. On a positive note, though, the rest of the staff from the guy in the pro shop to the girls on the carts were top notch. Course was in above average shape and the greens were nice and quick per usual. Having said that yesterday will be the last time I play Huntmore.]
