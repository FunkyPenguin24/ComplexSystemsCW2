[100485646559675742096,100167300039834785789,Came here for long weekend away from city. In NYC you come with certain expectations for $300 a night. The rooms were disgusting. Dirty vents, mold in bathroom, limited tv channels. It was not as expected. However Sherry (girl at front desk) was amazing. Went out of her way to help us out. OWNERS OF THIS HOTEL HAVE A GEM, as someone in the industry fire your house keeping manager and maintenance manager. Clean, Paint, Landscaping outside and a good manager to keep your people working. Most staff spent more time on phone than working. You could easily get $300 a night with happy customers that will return. It was renovated beautifully. You need an amazing manager with standards and one who after a few days of staying a guest should be able to pick out for looking like a manager.]
