[100394815951987104725,101109488550298955508,I've owned the same laptop for six years, and have recently had problems with the start-up and overall speed of the computer. Instead of getting a new one, I had a technician at Ace Duce look at it. He reformatted it and removed some viruses. After all that, my computer runs like it did years ago. Ace Duce's prices were reasonable, their service was fast, and their technicians friendly!! I would recommend them to any of my friends needing computer help and/or website development.]
