[112292014416728244144,100749672882164883279,2 months in our new house and the sewer backs up! After searching online I found Andrew and saw these great reviews. Unfortunately, he was in North Carolina at the time. I contacted my Home Warranty and they sent "their guy" over. He took one look at the line and said it was definitely tree roots, and it wasn't covered. I immediately text Andrew who said he'd come over as soon as he got back and look at it for free. He got back into town very late Sunday night and was at my house Monday. He actually looked at the problem, blew the line out with his high pressure sprayer and now PROBLEM GONE! All within an hour and much cheaper than what I believe any one else would have done it for. Thanks again Andrew!]
