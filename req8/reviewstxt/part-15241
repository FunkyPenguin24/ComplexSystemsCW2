[101911364540284235173,100979280344375121528,I've lived in Texas for 22 years and here for 3 and this is by far the best Mexican food restaurant I've found. I got the austinite. The meat was fresh and so were the ingredients. It was prepared well. I got a burrito and thought it was okay, but burritos aren't really my thing. Next time, I'm sticking to the tacos. This place would be perfect if they had homemade flour tortillas instead of those thin flat store bought ones. Also the place is a little small and dirty. Definitely a to-go order type of place.]
