[118148347203716552966,100295460629560800178,I have stayed at his hotel at least 6 times. This was the last. The valet parking is very poorly managed, you often have to sit and wait while they watch guests try to figure out what to do, nobody directing the two cramped lanes, one of which always seems to have an empty car just sitting there. The rooms are ridiculously small for the rate and the bathrooms are low end. They had cheap scott TP and a second fresh roll was jammed into the holder area so the roll in use could not even be rolled. No safe in the room, but you can put your valuables in the microwave. The lobby is really nice as are the checkin staff, but the rooms and valet are always pretty much subpar. The Westin is much nicer but the location is not quite as desirable. Lately you cannot even book a room for one night on the weekend via the web, you have to call and I was not given the rate discussed on the phone. That was the last straw.]
