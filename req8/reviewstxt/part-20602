[101435037704497437343,100091018296055363577,We come here every year for a show! It's always a fun experience!! You can't beat the prices, and the staff is always happy and cheerful while working. The Drive-in is a dying venue but Big Sky keeps the fight going! If you're visiting the Dells or are in the area this is a great evening experience.]
