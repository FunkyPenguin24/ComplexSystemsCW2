[100668086240349351872,101140809003947730870,The social, spiritual and intellectual benefits of a Montessori education are well documented and information is widely available online so I won't spend time lauding Montessori here. I will just say that Cascadia School is true Montessori with educators that serve the whole child, stimulate their natural curiosity, celebrate their unique attributes and challenge my sons to be their best selves. If I had a middle school experience like my son is getting at Cascadia, I would actually want to repeat middle school! He loves the field study trips in particular, unheard of in public middle schools! Cascadia's elementary programs are exemplary as well. My only regret is that my children haven't attended Cascadia longer, worth every penny!]
