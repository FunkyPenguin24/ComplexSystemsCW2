[106416031611202475913,100343957264385252775,Had windshield replace in July 2012 on a 05 Acura MDX. Poor experience. They didn't attach the trim properly for the review mirror, then when they tried to fix it they broke the windshield and damaged the center console LCD display. I had to bring it back another day to get the windshield replaced again and they only offered to pay for half of the replacement LCD display ($1000 new or $400 used) and would provide the labour. Now 6 months later my rear view mirror just fell off and is just hanging by a wire... I'm not impressed.]
