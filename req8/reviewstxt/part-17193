[111240826650382159598,101086677879026076160,This place is the real deal! I smoke my own chicken, ribs, and briskett, so I am very skeptical of the so called "BBQ" places in NJ. Hot Rods is hands down the best around. The wings are amazing. Thanks Toby and Anthony for such a great place to eat real BBQ.]
