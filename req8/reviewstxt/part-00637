[112657549647875593849,100192669946888450489,I am a detail oriented person, not in an annoying way (I don't think?)â€¦ In any event, our salesman Robert Batman, seriously his name, was so patient, very understanding and made the experience as effortless as possible. We currently have another BMW, and had already ascertained that BMW of Bridgeport was our preferred dealer for service. So the choice of dealer had been made, but we were lucky to find "Batman"!]
