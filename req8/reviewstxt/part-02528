[103179018308226057725,100289653272360442676,My granddoggie Summer visits Preppie Pooch every month and she gets a fabulous experience! Whenever her mom says it's time to go to the groomer's, she prances around and gets really excited. Summer just loves to go there. They do a great job and she smells and looks very pretty. Summer also loves the socializing. It's a great place and I recommend it to anyone who wants the best for their babies.]
