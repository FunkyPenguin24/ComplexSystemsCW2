[112722038242126100741,100734463350429851848,I brought in my 2009 Silverado for a regular oil and filter service. Service was excellent - I did try to set up an appointment but it was recommended that I use the Quick Lube. Unfortunately this was my biggest concern. An appointment means I can take the car in and pick it up - minimal fuss and I can plan my day. The quick lube was very busy, and it was a 2 hour wait. I brought work with me to do in the showroom so all was not lost (internet was not working though even though it was supposed to be). They did offer to drive me home and pick me up, but I just prefer having a plan - knowing when my car will go in and be ready. I would prefer to schedule my car for service. Still, the experience was very good and I was happy with the service I received. They did a very good job, which likely explains how busy they were when I came in. Staff were very friendly and I did enjoy seeing the new cars. I will go back but I will make an appointment. Price was good. I actually asked for the tires to be rotated - they suggested I didn't need it as wear was equal on all four - saving me $$. Nice touch and appreciated.]
