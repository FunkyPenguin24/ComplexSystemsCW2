[115337440459040358675,101067359384811901153,WARNING!!! DO NOT MOVE IN!!!! I have lived here for 5 monthS and have had a horrible experience with the apartment having black widow spiders. I have killed probably 6-8! The flooring in the bathrooms are peeling up and there is black underkneath....EW! Who would let people move in with that kind of condition....not good, honest people! The blinds were ancient when I moved and now they are broken in 1 room and the main lady said that I would have to pay because they install new ones for every tenant...WRONG...they are old and were never originally replaced. When I had moved in the 3rd floor, the deck was all rotted wood with nails sticking out and if you leaned on the railing you could pull it out!! I have a two year old and they said they would replace it and it took 2 months!!!!!! The AC went out when it was extremely hot and because it wasn't 93 IN MY APARTMENT, they wouldn't come and fix it but I have a two year old and he could have been harmed being that hot! They are CHEAP because they let people move in who cannot pay rent on time or EVER! I have seen some seriously weirD people there and do not feel safe. Originally when I had moved in they gave me the wrong set of keys and it was a weekend so I could not get in and no one would help me!!!! Yes they have big floor plans but they are 100 years old with NO work done to them. The windows are ancient and feels like they are open at night when it is cold. DO NOT MOVE INTO THESE APARTMENTS OR EVEN LOOK AT 1. NOT WORTH WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!! WARNING!!!]
