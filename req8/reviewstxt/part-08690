[116315473268844308231,100623405897908280349,Best pizza in Hudsonville/Jenison area. I'm partial to the Hawaiian pizza, which has a delicious mix of sweet/salty in the ham and pineapple. My wife likes the deluxe. My kids could live off the breadsticks. Overall outstanding food at a decent price with good service.]
