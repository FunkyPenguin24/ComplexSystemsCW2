[100690560658260983877,101132645157183289670,I had both of my children at Abington Hospital. My first son was born in 2009 and I had a emergency c section for a placenta abruption and was delievered by Dr. Rappe. She is the best and saved our lives!!! The NICU doctors and nurses were great and took great care of my son because he had to stay there 6 weeks until he was allowed to leave. My second son was healthy and also delivered by Womancare GYN in 2011. I would recommend the hospital to family and friends.]
