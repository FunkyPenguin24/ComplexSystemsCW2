[101143757933481654012,100400374066227404051,Great jazz club, when les paul was alive he would play here all the time on mondays! Now the jazz club recognizes him and the amazing man he was by dedicating mondays to him and his music. The food is always great and they have a lime gin and tonic that is amazing. Also i would recommend to get any of the appetizers. The shows are also a good price, always a fun night]
