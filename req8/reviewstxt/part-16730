[100171034390552256576,101059867336514035179,I was a little underwhelmed by my experience. I'll give you that the food at Victor's is ok. I had the suckling pig, and it was juicy, tender, and nicely flavored. But, the fact is that given the price to quality and quantity ratio, I really have had better. One thing i was really looking forward to was their lobster empanadas. Unfortunately they're done in such a way that these taste more like something you'd take out of a microwave than something you'd get at a restaurant. Also, their arroz con pollo is just yellow rice with a chicken breast sliced up on top, rather than all cooked together. So theres that to consider for any purists out there. So all in all, I'd say skip this place and if you're in the mood for Cuban/Latin American, go elsewhere.]
