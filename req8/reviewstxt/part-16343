[101701653070367214180,101038810422395378556,Rated service as excellent as there were long Q's but they were able to process our orders quickly. Staff were friendly despite how busy they were! ordered a small latte for Â£2.50 - too bad they only come in one size as i would have liked to order a large coffee. Am back for seconds - will go there once i finish this review!]
