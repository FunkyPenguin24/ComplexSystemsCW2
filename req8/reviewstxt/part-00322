[102712436962345732008,100175815025127933328,i love this place, its very hard to please me when it comes to chinese food, im use to the chinese food from the 80s which was too good, well this place resembles that flavor. the egg rolls are the best and the beef and broccolli is amazing. it is the cleanest chinese restaurant i have been in, keep in mind its more of a takeout joint than eat in. Enjoy!!!!]
