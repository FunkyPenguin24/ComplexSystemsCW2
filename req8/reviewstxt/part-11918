[105426075350706601987,100796485760814476753,I brought in a wool rug. I asked if it was worth cleaning. Was told oh yes this is a very expensive rug. bottom line they were unable to clean it, yet still charged me full price. I paid Tinny rug cleaners to clean a $400 rug that is now in my trash can. Owner has a gruff attitude and I will never do business with them again.]
