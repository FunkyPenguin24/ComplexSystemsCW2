[106657669889744678274,100152144559255162757,Joey helped me here on a saturday morning after I spilled coffee on my laptop and in panic mode. He was so nice, patient and went out of his way to give real advice and not just try to get me to pay the most expensive solution. Very genuine and helpful, thank you so much! Also a plus they are the only store I found open saturday.]
