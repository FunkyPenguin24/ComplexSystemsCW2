[116790952677562569104,100186164022972120070,Cash Camp CRUSH course at Big Slick was awesome! I have been playing NLHE for several years on and off but really got serious about my cash game this past year. I read books, watched videos, listened to podcasts, etc but I really wanted more hands on instruction. I researched classes/boot camps all over the country and found Big Slick. Because I live in San Diego, CA I really wanted to find a training where I didn't have to take too much time off work. I was very excited that they were hosting their first ever course of its kind. I read all the blogs and testimonials on the site and felt that Sean and Zach knew what they were doing and signed up. In comparison to other trainings I found online, I felt the price was fair and the chance to win your tuition back made it even better! Well Sean and Zach didn't disappoint. They are both incredible instructors and very patient with my questions. Sean really puts his heart and soul into his school and it shows. I was also very impressed with the high tech equipment at the school. I am really looking forward to getting a DVD copy of the class and our final table game to critique my play. I took about 100 pages of notes and am still digesting the information. They covered so many aspects of the game that I need to improve. I really feel like the course was packed with great content. So the real test was putting my new skills into practice. I left the class on Sunday and went to play at Winstar casino and I won more in my 3.5 hour session than the cost of the class! I know I will continue to improve as I digest this new information into my game. I feel like the most important thing I got from this course was more confidence when I sit down at a table now. If you want to take your game to the next level, go to their next Cash Camp CRUSH course.]
