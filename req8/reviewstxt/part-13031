[101413373197191470696,100858572296078155416,Lovely morning this morning at The Boars Head to 'celebrate' MacMillan Coffee Morning. Friendly staff, nice coffee and yummy cakes. Have eaten here on numerous occasions. The food has always been good and there is always a friendly welcome and at least one smiling face behind the bar. Looking forward to my next visit.]
