[101759887654612728769,100902572055032737762,I've dined here on several occasions, only because its my only option using public transportation. The first couple of times, the service was excellent. Lately, the wait staff have invited more of their friends and become a lot more attentive to their friends and not the PAYING customers. Management seems entry level. To have a pleasant experience, you need more experienced management. This place is going down hill fast. Who has ever heard of an established dining environment with a $2 Tuesday special? TERRIBLE and rapidly declining service.]
