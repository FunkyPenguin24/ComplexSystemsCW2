[101516731496947238376,100402844041507844771,Poorest customer service I have ever experienced! Their software was not as promised. Before I could get past the initial steps of initiating the software I discovered they they couldn't do what Edward told me it could. When I asked for my money back they just ignored me and stonewalled me for two months. Excuses ranged from they had to purchase a portal for me. But when I asked for a receipt their story changed to that it was my fault. That I should have realized that their software couldn't do what I wanted it to. The problem with this is that Edward had told me initially that it could do it. When I asked to speak to his manger Edward pretty much just ignored me and said that his manager was out and would get back to me in time. After repeatedly asking to talk to the manager and stonewalled for 2 MONTHS I contacted my Credit Card company. My Credit Card company agreed that Zaui was dishonest and returned my money. BEWARE!!!!]
