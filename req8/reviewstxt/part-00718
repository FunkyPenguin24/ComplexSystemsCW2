[109342480921195784015,100197056930615963093,This was my first time at The Cheesecake Factory and I absolutely loved it! I ordered Chicken Fettucine Alfredo it only took 10 minutes tops for me to receive my food. It came on a HUGE plate and the food quality was excellent! After only being able to eat a small portion the waitress boxed up our meals for us and we ordered dessert! You cannot go to The Cheesecake Factory without ordering cheesecake! Best cheesecake ever! And to top it all off, we had an excellent waitress who was very nice and attentive to our needs. She wasn't overbearing and she came around all at the right times. I also enjoyed the decor of the restaurant. It had dime lights and dark colored walls, which gave the room a calm, warm feeling. I loved it! Lastly, we went to dinner around 6:30 pm and we had no wait! EXCELLENT!]
