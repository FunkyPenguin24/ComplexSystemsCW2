[116559418799530474769,100143000969078585107,I easily check off all 5 stars for my experience at Shaker Family Ford Lincoln. From the moment I walked in and was greeted by Ed Shaker to when James Cianciolo shook my hand a final time before I drove off in my 2011 Honda Accord my experience there was excellent. Jim was especially helpful every step of the way; from our first phone call, through our test drive and signings, Jim answered all of my many questions thoroughly and was certain I knew the full answer and understood everything. Jim really helped me understand the whole process and his knowledge and experience was very easy to pick up on, and was comforting as a first-time buyer. This is a family-owned dealership with a great family-like atmosphere and I highly recommend Shaker Family Ford Lincoln to anybody looking to buy a new or used car.]
