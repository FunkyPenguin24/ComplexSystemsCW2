[105810411258993292327,101152229055292796418,Decided to take my 4 year old to Acute Care instead of emergency room - she had complained about arm pain for 3 hours. Was seen quickly, and Doctor Johnson quickly determined dislocated arm and resolved with excellent bedside manner. My daughter cried briefly, arm relocated, and convinced she was a tough girl. Better experience than emergency where we would have been in lower 1/3 for triage, likely waiting for hours for simple relocation of arm. Only $50 with my insurance instead of $200 for emergency and more pain for my 4 year old daughter.]
