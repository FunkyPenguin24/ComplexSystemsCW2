I always have a really good experience here buying shoes and have fewer aches and injuries since getting fitted for my shoes properly. On this most recent visit, I wanted less "mesh" on my running shoes since it's cold outside. Alex also suggested some socks they had and they are great. I am super picky about socks. OCD about them really. I like the indoor track to test out the shoes. This time the Brooks won over the Asics. But Alex brought out shoes he thought were appropriate and all of them felt great but one pair stood out. They ran great right out of the box.]
