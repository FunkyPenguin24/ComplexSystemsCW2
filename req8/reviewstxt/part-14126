[100625572638088261550,100918804277830684674,We are thrilled with the floors from Hardwood Bargains for our daycare! The install was easy and they are very durable which was important with a daycare setting. We have received many compliments on the quality and overall appearance. The customer service provided by Kurt Kucera was amazing and he was able to offer competitive pricing. We highly recommend Hardwood Bargains!]
