[117063776822382212571,100011734673578683865,Today I went there because I got a flat tire. Also I had a squeaky noise with brake. The Valero was the closet one from my home, just 3 minutes drive. They asked $22 for tire check and $22 for brake check. At that point, I was a little reluctant, because I heard there were some places that brakes check was free. He said checking costs $22 and if some part needed to be replaced, it would cost more. Anyway, I let them fix my car. 3 hours later, the manager called me that the work was done. They took out a nail from my tire (not sure how I got it) and cleaned the brakes without charging me more. Fortunately my brakes didn't need new part. =) Now my car is working fine. I'm satisfying with their work and will recommend to my friend.]
