[116133667830307191625,101025444370944576760,This is one of the best restaurants in the world! The food is second to none, the service is outstanding as the staff is friendly and super helpful, and the ambiance and the location of the place is in beach cove that I can only explain as heavenly and one of god's most beautiful creations. We've been to Maui 7 or 8 times as it's one of our favorite places to go on vacation. We never, ever leave that island without going to Mama's Fishhouse at least 2-3 times. Don't miss it!]
