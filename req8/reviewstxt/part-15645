[112825176045301747688,101001700041802839377,I have had a great experience living here since june of 2013. The apartments are nice. A lot of you professionals live here as well. Anytime there has been any issue in the apartment I have contacted the front office and they typically send out someone immediately and in both cases, i believe their names were Leino and Jodi, they were courteous, efficient and got the job done with a pleasant disposition. I would highly recommend Dover to any one.]
