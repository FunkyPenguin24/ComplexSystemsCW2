[105819856439532229398,101123525305552017147,My dog goes to Lucky Pawz once a week, every week. She is well socialized, taken care of, and we get to see how fun she has every day with the pictures online! It is a wonderful place, friendly staff, and I have never had a single problem. I would highly recommend (and I do) to everyone I know with a dog in the Iowa City area! I couldn't be happier with the service I receive there.]
