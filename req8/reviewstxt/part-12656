[100001296921195491042,100837230958095101152,WORST apartment management company ever! The manager (Kerria Janson) at Vierra Briarcliff promised us 4 months in a row to fix an issue we had (they had lost our deposit when they took over) We even showed her the copies of the payments! They never fixed it and then 5 months later serve us with an eviction notice and the amount is now almost double!! What the HELL is wrong with this company????? We are out of here as soon as our lease is up if this stupid company doesn't evict us sooner!]
