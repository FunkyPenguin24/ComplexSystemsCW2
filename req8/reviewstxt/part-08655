[115868869466474672615,100621441277669998596,I turned my ac on for the first time this week. Its been pretty mild weather and what do you know it wouldn't cool my house. I looked around online found this company WeatherGuard. There price for the service call seemed right and the cost of the repairs was even better. It turned out we just had a burnt wire he said because we didn't have the coils cleaned regularly. Something to do with pressures causing the wires to burn. I don't understand all the technical details but they explained it in a way that it made sense. When it was all said and done i paid a lot less then i expected the AC is blowing nice and cold. Great work. I would highly recommend there services]
