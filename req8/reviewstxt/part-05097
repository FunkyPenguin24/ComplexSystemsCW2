[100755319849112068553,100428499316616518042,Not the best Hungry Howie's I've had. When I first moved here, it was our staple "cheap, get it & go" dinner but after several "so-so" experiences we've moved on. I know HH has great crust because I've had it before but here it always seems burnt and leaves a funky taste in my mouth.]
