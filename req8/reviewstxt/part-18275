[110654078440345688246,101144045839759047602,This was my first time buying a car and the staff at McDonald Hyundai really took great care making sure I got into the right car for me at a price I could afford. Michelle Britton was amazing and really made me feel like she cared about me as a person and not just a sale. It was a bit of a long process but Michelle and Shane Schnacker (financing) were there every step of the way. I am so happy with my 2011 Sonata and love my new McDonald Hyundai family...I won't go anywhere else to buy a car because I know that they are the best!]
