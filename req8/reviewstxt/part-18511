[110336246275477464182,101156559565929210507,Drs. Ian and Lindsay Hoffman are some of the most amazing chiropractors that I've worked with. I'm a massage therapist and have worked with chiropractors for the past 10 years. About 6 months ago, I met Dr. Ian and decided to start seeing him in hopes he could help me with a sciatic issue I'd been dealing with for years. His knowledge and understanding of the body was exceptional and he knew exactly what need to be addressed in my body. Now after 4 month of treatments, I have little to no pain in my back. I was so impressed by their skills, I have started taking my daughter to see Dr. Lindsay. My daughter has some learning challenges and I'd heard that chiropractic care and help in some cases. After her first visit, I noticed some remarkable changes in my daughter. Her posture was changing, her receptivity was better, her attitude was different and her appetite had increased. To have such significant results after one treatment was enough confirmation for me. We have just begun treatment with my daughter and I'm really looking forward to all the amazing changes. Thank you Dr. Ian and Dr. Lindsay!!]
