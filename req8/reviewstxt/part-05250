[111177857685784273275,100438499150224814276,this museum has one BIG surprise up its sleeve: larger than life bronze sculptures, including kouroi - extremely rare, bronze kouroi: even the Athens Archaeological Museum doesn't have any, and the statues are in amazing condition. there's also a slab of marble carved with various units of measure (hand, foot, cubit etc) , to scale, from both greece and other countries such as egypt - absolutely unique. this was a couple of years ago and my memory is foggy - all the more so that photos I took, without flash, all came out bad (film camera...). you'll need a lens with a big aperture, say f2.8 or bigger. a nikon 85mm f1.4 or f1.8 would be perfect, as flash is prohibited. the museum does not allow photography in a couple of galleries of small objects. the bronze statues are AMAZING. just go. the museum staff enforces rules strictly but is friendly. almost forgot: the yachting port is just next-door. go have a walk around after the museum, to unwind your legs and take in the sea breeze.]
