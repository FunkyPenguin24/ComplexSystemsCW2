[102364761285041248447,100130061463769875398,Buying a trailer here was extremely easy. The cost was reasonable, the transaction was very smooth. We had a trailer in 20 mins. Highly recommended. Also, when I called Saturday morning, the phone was answered promptly and information was given which was exactly what was said in person when we got there. They are also open until 3pm on Saturday. This helps working folks who have a full time job M - F. Most of the competitors in the area either A. didn't answer their phone B. didn't call back or C. Close on Saturday at Noon. I would definitely do business with Jerry again.]
