[112799164600730737492,100204673013670109431,I think these bad review are from people who eat dominoes every week. CPK isn't just another pizza place, you won't get another version of pizza hut. If that's what you want, go to pizza hut. CPK has exotic pizzas that you would never think of. And they are all incredible! My personal favorite is their wonderful pear gorgonzola, which makes my mouth water every time I think of it! Definitely for the discerning palate, don't come here for greasy disgusting pizza, you won't find it anywhere on the menu.]
