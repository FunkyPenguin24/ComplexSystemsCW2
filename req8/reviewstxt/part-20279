[100082369488508967184,100075345387577375411,This is a hospital full of young, inexperienced, wanna be veterinarians. All they do is overcharge and provide no results. My first time there, I came in because my terrier showed signs of cataract, but the female, under 35 year old, vet told me that they didn't teach her about cataract in school and therefore we need to go to a specialist. She did, however, charged us $90 for the visit. We then went to Alton Road Animal Hospital, and when I told them what she had said, they just laughed and said that she needs to go back to school and stop missing classes. The second time we went there (because it was the only place open at 7 pm) was because my dog had signs of liver disease...drinking too much and eating very little. The vet, another under 35, told us that in order to determine what is the cause, he would need to do an extensive set of blood work ($300) which we agreed to since we wanted to know what was wrong with her. Well, when he finally looked at the results, he said that it might be the liver but the only way to know is by doing an ultrasound (another $300-$400). At that point we knew that he has no clue what he was doing and its time to head back to Alton Road Animal Hospital again. Bottom line, they have no clue and I don't think they care about the animals. There are plenty of Veterinarians out there that will help you and have years of experience. Good luck to all!!!]
