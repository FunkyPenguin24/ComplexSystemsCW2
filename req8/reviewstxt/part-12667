[108532353143453399985,100838106159222493237,I went to GL Ford to speak with a Sales Associate to get discuss my options once I returned by car to Courtesy Ford. The minute I walked into the building I was treated with the best customer service since Saturn of Okemos. The manager Chris came out and was talking with me while I was waiting for Rob to assist me. They offered me coffee and conversation. Rob Beckwith is an awesome sales associate he asked what I liked about my Fiesta and what I didn't and showed me a Focus I was not happy with the color then he showed me the sharpest ruby red 2014 focus hatchback ever! He had me at that point, he and his manager made me an offer I could not refuse and were the greatest team ever. I spoke with two other employees during my two day venture and they we as awesome as Rob. I think I have become a GL Ford lady; all they have to do now is wash my car and put a flower on my dash when I bring it in for service and that will be the frosting on the cake. Really go there and find our for yourself you will not be disappointed and don't forget to ask for Rob!]
