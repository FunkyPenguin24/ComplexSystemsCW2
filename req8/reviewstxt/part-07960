[105827064164644520097,100585676092669726168,The units are "okay", but the staff is frustratingly incompetent and dishonest. I lived there for 2 years and had my own car towed several times! I had outrageous charges at the end of my contract that were inconsistent with what I was quoted when I signed a lease. I was told by the leasing agent that the carpets were always replaced after 2 years and that I wouldn't have to worry about charges related to stains or tears, but in the end I was charged over $700 for wear and tear. Do not give them your business!!!]
