[106925641768866363807,100594067562919083532,Moving my office back to Austin from Florida after 15 years I needed help navigating an unfamiliar commercial market. A friend of a friend recommended Rebecca. She helped locate all of the spaces in the area I wanted to be in that fit my square footage requirements and my budget. She set up appointments for all of them and actually picked me up and drove me to most of them as well. She wrote three letters of intent and negotiated two leases, going back a couple times on the one I finally decided on. She made suggestions that I probably wouldn't have thought about. And she even got me free rent and below quoted rates in what is surely a landlords market. Oh yeah, and I got a pint of Guinness out of the deal too.]
