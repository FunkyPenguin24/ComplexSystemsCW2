[100383568928802924299,100254670793741260643,My experience with William Waldner was more than excellent - it was fantastic! From my first consultation meeting to the actual hearing, he always made me feel at ease and gave me all the information and tools I needed to feel 100% confident that my case would be a slam dunk. He was attentive and had genuine interest and concern for my individual case, while at the same time managed to be efficient and respond to my questions and concerns very quickly. All of this being said and after much research into other attorneys, his fee was very reasonable. With William's help, I can now focus on my future and I am on track to achieve financial freedom.]
