[100761145740922002018,100968710147534832941,This place changed my life! I still remember January 3rd, 2009. That was the first time I walked through the door at Next Gen as an out-of-shape and seriously overweight person. Fast forward 4 years and I'm in significantly better shape and health, and cannot imagine my life without the wonderful people at Next Gen. I've lost fat, built muscle, and found a competitive fire that I hadn't felt since high school sports. This is all the result of hard training under the expert coaching of Eric Barber coupled with a quality diet program that I learned about from Eric & his wife Luila. Whether you're a serious athlete looking for a competitive edge, or an overweight slob like I was looking for a way back to health, this is the place for you.]
