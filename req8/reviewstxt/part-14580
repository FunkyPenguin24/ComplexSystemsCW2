[104734745963867558099,100944165685896617375,Great service, great coaches. Just finished my program (i think total boot camp or immersion or something like that, it was 12 weeks). Learned a lot from these guys (and girls , thanks Antonia for filling me in on women's side of the story). It felt as it it was gym for my dating life. Individual attention, in field practice, plus doable and actionable assignment = a lot of fun and a lot of progress. Didn't expect much, and more so was my satisfaction when NYDC delivered and then some (Hunt you are awesome! day time meeting is actually enjoyable now). I have to do presentations all the time for my job, and i found myself doing much better on them, and getting more sales. Highly recommend to anyone who wants dating and communication skills improved. wish i done it years ago. I am dating a girl who actually is next door, we met in elevator of my building. Service is not cheap, but they say you get what you pay for. Certainly the case with NYDC.]
