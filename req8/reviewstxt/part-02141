[109014973503192463271,100269627687095526438,Went in the day after Christmas to see if they had any great marked down special. They didn't & I was disappointed. Also, the store was very cold - had to keep my heavy coat on & there were hardly any shoppers in the store (11 AM). Every time I go into this store, none of the staff (except cashiers) greet you or even smile. I thought they had a rule about smiling at customers & greeting them within so many feet. I've encountered this at every Wal-Mart in Arizona. It didn't used to be that way. The staff here is constantly busy re-doing displays or pricing during the day including peak hours, which is very annoying. I've seen stocking of shelves being done at peak hours, making it hard to go down the rows, especially in the grocery area. I went to Target right afterwords which was much busier, had more markdowns & the store was a very comfortable temperature. At Target, I was greeted by no less than 3 employees, all of who asked my if I was finding what I needed. Looks like I'll need to boycott Wal-Mart, at least for awhile.]
