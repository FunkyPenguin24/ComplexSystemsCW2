[116301714555513532291,100275919767320639804,McNeel Eye Center has been a great experience. Dr. McNeel has bent over backward to make sure all my concerns and questions are properly handled. I've spent a good amount of time in the office with various appointments between getting diagnosed and fitted for gas permeable contact lenses. In that time, I've always found the doctor and staff very pleasant and friendly. I'm not sure why one reviewer would ding them for only having one doctor. In my opinion, the centers with multiple doctors are nothing more than volume cattle calling with little or no relationship between patient and doctor. I believe a one doc practice will spend the time fostering good relationships with the patients, and that has been my experience with McNeel. I'd recommend them to anyone.]
