[113120845865858049802,100272043478437741510,My wife wanted to buy an acoustic guitar so we went to George's Music in WPB. After some time testing guitars, we decided to check for more guitars in another store in WPB. The lack of attention to us in that store was a strong determinant to went back to George's music and purchase the guitar there just because we felt treated in a personalized way. Besides George's Music store is modern, clean, and well organised. The managers in George's Music are wonderful people, they gave us enough time to decide, and helped us a lot. We really had a great time buying the guitar!]
