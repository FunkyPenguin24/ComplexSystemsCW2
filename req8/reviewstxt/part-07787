[116430771694412815725,100576315331625973224,Bought a bike here back over the summer. Tom helped me out and asked me questions to help get me set up with the bike that fit me physically and for my activity. While he has alot of carbon and high end bikes in the store, he recognized that I needed a good basic hybrid that happened to be one of the least expensive bikes in the store. The staff here ask questions and work to get you on the right equipment - not just make a sale.]
