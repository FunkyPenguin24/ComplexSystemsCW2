[106050018481712549196,100944134654100921313,I picked up a lot of photographic pearls the last two weekends at Mike's Camera Seminars, 4 events in two weekends. 1) Wildlife Images with Impact! With John Vansteenberg 2) Photo Safari at the Zoo to Test Drive camera lenses, bodies and tripods. I sampled a 600 mm fixed Nikon lens and a Tamron 18-270 zoom, got some great lion and monkey shots. 3) Next day, back to the store for a gentle review and critique of the zoo photos with John Vansteenberg. 4)Following weekend: a two hour seminar with Me Ra Koh on Unlocking the Magic of Children. All the events were interesting, non-intimidating, professionally run, started on time and we had an opportunity to ask questions. These events are basically free: they cost $20, but you get a $20 gift card to be used at the store. I met some fellow photographers to network with and improved my skills.]
