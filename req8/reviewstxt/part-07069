[112287176943296662843,100535581455687141373,Myself and my wife ordered the Pollo Carbonara and the Pollo Avocado & Fungi Penne. All I can say is that the chicken in both of these dishes was just terrible! And there wasn't even a hint of avocado in the Pollo Avocado & Fungi Penne. And the pasta was not even of home-cooked quality. It seems to me that the chicken is cooked in a very asian style. The meal was probably the most un-Italian meal I've ever eaten at an Italian restaurant.]
