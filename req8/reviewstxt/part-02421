[102943420598198444050,100283715963638543133,Scott did a superb job repairing my grandmother's antique tip top table base that my teenagers had broken and tried to repair with superglue. He had excellent pricing and great skill to fix that break, and another break that I hadn't even noticed. I highly recommend Gressitt Studios!]
