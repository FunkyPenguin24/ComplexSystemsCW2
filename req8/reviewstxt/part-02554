[116956995567910322148,100290553167302462779,I paid 250â‚¬ for two days of stay. I had to present at the show that was being held the next day in the hotel. My room was next to the lift and after asking to change I was told there was no rooms available. At 12:30am I went downstairs and requested either a room change or I am checking out as I could not sleep next to the lift. I then got changed to a smoking room. I will not stay again.]
