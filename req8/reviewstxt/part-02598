[110697235724705036020,100293189524592035975,Let me start with the key componet why I purchased "Darren Lazar"! Had he not followed up with me and kept in contact via text and e mail I would not be driving my 335i Convertible today. I came in at 5pm on aTuesday night just looking, Wed night he sent me a tocuh base e mail Thursday a touch base text outlining the offer, I countered and the next thing I knew I was driving away in my Dream Car. He made it happen along with his team and never once did I doubt they had my interest at heart. I love my car and I loved my expereince at Braman, Thank you Darren :) Your professionalism and follow through made my experience seemless and enjoyable. Thank you and Thank you Raj.
