[103735959662972133687,100773512044156001723,I stayed at this location on the 24th of October. I have stayed and many HI Express inns as I am a Gold member - I was not impressed here. Not with the dried out eggs, Under cooked bacon and a toaster that would only cook on one side. The 60s styling was not appealing and for this location a bit pricey. My main complaint here is that I made a mistake and left my dirty clothes bag on the bed and when I got home I realized this and called back. The person on duty said she had no report. The next day I called back and was told to report it to their lost and found. I did - a week later no reply. I called again and they said they would look into it and get back to me - a week later they have not. I tried to call their number 5 times today and it picks up and then hangs up. Now I realize I made the mistake of forgetting the bag, but someone there has over $500 worth of my clothes and did not turn it in. That is a reflection on my entire stay at this location. If you cannot trust the employees, then how can one feel safe.]
