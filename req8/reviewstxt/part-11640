[115825940735992865650,100782273433422020944,I got a chance to have Indra shot for me at one of the weddings. I'm very impress with his personality and professionalism. He was there on time as scheduled. Very courteous to the guest. He pays attention to detail & surrounding. I truly believe that he put 110 percent in everything that he does and 120 percent in the things that he truly loves. I saw that he is passionate in Photography and the desire to give his client the best images that he knows how. Last but not least, he is educated & and reliable. What more do you ask from a photographer.]
