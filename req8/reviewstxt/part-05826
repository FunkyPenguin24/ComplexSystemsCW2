[106790885574049858286,100468025317062336771,i used to be a regular customer with Elston Auto when i was a student at Purdue University, and moved to the west coast of Florida the day after I graduated...i recently had car issues and to get the car (2001 Dodge Stratus R/T) looked at by a Chrysler dealership alone was $110, which was not feasible and did not work well with my budget. I called Elston Auto and talked with Jay, describing the symptoms of my car, and he was able to advise me what to do and how to fix it, and low-and-behold, the car runs and sounds great again! even a 16-hour drive away, Elston Auto is reliable, and Bless everyone that works within the company!]
