[111017525207021294325,100795609897989016505,One of the best times of my life. I've never been camping before, and I brought my fiancee, and two daughters with me. On day 3, we went to Swain County and got married, and spent our honeymoon at your campground, and decided to stay an extra day because it was so wonderful!!! I'm looking at some of the negative reviews and just can't fathom that these naysayers went to the same place. The staff was beyond friendly and very helpful, they answered all of my questions, and all of the amenities worked and were clean. Their on-site store had all of the emergency groceries we needed (the closest grocery store, Food Lion, is about a 20-minute drive from the campground).]
