[103435141283229566799,100375318474712033640,I am 24 years old and have only known ABC cake shop to be the place to buy cakes. History dates back to my mom buying her Wedding and baby shower cakes there. So they have always had amazing and delicious bakery goods, up until 1 year ago. At that time we started to see a change in quality, d√©cor and pricing. Yet we have such ties to them that we all felt compelled to give them another chance or so. Yet it was this weekend when I went to pick up my sister-in-laws Med School graduation cake that honestly looked out of this world ridiculous. It looked nothing like the picture and the Manager Amanda admitted that it wouldn't be something she is proud of. There was no refund of any amount, no complimentary anything. Yet all they could do is touch up the thumb prints in the cake and fix the miss-print in name that was clearly on our order form. I was so tempted to get my money back and leave them with their cake, yet we were an hour until the reception. They treated us horribly and it look like an apprentice baker made it days before we picked it up. So sad and disappointing because I will never go back after so many years of going.]
