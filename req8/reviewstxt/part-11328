[109166895991245979983,100765559435785584552,What a great hardware store! Everyone is really friendly and they even helped me when they were about to close. I called wanting to get 4 x 2x4 pieces of wood to support my aquarium stand and they not only got them done quickly, but accurately. I will definitely be coming back when I make another fish tank stand.]
