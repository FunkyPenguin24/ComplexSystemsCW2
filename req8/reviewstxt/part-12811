[111913979101367924238,100846489366366016132,Brian K. came by this morning, he was very courteous, informed me of what he was going to do, asked if we had any special concerns. He stayed for a good half-hour, checking around, removing cobwebs and applying products. It seems to me he did a very thorough job. We've been using Alterra for a little bit over a year now and have been very pleased with the service.]
