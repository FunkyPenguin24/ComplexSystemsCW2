[105381653141531554201,101102462398539407795,I never thought I’d try yoga again, but Dahn Yoga is different, and at this Alexandria center after a couple months, I’m physically and mentally stronger than I’ve been in years. I’m still no athlete or human pretzel – just a writer with a few decades of broken bones, sprains, dislocations, bumps and bruises. My current options are low-impact, though I’m usually more adventurous, and will get back to the crazy stuff, but I won’t give up the Dahn Yoga. Here, I get an hour of a workout as strenuous or relaxing as I choose. Every time I walk inside, I’m welcomed like a beloved family member at Thanksgiving Dinner. When I leave, I’m hugged, given a smile and good wishes. Of course it all makes me want to go back. What better way to motivate people to take care of their body and mind? In every class, our master has us bow to greet each other, of course. Imagine: a centuries-old symbolic practice of human respect that today serves no legal function for safety or security. Just civilized acknowledgment of other people sharing an experience. What better way to promote friendship and peace? Uniforms or suggested loose flowing clothes make it impossible to see bulging muscles, scars, or love handles. What better way to reduce insecurities and inhibitions? In addition, our eyes are closed at times, or the lights dimmed for specific movements so as to reduce sensory input, and let us focus on our own bodies where there’s tightness or blockage, to open it up – even the brain. What better way to create physical AND brain fitness? I’m in! Call it Life Particles. Energy. Karma. Electricity. Whatever. A rose by any other name… But do find it at least once in your life. OK, now. Go here. Close your eyes, and see for yourself.]
