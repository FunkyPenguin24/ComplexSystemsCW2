[102634110060189171456,100369239190541079253,The only thing that I admire most is their green tea ice-cream. Other disks are horrible. I have tried different types of Sushi in Japan and other areas in Asia. I like Asian style sushi, not Americanized Sushi. I've also tried different Sushi places in Provo. However, I've not found a good one yet!]
