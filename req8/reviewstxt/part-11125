[112102084321974360628,100754783558173157930,For many years, I have worked with the people at Progressive Business Publications on various projects that benefit thousands of students and adults in the Philadelphia area. PBP continues to support educational activities that help prepare our young people for a future in the global marketplace, and also offer opportunities for adults to learn more about the world in which they live. Kudos to Progressive Business Publications for taking an active role in education in our Philadelphia region.]
