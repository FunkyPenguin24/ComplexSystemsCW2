[114542464645665704569,100907086265802164452,Guy was waiting to take us to the courtesy bus , 5 mins and we were at the office all very helpful , the car we had was better than we thought , and all went very well The paying for a full tank of fuel was not good and expensive , we returned the car half full so lost out badly , the damage checks were not correct,[], so always check before you depart and tell the office , Having full damage waiver was great , but again expensive , but when in Spain you never know what will happen, all in all great and would definitely book again.]
