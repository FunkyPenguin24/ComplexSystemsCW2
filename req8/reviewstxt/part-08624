Our salesman, Soloman, was very knowledgeable about the Honda Accord and took a lot of extra time before we left to program our phone to the bluetooth and set all the other settings to our liking. From the moment we walked in the door, we felt the difference! Everyone was extremely friendly and helpful! We will definitely go back next time we are in the market for a new car.]
