[102313890665666632034,100194900760601860765,WORST PLACE EVER IN UNIVERSAL CITY TX. My family and I lived there for 12months, they told us when we moved in that the sure deposit as well as the MONTLY pet insurance would be for any damanges.Now that we have moved they want us to pay them 1200 dollars. DONT GO THERE IF YOU HAVE PETS. After moving out, they also called me and asked if I had a washer and dryer, but it was my own washer and dryer. Then they tried telling us after living there 11 months we couldnt have a grill on our patio, it took them 11 months to do the inspections to notice that we had one. There is a high turnover and the organization is terrible. Best adivce to give to those looking for a place to live would be to NOT go to them.]
