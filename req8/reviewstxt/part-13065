[116329770288360728256,100860622807871413680,I've only ever had take out, so I've never seen the inside. I've had T. Jin a few times. I used to order from a different restaurant, but I will definitely order from here now on. Portion sizes are huge. The pieces of chicken are so big, you will have leftovers. We ordered Orange Chicken, kids sweet and sour, and kids lo mein. The lo mein filled up an entire take out box, worth the $4.95! I have had beef and broccoli, orange chicken, sesame chicken, kung pao chicken, and the lo mein. They are all delicious!!]
