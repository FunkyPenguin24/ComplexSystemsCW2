They have high volume so the produce is better than at most - I won't buy produce at either New Berlin locations and the Waukesha West location is not as good either. The one on Bluemound is OK too. Good selection on other items, although some of the better things are being replaced by Roundy's brads. I agree with the service issues on other reviews, but I don't shop for the experience. I have tended more and more to go to Sendik's as the produce is even better and I can shop in much less time.]
