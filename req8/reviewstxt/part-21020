[102226420779068106618,100113628530793755652,**** Update... they refunded the money of that worthless Landry's card. Admit it, people only go here because the movie was awesome... and it's pretty hard to mess up crab legs. Plus who doesn't want to quote Forrest Gump while eating dinner? Anyway, my experience with Bubba Gumps in Chas was fine.... except for the inept waitress who got us to sign up for a Landry's Select Club card.... Allegedly, this card would act like any store card where you get points for spending money and then you get free stuff. She said the card was $25, but as soon as you signed up online, you got the money right back, so it would be a free card. WRONG. You sign up and then see that you don't get your money back... all you've done is spend $25 toward your next meal at Bubba Gumps. Who would do that? Why would anyone pay forward a meal? I mean, Haley Joel Osment might, but even that idiot died at the end of that sappy crap fest "Pay it Forward." So I called Landry's to get this taken off the bill. They had me call the general manager to get a refund. The general manager acted as if I had asked him to sire my first born. Then he said he would call me back after he talked to Landry's. Well, that was like 20 minutes ago and I have yet to hear from him. We'll see how this goes. I knew I should have just gotten frozen crab legs from Publix and made them at home. It would have been a hell of a lot cheaper than what I spent at Bubba Gumps. But, as Forrest said so long ago, 'stupid is as stupid does.']
