[104001558727445630759,100782522836878513864,I went shopping for last minute items for Christmas. When the cashier was ringing up my order one of the toys didn't come up in the system. She asked me how much it was, I didn't know, but said I would go get another one. When I got back to the register an assistant manager was removing all of my gift cards that the cashier had just rung up and they were going to re-check me out at a different register. When I asked why I had to move, they decided to open a register next to me and help the customer behind me get all of his groceries off the conveyor and placed at the new register. Then they had a manager come and clear out all their deletions & re-rang me at the same register. This wasted a good 20 minutes of my busy day all for a toy that wasn't in the system. When I finally got to pay for my items, I had to ask the assistant manager to move as he was right behind me & I didn't need him watching as I entered my pin number. There might not be a lot of competition here, but Walmart is just down the street. And next time that happens I won't be so nice about helping them find prices. I wish I had just walked out. The assistant manager and the cashier had no common sense and between the two of them not thinking about what they were doing, they lost a loyal customer.]
