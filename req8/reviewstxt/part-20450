[102347276503474657690,100083669613613349035,Best car buying experience ever!!! Eddie Daye made purchasing my new 2013 300S an absolute joy! I told Eddie what I was looking for and the price I was hoping to get and he made it happen. I was driving an hour (from Mooresville) to purchase the vehicle so Eddie had all of my paperwork ready before I arrived and I was in and out of the Dealership in record time. I would recommend Eddie Daye and North Point to anyone in the market for a car and I will absolutely use them for my next car purchase.]
