[108027830277863323401,100733168617061517325,Purchasing a vehicle at Covert in Bastrop is a positive experience, no back and forth between sales people and haggle here and there. Buster, by now our personal sales rep. knows what he is talking about, polite, to the point and precise. The finance person Jonathan is cut from the same cloth, very knowledgeable and to the point. We came in, told them what we liked and within a record time where on our way in a new vehicle. The service department too, will go through all the hoops to get you back on the road as fast as possible. Last year we where time bound but had an urgent recall on a Suburban LTZ (2011) and it was taken care of in a quick and highly professional way. Covert, you sure have my business.]
