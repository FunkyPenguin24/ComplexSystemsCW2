[107505969209952342173,101059078692853146981,Tony has been cleaning and servicing our pool for several years now. He is always here each week, the same day taking care of our pool. Prior to Tony, we 'managed' our pool ourselves - it was frequently green and hard to keep looking nice and inviting. Since Tony we have NEVER had any weeks where our pool didn't look pristine. He is always looking out for our best interest and I would highly recommend him to anyone.]
