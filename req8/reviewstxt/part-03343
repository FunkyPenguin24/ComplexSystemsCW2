[115535945367394557677,100331733239686065168,I bought $3000.00 worth of trees from this company. They all Died within 10 months. I cannot even get a phone call from the owner even though I have made several trips to the nursery and filed a complaint with the Better Business Bureau. Not just one or two trees died. All Twenty trees purchased died within ten months. Very poor way to do business. I cannot recommend this company. I will not be doing anymore business at Faltz Nursery.
