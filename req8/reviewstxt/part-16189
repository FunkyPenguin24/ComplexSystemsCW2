[116610740498439720208,101031187772915637753,Great ISP, I have used them since July. Never have had an outage, internet is always FAST(17-20mbps), far superior than Comcast and CenturyLink. Plus you cannot beat the price @ $39.95/month, the bill never changes. I am very happy with them, and would recommend them to anyone in American Fork.]
