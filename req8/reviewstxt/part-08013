[107092940371240664454,100588375607994732036,The staff is friendly and very helpful. They are personable and down to earth.I love the selection of clothing,shoes & gear they have. Its very balanced.I went in to buy a pair of Toms they had on sale & they couldn't find the match in the back room so they looked through their inventory for it and called me to let me know it was lost( total bummer) but they'd gladly help in any other way that they could. Went in & got new toms this week! Yeah!]
