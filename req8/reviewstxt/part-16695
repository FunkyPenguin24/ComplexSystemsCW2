[116134051914621717381,101058597140781651698,After doing much research regarding lost data (family photos, music, etc.) on my external hard drive, I took a chance on West Seattle Computers. They were able to rescue my information successfully--and for much less than other quotes I received. The service was great--personable and friendly. I will return for all my PC needs and highly recommend them to anyone.]
