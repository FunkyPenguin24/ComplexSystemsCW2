[109167950221939875234,101133739239014394556,AWFUL! WORST EXPERIENCE WITH A ONLINE ORDER EVER! I ordered 3 items on a Wednesday, 1 item on Friday and 1 on Saturday! I received Friday and Saturdays order on Monday with NO PROBLEM! A scarf and shorts. Well shortly after getting my black lace shorts they ripped! Then I emailed them regarding my other shopment and NO RESPONSE! This went on several days! I FINALLY opened my mailbox and saw a package. I was so excited.. THEN realized it had ONE item in it EVEN thought It stated on the package there were 3 items, a dress, shorts and a scarf. All I got was shorts. I IMMEDIATLY emailed the company about my package and ripped shorts! She didn't email me back till I finally posted a picture of the ONE item and the package on their FB! She then told me it wasn't their fault it took so long to get package and that I understand. But what i didn't understand was she said she "emailed" about my dress being out of stock on the 9th *number 1 I didn't order till 10th, never got that email* she also never mentioned the scarf! When I responded to the email I informed her that I never recieved her email and that I would like a different dress in return of the one they didn't have and to please mail my scarve as it was not to me yet either. She did tell me I could replace my shorts or return them as to they had NEVER had a problem before.. This all occured on the 17th! I still have recieved NO reply regarding dress or scarf I have already paid for! I DEF DO NOT RECOMMEND UNLESS YOU WANT THE RUN AROUND AND FOR THEM TO TAKE MONEY WITH NO PRODUCT IN RETURN!]
