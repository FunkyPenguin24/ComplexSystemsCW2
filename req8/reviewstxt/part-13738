[106954209339490657610,100897968902032343033,We were hoping for a Chinese restaurant to deliver to us since we live kind of far from most places. One day we got a flyer in the mail, so we called to order. We were very impressed with both their food, the packaging that the food came in, and the quick service we received. Their prices are excellent also for the quality of food that they produce. I had never been there before so I don't know about previous management, but this was only a month ago and I couldn't say enough about how great our experience was then. We are pretty picky about food too and were not pleased with any other Chinese restaurant in Greensburg. Thanks for your great service! ps: I really have no idea about the decor since we had delivery services (since google asks us to rate that too..)]
