[104935233674305639407,100253910813855462142,My first experience at The Lane Spa was through a gift certificate from a group of friends for my birthday. I had a 60 deep tissue massage, I can't remember her name but it was really great. The atmosphere and staff working there was perfect! I've been to many day spas, vegas, Los Angeles, Toronto and in the Caribbean and The Lane Spa is up there in my favorites. Since my first experience I have been back for many massages, facials, and most recently began getting my hair treatments at their salon with John ( who is fantastic ). I enjoy my time there and feel like i've stepped away for a little slice of heaven in my own backyard. See you soon!]
