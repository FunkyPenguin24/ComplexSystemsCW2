[100646721083821319155,100674659208976086830,It's not an Inn, there are no rooms to rent. The name is historical. There is good gourmet drip coffee, beer, milkshakes, good homemade pie and cookies, a few dry goods, free wifi, and a free jukebox. It's a great restaurant where you can talk to locals! Good well water too.]
