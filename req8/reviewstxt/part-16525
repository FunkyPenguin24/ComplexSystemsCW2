[113221637099032856557,101048287906519972771,Murphy''s Law and my Wife are Soul mates. Murphy seems to always tag along and cause malfunctions with computers, cell phones, cameras, ipads, and yes even garage doors. Somehow a broom stick was magically leaned against the inside of our brand new garage door's track (A1 had just installed 45 days prior) while my wife was doings some spring cleaning in the garage. Later that day we had to go over to my parents house, and I pressed my garage door remote in my car as I drove away from the house not thinking anything of it. When we got home the Garage Door was crooked, and as I began to investigate I notice that the broom stick prevented one side of the garage door from going all the way down, which bent the track and made it impossible to repair myself. I was embarrassed to call A1 and tell them why I needed them to come out to take a look at it to see if they could fix it. They came out right away and fixed it for free. They did not have to do that but they did. They have a customer for life.]
