[116003590414815358889,100671909148411382464,I had the best experience at Bill Volz's. My sales rep, Shari Roufberg was extremely helpful. She was very patient, detailed and honest with all the information she provided for me. The whole process was done in a very timely manner. I am very satisfied with my new Jeep Patriot and with the help I received at Bill Volz! Over a week after my purchase and Shari is still answering all my questions and concerns via email! I would definitely recommend this dealership!]
