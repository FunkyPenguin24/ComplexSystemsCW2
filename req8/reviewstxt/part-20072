[100651366242422443473,100064293117414056850,Excellent place for casual dining with a full service experience! Awesome how you can pick exactly what you would like in your meal. You can even customize how it's presented with mushu rolls or lettuce wraps or even soup. Parking is definitely a bit difficult but there are a few lots around that are free after 5 and garages on campus that you can easily walk from.]
