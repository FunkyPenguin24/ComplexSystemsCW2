[116045658591814350190,101072404285415014491,I've moved around alot and this is by far the best movers and customer service we have ever encountered. They moved around our boxes like Tetris masters and treated everything with care. Joe and Todd, the movers, arrived on time and had everything done in the allocated time. Charlie's customer service is spot on.]
