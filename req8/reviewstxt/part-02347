[102996547412356016123,100279781871756769187,As a first time car buyer, I was nervous about the whole car buying experience. We had gone to another dealership in Pensacola and weren't impressed with their sales people, or their selection. We came to Sandy Sansing and Billy took care of everything for us. He found us as many cars as he could for me to test drive, so I could find the one that felt just right. He suggested different cars that we hadn't thought of, and we ended up choosing one of his recommendations. Billy went above and beyond for us, and made sure that I was 100% satisfied with my experience and purchase. I will definitely be going back to see Billy for my next car!]
