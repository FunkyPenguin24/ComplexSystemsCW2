[107097588065472050312,100756288423092726161,I decided to purchase my new car audio deck at ABC basically because they have "free" instillation. I knew I would probably slightly overpay for the deck to offset the fact it had free install. I paid a little over 130$ with install for a deck/install parts that would cost between 90-100$ on amazon so i came out pretty well. The install took only about 25-30 minutes and was clean, and the deck sounded great. As far as customer service goes, don't expect much. The guy at the car audio counter didn't even acknowledge the fact I was in the room , until i approached and told him i was looking to buy. He was pretty rude, but i never expect much when buying retail. While waiting for my install i bowsed the store and noticed much of whats for sale isnt priced directly, forcing you to interact with sales people. Do your homework before hand,[],no what yor buying, and youll be good]
