[100865053423487268588,101173255479721609569,We first tasted their wines at 2012 Bite Of Oregon where they won Best Of Show. Liking every wine we sampled at their booth, we visited this little family-run winery in the heart of downtown Dayton over Thanksgiving weekend. We were so struck by the elegance and depth of every one of their Pinot Noirs we tried, that we joined their wine club. This is a big deal for us; we visit the Willamette Valley twice yearly to taste Pinots and this is the first winery whose wine club we have joined. Their Pinots not only taste beautiful but they have high value pricing as well. Nicely done. Well worth a visit, even if it is a little off the beaten path.]
