[106850841499077487709,100688532032577117862,I recently purchased a new Chrysler Town and Country at East Hills Chrysler Jeep Dodge and couldn't be more pleased with the experience! The purchase price was better than the other two dealers I visited. The sales rep explained every option and sat and showed me how it all worked so I could decide if this was the vehicle for me, and what options I would want in it. I dealt with the service department as we were having a trailer hitch installed on our new vehicle, and not only was the installation immaculate, but they provided a loaner vehicle for me! I will be back for my servicing and the next time I need a new vehicle! -Matthew]
