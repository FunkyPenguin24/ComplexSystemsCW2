[113166480610629849237,100189983049129995444,I was really nervous about finding a church that my family and I were comfortable with. I wanted something that was more active with family, and especially the children. Well, Rockfish is the place to be and feel comfortable. My husband does not go very often to church, and I must say that he loved it! We did not feel like eyes were all on us, We were heart lifted and happy that we went there.]
