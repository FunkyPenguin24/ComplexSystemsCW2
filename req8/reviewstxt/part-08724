[104364877556644301086,100624727845704565233,The Cliffs looks good on the outside, but is not too great on the inside. Maintenance was lackluster. Things were never replaced. We lived in an apartment for 2 years with a refrigerator that made so much noise we had to run a fan in our bed room and close the door to sleep over the din. They saw no problem with it because it kept food cold. The carpeting was very old and impossible to get clean. The appliances were all old. Our toilet barely worked, but was never replaced. These things nag at you and make life annoying. We finally left because the non-smoking policy in the building was not being enforced by an ineffectual management staff and I was suffering terribly with asthma and migraines due to the smoke seeping into our apartment. Nothing was done, and an investigation of air flow or the smell inside my apartment was never attempted. Doctor bills and moving expenses were high, yet they didn't refund our full deposit, citing carpet stains. They did let me out of my lease due to my health issues three months early, because all they could find for me on the property was an apartment which would amount to a $400 rent increase which we couldn't access it for a month and a half. I would never live there again. Too many maintenance hassles and ineffective property management. But the smoke in the building, which we had to sign at lease renewal we would not do, was the last straw for us. Can't live without air.]
