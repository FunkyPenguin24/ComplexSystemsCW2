[102396367194753064047,100665376535220057303,I went to Valley Honda to look at 2013 Honda Civic Si's. There I met Tom Propersi. We had briefly talked over email when I requested a quote. He was very helpful and never felt pushy or like he was just trying to get a sale from me. He let me know that the 2013 model had not yet came, but they had a few 2012 models for a lot less. He was very patient and informative the entire time. I would recommend if you are looking for a Honda to ask for Tom Propersi.]
