[101742652139778020480,101075480727422755687,I honestly can't say enough good things about the job that Tara did on my makeup for my wedding. I gave her a picture of what I wanted and she completely nailed it! Not only did the make up look great, but I felt like a superstar when I was finally able to see the finished product. I have to say, I was also really impressed with how long the makeup stayed on. Through the ceremony and vows to the dancing extravaganza during the reception... it didn't fade, it didn't run, and I left with the makeup looking just as beautiful as it did when she applied it 10 hours before! Tara is also such a great person. She fit right in with all of us and we laughed and had a great time getting ready. If you are in the market to get your makeup done for a wedding or any other special event, look no further. Stop right here and call her. You honestly won't regret it!]
