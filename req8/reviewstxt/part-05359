Price is not everything and better to pay a bit more for a proper and professional job than waste your money at this awful establishment. I had an initial appointment for a shellac manicure which was confirmed the previous day. I stressed to the receptionist that I only had a 40 minute window which she confirmed would be fine. I arrived and was told that I had to wait 30 minutes as they could not fit me in. My appointment was rescheduled and when I showed up the second time, I again waited for about 15 minutes before they put me in the pedicure room. There was no table and someone came and tried to remove my current shellac and in the process, spilled acetone on my handbag and pants. I asked to move to the manicure room, which was dirty. The manicurist had no idea how to remove shellac, and spent 45 minutes trying to take it off. I asked for my nails to be cut and filed and she cut one nail down so short it started to bleed. I didn't even stay for the whole manicure - as soon as my nails were filed and buffed, I left in disgust.]
