[110897734817869951892,100983578368378888928,I have been working out at Shape Up for going on a little over 2 months. My biggest takeaway is the staff itself - always encouraging, always pushing you to do a bit more than you thought you were able to do. In the 6 weeks I've been training there, I have lost a total of 28 lbs. and feel better than I have in many years. And it's not like I'm working out 7 days a week, for 2hrs at a time; I go roughly 3x a week, for an hour at a time. The results are incredible, but the workouts are fun and engaging. The environment is fantastic; it's not a "musclehead" facility - rather, it's a light atmosphere with lots of joking and even more encouragement. The training staff is knowledgeable & friendly. The workouts are challenging yet a lot of fun. I leave every day exhausted, soaked in sweat, but feeling better than I did when I walked through the door. Working with Shape Up is a great experience and one I recommend highly!]
