[108599360458965054259,100529764346161747003,I have had many different types of pets and lived in many places and found that Banfield is in general very convenient, they can get your records anywhere in the country in a matter of minutes with just your name. I have mostly only gone to the Eagan location but i can tell you that they know me and my pets by name and genuinely care. The doctor is always firm and honest with me, which I need seeing as how I know how to keep a dog happy but not healthy. When my little guy got sick I called in a panic the front desk staff asked me to hold, after about 10 seconds my dog's primary Doctor picked up and was ready to listen as if I was the only person in the world. He took the time to listen to my probably unrelated worries. He researched and contacted specialists to make sure my dog got the best care. I decided to wait with my dog for the day even though they probably would have preferred I not watch over their shoulder all day they let me. The front desk girl checked in on me periodically to make sure me and my dog were okay. I recommend this Vet Clinic to everyone I know with a pet!]
