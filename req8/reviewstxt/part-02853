[109216552568383454278,100305911863457754088,i got my garage door installed by doors in motion and in less than aweek the door was off track,i called them back and the guy wont send me a repairman unless i pay the trip charge,after i threatened them by calling my lawyer they sent me a repairman driving a sedan car that he had to call another worker since he didnt have tools with him.very bad experience and nightmare.i would never recommend them.]
