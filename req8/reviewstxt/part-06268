[113844084460169630586,100490683024518499251,Knowledgable staff, not complaints with how they treat their animals and the Vet seems to know his stuff no problem. But a few of the staff have personalities that I find a bit stand offish, including the Vet, he's a nice guy but he's in and out and doesn't explain that much. I've tried to get them to explain to me multiple times how many shots my kittens need or how many they have had and what not. No matter how many times I ask I keep getting confused and they run in circles and don't fully answer me. I know it's not their intent to be confusing but it's frustrating. The first time I took my kittens in I tried to get the Vet to explain how many shots and the prices and what they needed I I kind of got brushed off as he gave my kittens their shots without fully explaining what the shots were. NOT OK. I understand it is a busy clinic but everytime I call them they are putting me on hold 3 or more times. It's not completely their fault as people in the clinic should honestly be letting them finish on the phone first but its very annoying. Hold once is fine until you are done with customers but when you pick the phone back up please focus on me. I find this odd as every time I've been in there has inly been 1 other customer in the waiting room every time. They gave me photocopies of their records which I cannot understand very well at all. I have two kittens, same age and siblings, and one record is missing a bunch of stuff but because they come during the same appointment they only filled out one completely, which I find sad as I like having proper records at home. I probably will be moving Vets after my kittens are done all their 1st year shots and boosters. In summary there's nothing wrong with their knowledge or treatment of the animals, but I'd like to be somewhere that is also focused on the pet's owner understanding what's going on.]
