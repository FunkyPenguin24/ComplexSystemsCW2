[101912415526078334543,100664449834299348931,I haven't even moved in yet and I want to get out of this place. Don't get me wrong the trailer that we (my spouse and me) are moving into looks really nice and seems to be well taking care of. The big issue is that we were told one thing and when we planned everything dealing with this move around it, they did the complete opposite. Lucky, I have a great extended family here in the area. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone. If you do decide to do business to, make sure you get EVERYTHING in writing that way you are covered.]
