[114555467740844384629,100285083136147282292,At the end of January, my husband and I started renting unit A042 at the SW Denney Road location. He is a service member, so I was coming in his stead with my mother-in-law to move some belongings of his closer to my residence. We were assisted by a woman named Barbara who was by far the least pleasant representative I have ever encountered. I work in retail, so I understand the importance of good customer service. This only made me more appalled by the treatment my mother-in-law and I received when we came in for the first time. We were talked down to almost the entirety of the time we were there, with the exception of the final 10 minutes before she handed us a request to write a nice review for her. I know associates can have bad days, but there is NO exception for the attitude she gave us. My mother-in-law and I both left with our jaws dropped and amazed by what had happened. I have called the location roughly 10 times in the last 2 hours and only received a line busy message or the sound of the call being picked up and hung up. I can not describe how infuriating this is. My lock is stuck on the door and I need to reach someone to find out if someone there can remove it for me so I can move some new items in and replace the lock. This is near impossible to do if I can't reach the location. To top it off, I tried calling the customer service line and every time I try to jump through the hoops to get in contact with someone, it tells me it doesn't recognize the extension and ends the call.]
