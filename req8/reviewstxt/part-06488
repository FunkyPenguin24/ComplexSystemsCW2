[101781028031002570036,100503919317889768392,We went there with my son and our neighbor's daughters... ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!!! Nevertheless, it wasn't bad. Our service was ok with the capacity of patrons, and the children had good access to the games and play area. My only item would be the bathrooms. Clean them often, or have a guy monitoring because it was a pig sty there... Other than that, an alright experience.]
