[108821134271633595882,100486580558938928722,Danny Atienza has been someone we've gone to for cars for over 15 years. Not saying we haven't purchased other brands, but over 80% of our purchases with cars have been with Honda and that's mainly because of Danny. He has been honest and respectful of our time, money and choice. He is never shy to tell us not to take the deal if he thought the deal will hurt us long term. Besides, Danny has been so good that he does not wait outside for customers. Long time clients look for Danny inside the building. That tells you A LOT. Our family bought a Honda Odyssey in Oct 2012, another Odysse in Nov 2012, Pilot in Feb 2013, a Civic in June 2013, and an Insight in Oct 2013]
