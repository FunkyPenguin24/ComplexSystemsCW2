[112151760103894826147,100167766346392230347,He is an exceptional photographer. His workmanship and dedication to achieving perfection is admirable. I was pleased with his work and the quality of his end product. I received full sessions for our engagement and our wedding. I also received a beautiful engagement album and a beautiful wedding album. Currently still working with him and so far he has completed my work in a timely matter. He is very flexible with appointments and will meet with you multiple times. Additionally it is very easy and fun to work with him. During our event, he took many photos, but also being considerate and allowing my wife and I to enjoy our wedding. He took all the right photos and captured some very special moments. Thank you Miguel for your work.]
