[105471854232947934286,100803305343198215468,This hotel was AMAZING! Not only was it VERY easy to find and close to the airport, but the staff was helpful, the rooms were beautiful, breakfast AND dinner were all delicious, and we couldn't have asked for a better hotel to stay at! Breakfasts are nice and hot - we had eggs, hash, hashbrowns, sausage, bacon, waffles, etc. Dinners (which are served Monday - Thursday) were really good, too! My husband especially liked the free Bud Light! :) Our teenage kids really appreciated the pool table and we, as a family, had a great time with the Giant Jenga game we checked out from the front desk - they also have a basketball court (you can check out a basketball), ladder ball, bean bag toss, footballs, and soccer balls. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with two bathrooms, a living room, and a full kitchen. One night we grilled chicken out on the grills (which are beautiful and available for guests to use) and ran out of time to wash the dished up afterwards. When we got back to the room later that day, everything was clean and washed up for us - dishwasher running. :) It was amazing! We've talked to other people that stayed in other hotels for the Marine Corp graduation ceremony and they couldn't believe our hotel offered all the things they offered - they all wish they had stayed in our hotel! I HIGHLY recommend this hotel! We can't wait to go on vacation again so we can stay in these hotels again!]
