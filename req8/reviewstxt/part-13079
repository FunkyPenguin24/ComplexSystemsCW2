[116588275881935886428,100861616555590055261,We have used Sydney Pet Resort for numerous daycare and long term stays since the beginning of 2012. After viewing a few places which had the dogs kept in tiny 4 walls and concrete floor kennels with no where to play for 80% of their stay, there was no way we would let our dog stay anywhere else. It is a true 'resort' for the animals. At no time is Izzy kept in a cage. She has free run of a huge paddock with dogs her own size and at night she gets to cuddle up with them securely inside. The staff are amazing and as a new dog owner, have always been helpful, friendly and passing on advice and knowledge. I only wish that there were more places available for animals to be looked after in this environment.]
