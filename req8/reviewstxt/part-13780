[107130468906530041963,100899924790167259973,I have typically had good experiences with Enterprise, but this was by far the least professional branch I've been to. We arrived 30 minutes after our reserved time and they had rented out our car! The only other available vehicle was in a different class, which they insisted on charging us more to rent though we were still within our grace period. Though the agent who ended up helping us was friendly, the other was downright rude and kept us waiting 10 minutes without so much as an "one moment, folks." When we did finally get the car, it smelled of cigarettes and had obviously not been cleaned since its last rental. They charged us $7/day for an additional driver (I didn't know ANYONE still did that) and never let us know. We got a total for our estimated bill, but didn't see an itemized receipt until after we'd returned the car, at which point I recognized the charge. Needless to say, we will not be returning to THAT branch and possible will not use Enterprise again in the future.]
