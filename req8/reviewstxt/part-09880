[112399199279104009124,100686841050084928144,Being in the military you travel a lot, I am from the old country and this is the first bakery that you can say it is original. I have experienced flavors from Mexican bakeries in Colorado, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California but never have truly tasted a better bread like the one that is baked at this place. Over 70 and love my bread, so I honestly can say this is the closest, if not the real thing to a Mexican Bakery.]
