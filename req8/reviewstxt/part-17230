[108552165117002587434,101088525688149126942,I had a deep cut on my hand on Saturday and went to First Choice ER to determine if stitches were needed. The staff was very helpful and no waiting time at all. The total time to in and out was less than 45 minutes and the up most care was given. The location is perfect those living in Wylie and Murphy area that cannot drive to Garland to the hospital.]
