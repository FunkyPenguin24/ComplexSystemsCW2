[104721464629719973630,100707844029659361178,My little sister’s wedding was coming up, and I wanted something really special that would be glamorous as well as appropriate for the occasion. Though we were not in her wedding party, the bride wanted all her sisters to dazzle, and I knew exactly who to call – Bridal Styles Boutique! Elaine was so wonderful! We talked about what I was wearing, my style, my sister’s wedding, and her wedding look (Elaine and Edward designed her veil and headpieces too). What she and Edward created exceeded anything I had imagined. I’ve never worn anything so gorgeous in my hair. I felt so beautiful! Thank you, Bridal Styles, for my incredible sparkly hair flower. It added just the right amount of magic to my little black dress!]
