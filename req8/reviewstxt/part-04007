[100943138943773247593,100370032251445918515,I had heard good things about this place and after having tried it a few times I have to say I'm kinda disappointed. The Vaca Frita was extremely dry, almost to the point of being inedible. I might go back to try the walk-up window because everything I saw there looked really good but aside from that I doubt I'll be eating here again.]
