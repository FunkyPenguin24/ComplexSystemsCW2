Those of you who simply drink water should be able to identify with the problems we encounter. You are lucky to get a refill. If you aren't buying drinks, you pretty much have to choke down your food. The water glass is as small as you can imagine. When the waitress finally returned to our table to ask if we wanted desert, she failed to notice that not only had we drank what little water we had been served, we had also chewed the ice for moisture. Sorry but there is no excuse for this. Leave us a pitcher if you have too many tables to deal with.]
