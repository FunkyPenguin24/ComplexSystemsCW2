[110390754369528622146,101063813088677896640,Everyone at PHIA is so qualified, and their haircuts are fantastic. They have you sign a paper outlining your services before starting any work. At first, I was a little put off by this, as I had never done that at other salons. I discovered how nice it was to know the amount due before getting to the cash register. I have used a few different stylists there, and they are all very nice. They will work within your budget, be sure to ask about options. For example, I get my hair colored by a trainee (less expensive), but my cuts by a master stylist. My color is the same every time, so why pay the higher fee? Everyone I've worked with there really knows their stuff. When my male friends get their hair cut at PHIA, I notice a difference. Parking in the Short North can be a challenge, but it is easier with the Hubbard Garage open. I recommend PHIA and Aveda salons to all my friends looking for a new stylist.]
