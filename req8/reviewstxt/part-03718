[111770344490025001060,100354013789573538574,Restoration is a dynamic church focused on building relationships and growing as a part of the Arlington community. My wife and I attend church here because of the friendly staff, encouraging community members, and the connection the church has to multiple active outreach organizations in and around Arlington. One important note for people thinking about visiting: The location of our church meetings are at Little Falls Presbyterian Church at 5pm on Sunday for a short time because the address listed here is going to be the home to our new church building.]
