[101556708901720673008,100874262840346792654,I must admit when I first thought about this place being a "medical spa" I thought it would be like sitting in a doctors office. NOT SO! This place is AMAZING! Very comfortable and pleasing to the eye. See for yourself by clicking "See Inside". From the time you first walk in you're greeted by a warm and friendly staff. From check in to check out they use the latest cutting edge technology to make sure you are well taken care of. And I have to say that if you haven't met Dr. Dickerson you're missing out. He's extremely knowledgeable and a great person all around. Just stop in and introduce yourself you'll see what I mean. Cape Fear Aesthetics also has great events every week that are entertaining yet educational. This is a top notch Med Spa for sure....check it out!]
