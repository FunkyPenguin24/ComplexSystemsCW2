[108862702971735282349,100734789432688447840,One of my FAVORITE lunch spots. Also one of the few Chinese restaurants that have lamb. The lamb and basil lunch special is fantastic, as is the Cantonese fried noodles (not sure if that is the correct name for the crispy noodle dish that i also get). Definitely a must try if you 've never eaten there....... Oh .... great soups too!]
