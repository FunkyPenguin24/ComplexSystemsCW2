[102008472779417468540,100402925452013077816,Service with a piece of indifference. The calamari meal I had was over spiced and dry, and the spices were sandy. I ate half then left it as a waste of a meal but there was no interest in the fact my plate still had food on it. When I said the chili was too much, there was no room for any other flavour, and the spices were gritty, I was told other people like it and no-one else has complained, and that is the way it should be. I said it needed a dressing of some kind to marry the textures together and was told it was fine as it was. No interest, couldnt wait to get the plate off the table and be gone. Service varies; some staff are good but there are a couple of who seem marginally annoyed at having to serve.]
