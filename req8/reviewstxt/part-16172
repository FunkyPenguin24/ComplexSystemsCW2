[117484113362032441743,101030281917445119498,Went to 2 CVSes and physical exam office to try to get a flu shot but none had it available. Finally went to Central Health Center and there was no line, very clean & FREE! Staff were very friendly and I'm more than satisfied about this experience. Highly recommended!]
