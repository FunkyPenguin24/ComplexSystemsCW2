[106582878249859125539,100716385626433740421,One of the best burger joints in Panama. Their specialties are awesome, I prefer the Japanese Swiss and the Three Amigos, but you can custom make your own burger with whatever ingredients you want. They also have a Burger Challenge which is free if you eat a burger with 3lbs of meat in under 20 minutes.]
