[100078342000945594596,100646420854298284932,Nice location, average food. We were not very impressed. I understand the food would be a bit more expensive given it is by the beach, but I imagined it would be on par with the V&A. However, the food was dry and not very tasty. Harbour House in V&A is much better.]
