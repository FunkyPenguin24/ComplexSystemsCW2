[105504226579082609374,100478350037099361948,I brought a new girlfriend here and it was so romantic with the sun going down over the sea and marsh. The staff were relaxed, but attentive, confident, friendly and accommodating. I was surprised in a positive way when the bill came, so left a generous, tip, which was totally justified. The food, which appeared to be simple and uncomplicated had lots of subtle touches and was cooked to perfection (my steak was spot on and with the Red peppercorns in the sause/garnish made the dish interesting and exciting to the palette). Thank you for helping the date to go well, I am very impressed and "we'll be back" as Arnie would say.]
