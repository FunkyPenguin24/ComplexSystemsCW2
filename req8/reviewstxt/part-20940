[118259478921160859939,100109534839717467305,Our Big Ben - large shepherd/lab mix - lost a back foot to cancer, and we didn't want to see his quality of life diminished. My husband found OrthoPets online and recommended that our vet surgeon help us fit Bennie for the prosthetic. The vet loved it and videotaped him using it to show it to other families. Bennie was able to continue his long walks, and we were glad to have him able to use all four of his legs. The videotaping and casting system worked well in fitting him - even from Atlanta - and we really liked working with the staff at OrthoPets. If you are looking to extend the quality of your pet's life with a prosthetic, we suggest you contact this company. They're terrific!]
