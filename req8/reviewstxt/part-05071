[107757111793998180780,100427107592141997571,I dropped of a 05 Ford Focus that had never seen any cleaning beyond the 2x a year trip through the auto car wash. I did not have high hopes for the car but wanted it to look nice since it is now my regular driver. I went for the full detail and got more than I expected. The car has 120k miles on it but now looks BETTER than the day I drove it home from the dealer 7 years ago. My wife and I were completely in shock at how good the car turned out. The seats look like brand new and all the small scratches acquired over the years disappeared! Why did I wait so long before having a full detail!?! In addition to the top notch detail work, Jim or his partner were some of the nicest people I have ever met. Very personable, honest and answered the phone when I called! I plan on going back to Jim quarterly from now on to have my cars washed and waxed. Maybe a yearly full detail to keeps things looking as god as new! Book an appointment today. You will not be disappointed!]
