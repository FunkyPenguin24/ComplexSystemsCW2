[104884736666649445510,101027164298747947252,My nails were pretty torn up through cleaning from my move. I wanted my acrylic nails soaked off and a new set put back on. Unfortunately water had gotten under my nails while I was cleaning and caused a fungus to start. I had no clue until the nail tech Kent showed it to me on two different nails. I asked him if it would grow out and he said to make sure and come back in two weeks and he'll check it. After further research, nail fungus does not go away without treatment and everything I've seen says you MUST take the nails off for the healing process to even begin. He did not put on fresh tips like I requested but used my existing natural nails. Add to that the fact he continued to work on my nails with his normal equipment and made no attempt to sanitize it knowing I had a fungus on two nails. $50 I was charged for this and I left him an $7 tip because the nails did look beautiful. This looks like a clean shop when you walk in but they do not sanitize their equipment and will take your money rather than protect the health of your nails. I don't care if this was the last salon in this city, I wouldn't go back.]
