[109487201686492992685,100201492842556022619,I pulled up on friday Jan 3rd a230 pm. I was immediately engaged (attacked) by Brian. I mentioned that I was starting to look at cars, and would like to buy one within the next 2-3 months. When asked which car I was interested, I told him....the corvette stingray. His first words to me were: "What, you want to buy one?" (as he looked me up and down). seriously? --no i was there to steal one-- anyways there was one in the show room which he claimed he could not open because it was "sold" then I asked to see another one...he stated that they were all sold. I asked why were they listed on the website if they were not in fact available. He then told me me that they sell quick. I did mention that I was in awe of their ability to sell 6 cars priced over 65K in 5 business hours as I had checked the stock at 11pm the night before and he simply shrugged. I then asked about the national corvette museum delivery program to which he stated did not exist (fyi it does....just google it) any how, then a manger (leonard) came by and showed me a corvette but stressed I can't sit in it because it was sold....(i guess i am too dirty). at the end as i left dejected that i had wasted 45 minuted of my life i saw another car i was interested in ( a 45th anniversary camaro) and asked brian the price....he told me he would text me, (never did) i am not sure what they didn't like about me...my clothes, my car, my questions, or my race...but i went to courtesy the next day and was treated with respect. I can't recommend Van Chevrolet.]
