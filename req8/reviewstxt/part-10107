[102212055710928132347,100699824521943136665,I recieved one great shellac mani from one of the nail techs at 4 tip to toe. Every other service I have had here was terrible. There is a huge language barrier and if you do not know exactly what you want, you will likely have trouble communicating that to them. Customer service is very poor. I recommend you find another salon.]
