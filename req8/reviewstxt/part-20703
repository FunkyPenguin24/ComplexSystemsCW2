[109571020503668549123,100097103446345380228,After some time trying to figure out how to pull a water tube thru a water dispenser hole on a newer fridge I was fixing, I stopped over at Robbinsdale Ace to ask the staff for a suggestion. The manager was most helpful matching up the tube diameter and a long screw. Using the $0.15 screw as a lever, I was able to pull the factory water tube into the required position. Thank you!]
