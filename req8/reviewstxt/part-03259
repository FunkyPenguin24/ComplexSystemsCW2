[104581827372935898845,100327152852446655185,I live directly next door to an Edwards Theatre. We go to Majestic in Meridian because they just have a more local feel, its a great facility, kept clean. BUT I mainly go for the FREE popcorn seasonings they always leave out about 8 different fantastic flavors. Every other theatre in the state charges $2 or $3 for a little tiny shake or two of seasoning. This theatre is generous! love love love]
