[110646867275791336681,100717272182028965159,I never even got the chance to become a customer of Drexel due to its horrid customer service and response. I emailed for two days to no response and called nearly a dozen times over the course of two days to a busy signal each time. At this point, I had given up on the company -- imagine a landlord that won't answer their phone or email for two days! Finally, I was able to get through on the phone, and a gentleman rudely informed me that I had to call a different number to get a hold of "Pete." The number rang all the way through and went to a voice mailbox for someone who was not "Pete." At this point, I once again decided to stop trying to contact the company. On the third day since first trying to contact Drexel, I got a call from an agent who told me that I needed to call "Pete" again, and gave me a different number. I called Pete who was clearly not happy to receive my call and informed me that he wasn't going to be able to show any apartments in my available time frame. I explained that I have been trying to get an appointment set up for three days, to which the man had no response and simply told me to call back at another time.]
