[102986749016883397979,100935632902941540037,Been going to Paul's now since 2000 and have never had a bad experience with its employees. However, having worked retail since that same year, I can tell you that there are those customers who are asking for help as soon as they come through the door. Their time is too valuable to waste it looking for something, so they want to be escorted around the store like royalty. I've even had customers call me on the phone with a list of stuff they wanted put in a shopping cart so they could wheel it to the cashier when they arrive. I find these negative reviews over-the-top and embellished by spoiled brats. If you don't like Paul's go to Wal-Mart and shop with the other clones.]
