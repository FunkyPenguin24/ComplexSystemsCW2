[103423048671470261447,100701733278327765817,There is a reason why Car Zone gets great reviews. Murph is awesome. On multiple occasions he has saved me hundreds if not thousands of dollars. One example - my car was making weird noises - took it to a dealership and they told me my water pump was about to go and I needed to get it fixed asap and it would run me around $1,200. Took it to Murph and he told me the water pump was fine and fixed the car for a lot cheaper. It runs better than ever and 20,000 miles later no problems with the water pump. I won't take my car anywhere else.]
