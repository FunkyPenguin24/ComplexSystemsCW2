[103366285603675623667,100942310366028810423,I found A & A lock service via a google search last week for a locksmith in the Clarksville area and called them. I scheduled an appointment, met Roger and his wife at the house the next day. They were on time, professional and very effiicient. He changed all the locks in my house to fit ONE key in less than ONE hour. I was very happy to have this done for a price less than what it would have cost to buy the locks at Lowe's and replace them myself (and they would not all have the same key either!). I highly recommend this team!]
