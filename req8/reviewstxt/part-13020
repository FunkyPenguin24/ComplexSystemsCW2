[110372161379993737495,100858060777627308030,If you want to be harassed and treated like crap this is the place to go. Stay away from preditory salesman. I had the worst experience here. I was actually sexually harassed and sexually taken advantage of! Yes I was abused by the salesman in the back lot, where my vehicle was parked. I have filed charges against the salesperson and am suing the dealership in civil court. Please if your female, DO NOT GO HERE ALONE! They are sleezy men, The only two people who were professional were RUDY and BJ. In my communcations with the owner, he was unwilling to help me and did not return my calls. I Hope that after the law sit we can get these creeps out of Burien FOR EVER!!]
