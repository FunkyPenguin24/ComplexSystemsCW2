[105683103843201545847,100676699181433214810,Takoba has long been one of favorite East Side eateries, but lately it's popularity has kept me away. I love the variety of drinks- it's hard to find a good caipirinha in Austin! And most likely if you're here on the weekend, you'll have to spend some time at the bar before there's a table ready for you. Check out the chill space behind the restaurant - with firepits and colorful Adirondack chairs to relax beforehand. There's a bar at the back that rarely has a line! As far as food, I love their twist on the el pastor tacos, and their tomato soup with blue cheese is slurp worthy! Great brunch place also with legit mimosas. I'd recommend it but don't show up starving, cause it'll be a while.]
