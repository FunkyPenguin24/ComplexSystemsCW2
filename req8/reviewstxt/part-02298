[103681808127614414498,100277500261084145095,I was having some brake issues so I took my car in to have it looked at. They said I needed 4 new rotors and brake pads, it was all going to be $740. I called my mechanic back home and he could do it for $350. Needless to say I will be driving it home to have it fixed. Th service was fine and I wasn't charged, but you can expect to find much cheaper rates elsewhere.]
