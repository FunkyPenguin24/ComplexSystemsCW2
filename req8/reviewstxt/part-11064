[104253717918363469616,100751345764630884825,My boyfriend, his friend, and I went to the Chesterfield location roughly a week ago. This was, by far, one of the MOST entertaining times I've had at any chain restaurant, all thanks to our favorite waitress, Donna! So let us set the scene a bit. The three of us stroll in, and we were, I suppose the only way I can say it is "greeted," by a less-than-enthused man who had the "end of shift" attitude (you know, where everything is nearly an inconvenience, rushing you to hurry up, etc). My boyfriend immediately gave me the, "let's just leave and go somewhere else" look, but I ignored him, and we took our place in the tables. It was at this point that we were greeted by our amazing waitress, Donna! I, not looking like I was even close to 21, ordered a glass of wine, and she noticed immediately that I am a WI resident originally from my license. She began to make small talk regarding the area. I remember specifically that she "fake-swore," and I immediately told her that we were a light-hearted group and we didn't care in the least. I believe that, from this (as well as the fact that we were poking fun at my boyfriend), she pegged our group right on the dot. Throughout the rest of the course, she joked around with us all, to a point where I was CRYING from laughing so hard!! She was one of the most entertaining waitresses ever. We were so impressed, we left a nice tip as well as a note for her (which I have never done for ANY waitress/waiter before). Overall an INCREDIBLY fun and entertaining time with Donna as our server. I really hope that the next time we go out there that she is working!]
