[103321496148016902149,100466803968752218706,As a Prescott local, this is one local Prescott establishment that I will never visit again. I love the beer at the Prescott Brewing Company. The service has been mediocre at best, unless you set at the bar, Katy is wonderful. Either way the beer has been worth it. My recent visit was during happy hour and the prices were great. I found they offer wings, only during happy hour, at 45 cents each, with a minimum of 5; no problem. I ordered a dozen. I finished six and ordered another lovely pale ale. When I ordered a desert to go, for the fetching Mrs. Sullivan, and asked to have the remaining wings wrapped to go, Katy said, "you can't take them with you"...I thought she was kidding. When the night bartender came on, she confirmed that indeed, I could not take them with me, it was a restaurant policy. WHAT? I paid for them, this is not a buffet, why can I not have them packed to go? Susan, the manager, confirmed that that has been the policy for 19 years and that the owners are unwilling to change this. They would rather throw away good food than let the consumers take it with them. As a Prescott local that visits the PBR two to three times a month, they have lost a customer for life. My entertainment dollars are limited, as are many other families. I can assure you that I will not return to this family owned establishment; that is the most ridicules policy I have heard of in my twenty plus years in the restaurant industry. My advice is to not visit them or to buy their beer in the few locations that offer it. This just goes to show you how a mom and pop establishment can ruin a good thing with goofy policies. There are many other very good pubs within walking distance to the PBR and whisky row in Prescott that I will be visiting with my family.]
