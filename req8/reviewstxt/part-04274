[108831288768786564014,100385724012684669493,I'm pretty ticked off by this place. I've spent at least $100 1-2x a week for the last month and a half. I just left Nisen with another $100 of sushi and asked if they could give me the 20% "customer appreciation discount" coupon that's on their website. I told her I've been renovating my house for the last month and had no printer. Yet, She said, "No, sorry". Well, now your business is sorry because this isn't the first time Nisen has done something that turned me off. So, this girl couldn't give me a 20% off discount because I didn't have a printed out generic coupon from their website? LOL. What a joke! Every time I've gone to pick up an order I've had a problem with the service here. The girls at the front desk are airheads. They are completely clueless about running a restaurant. Obviously they were hired for something other than experience. I had a screaming infant in the car last week and the girls told me my pickup order would be ready in 20 minutes. I ended up waiting with a teething, freaking out baby, in my car for an HOUR.. for pick up! I told them this was happening and they just smiled and spaced out saying, "Oh, I don't know... they must be backed up or something." Uh, the place was not busy. It was maybe 6:30/7 pm on a Wednesday? The sushi? Great.. Although twice, I picked up my order and there was NO SOY SAUCE. That's like picking up a cheeseburger with no ketchup. Not giving me a 20% off coupon when I've been in regularly and have a legit excuse for not having a physical piece of paper on me is just like saying, "I don't give a sh*t about my customers". So Nisen, I don't give a sh*t about giving you my money anymore. Hope the 20% funds you well. =]]
