[101635501920760437364,101068728850400166381,I really liked this place. I'm not to big on tex-Mex but this is definitely a place I would recommend. Even though the kitchen was about to close in 7mins as a group of 9 walked in, they were still very nice and served us before the kitchen closed... That takes skill and patients. Two thumbs all the was up!!!]
