[110318140261298422565,100758313030886546717,I've had nothing but positive experiences with Down Home Guitars since they opened. Steve, Molly, Amanda and the rest of the store staff are friendly, helpful and knowledgeable. The school portion of the business is wonderful, too. My 12-year-old son started taking bass lessons this past summer with Tom Maslowski and absolutely loves it. Tom clearly knows his stuff and is not afraid to hold his students accountable to high standards for practice, but he also has a passion for playing. From the first lesson, my son talked non-stop about how much he loved learning to play bass and how Tom made it fun even when it was hard. That's the sign of a great teacher. Down Home Guitars is right at home in downtown Frankfort, and I'm happy to give them my business.]
