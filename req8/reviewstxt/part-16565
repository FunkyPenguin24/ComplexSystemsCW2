[111253792963160861953,101050858467340088299,The food is excellent at this restaurant. It is an excellent display of culinary arts, a talent that Spain excels at. The name, meaning "the dove" is a thoughtful touch and shows just how personable this place can be. Inside it is very comfortable, not too big or noisy. It is a good place to go to enjoy a dinner with friends or to go out on a date. The price-quality ratio is pretty good, but at times it can be a little pricey. Definitely would go back!]
