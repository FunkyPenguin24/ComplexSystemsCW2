[114430082037592314369,100258992947678561615,I used Attorney Wise for three different closings on my personal home and investment properties. He did a great job, particularly since two of the closing happened simultaneously and it was quite confusing as three loans had to be paid to make it all work. Well, all I can say is that everything went off without a hitch. Robert was very accommodating and even came to my office and worked around my schedule for both closings. His attention to detail is flawless, all the paperwork was to perfection, I received every penny I was due to me, including excess taxes, fees and so on and so forth. Quite to my surprise, Mr. Wise even sent a $75 refund several months later when the bank filed the release and his office didn't have to do it. During all my years in real estate, I've never seen a real estate attorney perform at this level of integrity and follow through. I will be using Mr Wise for all my future real estate closings.]
