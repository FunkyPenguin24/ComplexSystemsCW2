[106295348228971411004,100831895453959346494,I've had a good experience with Metropolis to date. They are friendly and knowledgeable. I've just passed my full bike test with them inside ten days, four days intensive for Module I and a two day course for Module II. I had three different trainers during this time - Chris, Pedro and Mark. Each had a different style but all were helpful, friendly and full of useful information on how to pass. I really couldn't fault them. I've also just purchased a new Honda NC from Sean in sales, he was very helpful in suggesting the right bike for my needs; even kept it to one side for a month whilst I tested. I've been a scooter rider for a year and have used Metropolis service department for oil changes, manufacturers recall and to fit an apron, all completed on time and to a high standard. I suppose the best thing about Metropolis is their massive range of stock and disciplines, it really is a one stop shop for all your biking needs. Don't be put off by a few poor reviews; these guys really know what they're doing.]
