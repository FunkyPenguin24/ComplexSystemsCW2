[107288095320164774171,100045224098799615208,Our family traveled to Playa for Thanksgiving vacation this year (2012). One of the items we had on our list was a dive on Friday morning of our trip. Having obtained my OWD earlier this year I wanted to dive in this area. All of my training dives were in the Raleigh area so this vacation dive was to be a first on a lot of fronts. First ocean dive, first dive off a boat, first deep dive. As might be expected I had a little apprehension about the dive. I signed up at our hotel who connected us with Phantom Divers. From our initial conversations they calmed all my fears. Carlos Estrabeau "Charlie" was fantastic. Positive beyond belief, he walked us through all the details and got us setup in no time. The boat ride out to the site was great but nothing compared to the first dive. It was incredible! Floating along the reef was a great experience. During the time between our first and second dive, Charlie took is to a beach where we experienced a cenote a couple of feet from the shore. Second dive was incredible as well. The big surprise of the day however was the 50+ pictures that Charlie took during the dive. I now have wonderful pictures of my first major dive. These guys are great!]
