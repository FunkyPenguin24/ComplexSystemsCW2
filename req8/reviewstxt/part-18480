[116743223641965204765,101154921973954303873,Worst Strip Club I have ever been to in Chicago. Bouncer at the door tried to be high and mighty and tell us that if you have a party of 10 or more you have to pay $55 per person just to get in the door. We get in and the place is dead and there are two girls working at 9 pm. After a while more girls came on shift but they would sit and the bar as if they were bored and waiting to go on stage. A couple of the girls were actually rude to our guest of honor and pretty damn ugly. Lap dances are a joke as they dont even touch you or dance on you. Please choose a different spot for your special occasion]
