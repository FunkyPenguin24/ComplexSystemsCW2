We were greeted by a humourous waiter who was enthuisastic to serve us. He recommended wines which were excellent for the food we chose. He provided some great suggestions on local food specialties and we appreciated some complementary aperitif at the end of the meal. Service was excellent, food was tasty with good presentation, the setting of the restaraunt had a homely feel. Overall we had a wonderful experience at this restaraunt.]
