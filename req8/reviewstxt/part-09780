[111354840134846411698,100681024949630449668,Dr Goldman is the best. I took my dog some were else for years just recently my baby dog got sick she would not eat so I took her to the other place she was diagnosed with diabetes so I left her there to be treated to the tune of 1500 and when I picked her up she was worse then when she went in. So one of my friends suggested Dr Goldman I made the appointment and took her in well in the short time he had her in his care he and his staff showed so much caring for her and her condition I wish I would have tooken her here first. sadly my baby is no longer with us but I will be taking my other dogs here. for the sheer fact these people care about the animals they treat here. other places are all about how much money they can sqeeze out of you and treat your beloved pet like garbage... not Dr Goldman he is a blessing and a true Vet.... ask your self when it comes to the life of your pet that you love like child would you throw your money away on a vet who only cares about his nice shiny office and his Mercedes or would you go to a place were they give real quality care. I chose Dr Goldman for the Quality care every time.]
