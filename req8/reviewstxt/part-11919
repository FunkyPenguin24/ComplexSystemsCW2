[106256231202822293583,100796504347440898012,I am writing to recommend Artistic Smiles Dentistry. Just yesterday I had my first experience as a patient there and it was truly wonderful. I had a broken/hurt tooth that needed to be fixed right away, so I called Artistic Smiles to see when they could fit me in. They were able to have me come in yesterday right away, and they were able to take X-rays, a 360 degree scan of my mouth, do a root canal on the tooth and put in a crown all in one visit. Dr. Kenneth Khoo did a wonderful job- him and his assistant Stephanie were constantly making sure I was comfortable and keeping me informed of the process. Today I am pain free with a beautiful white crown in my mouth. I have already scheduled my next appointment with them. Thanks Artistic Smiles!]
