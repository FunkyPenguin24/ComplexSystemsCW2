[109386592527866260851,100126054783352583333,I give one star and thats only because it is in a great location to travel the city from because its right next to the Earls Court Tube Station. However, I would never stay here again. The room was tiny and incredibly hot. The only clock in the room was the remote control for the broken air conditioner and the clock was wrong!!! We had no international phone so we asked for a wake up call on our last night and they forgot to call us so we almost missed our cruise. Terrible service and clueless front desk....]
