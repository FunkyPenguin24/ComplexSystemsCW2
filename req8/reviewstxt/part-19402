[105297651146517370963,100027612903592970902,There are two things in life that most people dread - going to the dentist and taxes. Well I can honestly say that Pete from P&G Accounting has "almost" removed my fear of taxes. He's been doing our taxes now for 4 years and is amazing. He's professional, efficient, knowledgeable and timely. Before going to Pete, we'd put off doing our taxes as long as possible, now we schedule the appointment knowing that we are in good hands and that we will get the best outcome possible. We feel very confident with the service that he provides and always recommend him to others. Pete is the ultimate "TAX GUY".]
