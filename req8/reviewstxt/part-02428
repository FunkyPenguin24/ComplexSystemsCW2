[104247432919071850509,100284195253179893224,Very enjoyable car buying experience. We spent a considerable amount of time researching cars and prices. We visited Toyota of Naperville early in the process. When the day came to make our purchase we were confident of what we wanted and what we wanted to pay. We contact several Toyota dealerships and with most got the usual car salesman nonsense. There was none of that at Toyota of Naperville. They were very upfront and the price they quoted us at was significantly lower than what we had researched and expected to pay.]
