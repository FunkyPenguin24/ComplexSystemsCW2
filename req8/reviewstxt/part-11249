[107645828921598636831,100761081082610462585,The terrible service here is legendary. Watch out for the automatic 18% gratuities added to the checks. After a very long wait, our food finally started coming out in spurts. By the time the last plate made it to the table, our burgers and fries were stone cold. I was never offered a refill of my tea, so I had to choke the big, cold bun down dry. When a server is aware that a patron is unhappy with the service, it is unconscionable to force an 18% tip.]
