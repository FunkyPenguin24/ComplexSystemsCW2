[115248092243094530361,100664045979579743402,In Lovejoy's Tea Room, I was a queen, a very queer queen, but I queen indeed. I felt pampered and royal and got to eat teeny tiny sandwiches and scones along with fancy tea. Tables reserved for Queens, Kings and, all Royalty were appropriate, though some of my servants felt left out and I would ask for a separate table for peasants. Though, all in all, I thoroughly enjoyed this fine eatery.]
