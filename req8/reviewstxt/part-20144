[106082239132595199815,100067932813679194642,Small "Mom & Pop" type pharmacy. I was new to the area and decided to try these guys out when a Big Name pharmacy up the street was out of my medication. I have to pay for my prescriptions out of pocket so I am always concerned with price. This place turned out to have a lower price on my medicine than anywhere I've ever filled it! (Although they do accept all regular insurance that any big pharmacies accept, I did ask that.) And they filled it on the spot and had me out the door in less than 10 minutes! There's not much else to the store besides the pharmacy, just a few shelves of basic over-the -counter meds, but I will continue to fill my prescriptions here. There's nothing high tech or fancy here (I don't think they even store their data on a computer), but it seems like a good, old-fashioned family business of the type that are quickly becoming extinct. I would highly recommend using this pharmacy.]
