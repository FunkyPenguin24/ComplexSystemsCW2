At the time I wasn't planning on changing my phone but the employee was so good to me. He pointed out that my phone would stop working soon and If I did change my phone I would have better service everywhere I go. He wasn't lying! I love it! I would always go back to that place! He loved him and the place!!!! I always tell my friends about it :D]
