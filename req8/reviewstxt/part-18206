[101074128592080378044,101141018782119155440,Three generations of my family attend UUCA. My mother is a long-time member, and I joined when we moved back to Orange County last year. My teenage daughters also attend. I'm not at all a "churchy" person, but the UU principles speak to me, and the congregation is friendly and welcoming. If you are looking for a liberal faith community and care deeply about social equality and justice, I'd highly recommend you come check it out! We'd love to see you!]
