[109588331357189801510,100924123349901263771,On a layover I found this ace through Google maps. It was hop fest and I got two flights of beer. The bartenders were very knowledgeable and thee was plenty of room at the bar. It was a friendly place and I enjoyed my Reuben, although I'd probably get the Cuban next trip. It looked incredible. My only critique is that I'd like a pint of Bert next time instead of a flight. I'll be back.]
