[105501614487164951413,100889408070039331518,Reasonably inexpensive compared to other places in the area. That being said, there communication is horrible. Not only to the customer, but between themselves. Very difficult to make an appointment. They were supposed to come quarterly, though I guess 3 months is too long to remember such things. Once, did not show up to an appointment, then left a message for me saying that I wasn't there. Frustrated, I am now willing to pay more for better service.]
