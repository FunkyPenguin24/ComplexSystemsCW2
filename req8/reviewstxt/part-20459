[114417067315869228626,100084186413150710235,went through the drive thru, painfully slow. ordered 6 chicken nuggets for myself, a fish burger for the wife and a hot dog for our 5 year old son, and an order of fries and gravy. My Chicken nuggets were over cooked , how do you screw up nuggets? our sons hot dog also over cooked and gross, I never seen this boy not finish a hot dog until today. The wives fish burger looked so gross and was truly inedible. this was truly the worst restaurant experience we have ever had. would never ever go back to this dump ever]
