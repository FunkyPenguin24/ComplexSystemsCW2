[116967006329704797083,100237965895555844358,We asked people who were eating food from Barb's how it was, and they told us it was great. They said they were locals, and they ate there all the time. One of them must have been Barb. We assumed the fish would be fresh, since the place was sitting right on the water. We weren't sure about the calamari, though, so we asked the employee (who asked a supervisor) if it was fresh. He told us, "We freeze ALL of our fish, or it goes bad within a day." That should have been our first hint. Unless they don't have a refrigerator, fish does NOT go bad within a day. We get FRESH fish shipped to Albuquerque (in the desert), and it commands a higher price than frozen fish, because it's better. The food was pricey, which we could have understood, since it's right on the water in a tourist trap. But the food was hardly edible. The breading on everything was pale and tasteless, and not crispy at all. The halibut, for which we paid a premium price over the cod, was mushy and flavorless. The calamari was *extremely* rubbery, even though its breading seemed undercooked. The sauce served with it didn't help the flavor any. We couldn't find anything to season the food, but as we were leaving we saw that there was salt, pepper, and vinegar at some tables. I wish we had known so we could have added some flavor to the food. The only food that tasted good at all was the french fries, and I rated the decor as good because we ate outside by the water. The place itself was just a walk-up food stand. We paid $43.75 (American) for food for 2 people, and I wish we could have gotten our money back. I can't remember being so unhappy about a food purchase. At least we didn't end up sick.]
