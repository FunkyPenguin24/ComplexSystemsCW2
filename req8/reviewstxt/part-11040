[116246444152126769340,100750177286007595342,I can't say enough about thses guys!! Took my Sebring up to them after hearing an awful sound in my brake area. Come to find out that my brake calipers replaced by another company were not tightened down and were basically flopping around in my wheel. It was under warranty with the other company but Christian Bros. did not feel comfortable with me taking it down there, neither did I. They are only charging for the two bolts ($15) and are going to make sure I am safe. I recommend using these guys for all your vehicle maintenance needs!!]
