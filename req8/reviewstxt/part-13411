[113540575724499118854,100880119800857837819,We tried the carne asada tacos, ham and cheese torta, and milanesa torta. You definitely get more for you dollar with the torta. The tacos were small and came with no fixings. The taste was pretty good, especially the milanesa. They served a side of beans that I found too salty. I wasn't happy with the service. There were no smiles. It took a long time to get our food, and the order was not complete. We ordered baked potatoes but were given beans. Though I liked most of the food when we went, it seems like a place where quality may vary day to day. I have no regrets dining there, but will not likely visit again.]
