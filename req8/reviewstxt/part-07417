[102327104378303310724,100555621937362111044,The worst buying experience I have ever had. Salesperson was okay. Finance department is a bunch of idiots. I have a masters in finance, they gave me my monthly payment and tried the once over by charging me a higher APR than stated. I said this payment is too high for given level of APR, they recalculated and voila! fifty dollars less a month. What a bunch of cheats. Then, they put +$2000 on my principal on my loan... ummmm?? What the heck is going on here? Still isn't resolved, rude people at the dealership, no accountability, will never do business with them again or any Toyota dealership for that matter.]
