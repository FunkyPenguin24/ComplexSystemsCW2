[103812723766731675839,100987425245758561825,The guy who runs the place doesn't like to help his customers with cancellations if needed. He sent us back through Priceline. If you're going to use Priceline to accept reservations, you should, as a business owner, know how to deal with cancellations. This guy's behavior was completely unacceptable. When he realized I was not going to back down from my request, he hung up on me. I then had to call Priceline, whose representatives were EXTREMELY helpful, and they called the guy and basically forced him to accept the cancellation. SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME and book a room elsewhere.]
