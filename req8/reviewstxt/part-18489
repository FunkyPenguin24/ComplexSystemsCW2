[105997894033894516884,101155345363647319994,Great Service there, it was my first time going and immediately the lady there was very help. Assisting me with which size washer I should use, how much I should in the dry (cause not all dryer are the same, from my experience), and all this service without me even asking for it. Now I don't know if everyone is as friend as the person there that they, but she did make the experience a whole lot better. Their was a small inconveince, ppl were retiling the floors, which is also a good thing.]
