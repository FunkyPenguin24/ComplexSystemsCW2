[110118266084368214511,100160673721004765463,Divas is a great place to go for straight people as well as their advertised gay/lesbian crowd. There is always a mix here, but they are very friendly so as a curvy goddess I don't feel self conscious dancing here :). Their drinks can be expensive but they usually have specials like $3 jello shots. The themes they come up with are pretty cool, check their fb and website for info. While the inside does look a bit run-down it's not anything you notice once the lights are down and music up. Great outdoor smoking/cooling off area. Recommend for girl's night out, birthdays.]
