[106938228690968690048,100532491373038398329,Our second visit to Comedy Carnival at the Grand in Clapham (nicely opposite Clapham Junction Station). My wife and I love the Grand as a building, great architecture and have fond memries of seeing the late Jeff Healey in concert there around 19 years ago. What a good deal, the ticket price (some (Â£17.00) gives you a format that includes 3 top comedians, plus comic compere. Seating is all relatively close to the stage, so even though the venue is spacious you get the required air of intimacy that all good comedy venues thrive on. It gets better, the staff are all nice and the drinks are cheap in terms of standard London prices. The wines are decent, it just goes on........ Things to moan about. well you buy 'Reserved seats' on line and then you cant reserve your seats, someone does it for you. Sure enough we were front row and just off centre, right in the 'Line of fire'. In our 50's my wife and I were the oldest people in the venue. I can't help that, I grew up in comedy clubs just as the wave of talent that brought us Jo Brand, Paul Merson, Jack Dee et al was breaking and I love comedy as an art form. Still we were given a bit of stick for being oldies. That was no problem, but I think reserved seating should let you choose roughly where you want to be. Still it was a great night with the talent on show really up to spec. After enduring 1.5 hours of suffering with the ticket master website and customer service I now hopefully have tickets for the 16th March, my sons 18th Birthday night out. He's a comedy addict, where else will I take him? Keep up the good work Gary]
