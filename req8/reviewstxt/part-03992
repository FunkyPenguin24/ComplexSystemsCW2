[105941758251479820401,100369069615012654073,My visit started out with a very simple coversation on the phone with the Office assistant. She quickly scheduled me when it was convenient for me and emaile me forms that I could fill out in advanced along with a confirmation email on my appointment. This told me that they were up to date with technology. Then when I arrived, I was greeted and assisted very kindly and the waiting area was very clean, modern, and comfortable. They explained everything that was about to go on with my appointment very clearly. Once I was in my appointment, I enjoyed the up to date room with tv's on the ceiling, mostly the caring and friendly Dental Hygentist and Dentist himelf. All very kind and full of compliments. I felt so comfortable and like I oculd talk to them about anything with no rush and that they really cared. What a great place! I was so happy when I left there and look forward to my next clenaing!]
