[110047558479685688492,100953091592800241363,I would like to whole-heartedly thank Kevin Sale and the entire financing crew at Encinitas Ford for all of their help in getting me into my 2013 Ford Fiesta SE this week! They worked fervently and relentlessly to get me the absolute best deal even when faced with some pretty tough financing challenges. Instead of giving up and telling me they could not help me, they went above and beyond and made sure that I left the lot with the best car for my needs and with the best possible deal I could get. I am thrilled with my new car, and eternally grateful for everything these people did to help me. I strongly encourage anyone and everyone who is in the market for a new or pre-owned car to talk to Kevin Sale at Encinitas Ford before you go anywhere else.]
