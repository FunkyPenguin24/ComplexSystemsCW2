[106396956146160230053,100171657761721322396,If I were to describe the sales service we received, I would say it was slow but overall I was happy. However, when a new van blows a tire in the first month or two for no explained reason and Koon's and Toyota's response is that they didn't sell us the tire, they only sold us the car and it was essentially tough luck for us, you can bet that the $300 tire fix cost them a whole lot more than that when it comes to future purchases. So, my suggestion to everyone out there is that if you want a dealer who stands behind their product, stay far away from Koons Tysons Toyota.]
