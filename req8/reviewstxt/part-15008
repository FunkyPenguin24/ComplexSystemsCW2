[108019380063682231710,100967436309269215582,Don't let the decor turn you away. The food was absolutely delicious, everything was fresh. The bread was lightly oiled and served with dipping oil. The tortellini soup was served in a broth that could stand on it's own for texture and flavor, the spinach and egg in the soup was a perfect blend. The house salad was fresh, chopped perfectly and the house dressing was delicious. The entrees were perfect. We both decided on seafood pastas, different pasta, sauces spiced differently. Both were excellent. I can't wait to go back.]
