[111108558219887786995,101120777888793202245,I cannot think of one negative thing to say about Briar Rose. The people are always friendly. Everything I've every tried has been delicious. Pastries and baked goods, delicious. Sandwiches and soups at lunch, delicious. Saturday night pizza, delicious. If you're going there for the first time do not leave without having a cinnamon roll, they are so good it's like Angels are frolicking on your taste buds.]
