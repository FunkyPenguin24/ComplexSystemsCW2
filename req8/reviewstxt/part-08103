[100224233769793284934,100593271914765925866,Pizza is great! Loved it. Got onions for the first time and thought it was amazing and I don't usually like onions. That could be a good or bad thing for those of you who do. Takes quite a while to get your food out but it's a good place to eat if you are ever in Hawthorne.]
