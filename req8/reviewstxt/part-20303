[110980723784515144054,100076553673583746963,I have been coming to this restaurant for years. There is no other Thai restaurant in this city, which even comes close to the authenticity of the food they serve. The Yam Nua is ridiculous!!! On Friday afternoons during buffet, you will be lucky to find a parking space, or a seat. The staff are very attentive, and the cooks don't mess around when it comes to heat. You want the real deal, eat here...you want "white people Thai"...go elsewhere. I guarantee you'll crave this place on a regular basis once you give it a try.]
