[109632837453126150047,100801800308554583791,Great little place in the middle of a beautiful historic market town. Stayed here not too long ago after a wedding nearby and would definitely recommend it. Great food, inside of the hotel was extremely well kept and tidy. Also have to give it a 5* service as the people were so friendly. Great location for walks around Knaresborough too!]
