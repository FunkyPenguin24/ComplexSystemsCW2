[104955323124645197640,100625519715225780413,I had a sound coming from my 2010 Traverse. I took the car to my local Chevy dealer. They originally diagnosed it as a rear differential, but after picking the car up, the sound was still there. I had them reassess and was told a new list of problems costing $2400. I then decided to go for a second opinion at Don Larson. The Don Larson price was $500 less and I decided to go with them. As Kevin was going through the information on the computer, he remarked that we had Zurich service plan and that I would only be responsible for the $100 deductible. I was sheepishly surprised needless to say that I didn't remember we included that plan when we bought the car. I was treated with respect and will definitely bring my car repair needs to them- even though it is a half hour drive. Great people!]
