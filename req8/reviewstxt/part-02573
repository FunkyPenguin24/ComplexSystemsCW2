[106188428497435052952,100291181634178160958,Please disregard Google's description that this is a Used Car Dealer. This is NOT a used car dealership, this is an Automotive Mechanic, where you take your cars for repairs. I'm cross posting my Yelp review here to provide this place with some extra visibility. I received a recommendation for Dixon from a few coworkers who had known him for a long time, and I'm glad I took their advice. Dixon was very professional and knowledgeable. He was formerly a mechanic at a dealership since the late 80's, but started his own shop a few years ago. My vehicle was having an intermittent problem (which turned out to be a fuel pump) and he took the time necessary to figure out the root cause of the issue rather than taking expensive guesses. He took the time to explain to me exactly what was going wrong and his process for diagnosis. He was able to get me a discount off of the retail price for the part, and his billing for the labor was extremely reasonable. Dixon will be my go-to mechanic from now on, and I'm happy to say that I've finally found a mechanic in the Athens area which I can unreservedly recommend.]
