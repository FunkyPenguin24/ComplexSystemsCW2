[102197828691623936041,100698900275913928970,Service was fast, people friendly and nice. My issue was with the food. I had the shrimp pad tai, with the shrimp being an extra (almost) $3. I got a grand total of three full pieces of shrimp and the pad tai didn't taste like pad tai, but a lot more like a heated up frozen dinner. It was terrible. One extra star for the service and friendly atmosphere, nothing else for poor food and over pricing. I paid $8, which is at least double what it was worth.]
