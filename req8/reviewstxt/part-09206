[113299372547535050631,100649997167306524232,Cathy teaches other lawyers across the country how to file bankruptcy. I highly recommend her. You can't do better. She has trained a number of other attorneys how to properly file bankruptcy and how to defend foreclosure cases. She has always proven she cares. I have been providing bankruptcy seminars to other lawyers as well for Lorman and NBI. Cathy has consistently been professional, patient and compassionate in all the years that I have followed her as another NACBA member and trainer. I don’t often recommend other attorneys because we all compete for clients. But I can’t recommend her highly enough.]
