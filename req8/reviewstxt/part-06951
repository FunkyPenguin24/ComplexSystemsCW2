[109575199105980975769,100530650978226422895,I went to Antelope Canyon in 1991 before it became a Navaho main tourist attraction. I was in Page and someone told us to go see it we were directed in, it was amazingly beautiful and I have my own photographs of it. More recently we wanted to go but it was $15 p.p. to go in and we didnt want to pay. So I have my happy memories and photographs. It felt very spiritual.]
