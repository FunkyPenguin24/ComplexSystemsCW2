[108574916465185395133,100840263991162318781,My computer's power supply fried my mobo so I went there to buy new ones. First time they sold me a bad PSU, it happens. Brought it back, they exchanged it, np. So I open up the mobo and sure enough, it's not the right one. They put the wrong mobo in the box. So now I'm return trip number two. So I put it all together, and sure enough, AGAIN nothing works. The mobo is broken. My god, do they sell anything not broken? I asked for a return and at least they gave me that. I bought my items of newegg, installed them, they work flawlessly. To add insult to injury when I mentioned the part being broke they said they would test them there. I was like "oh neat!" But then they said they would charge $40. Hold the phone. They want to charge me money to test their parts because THEIR stuff is broken. That's messed up. Better off with newegg.]
