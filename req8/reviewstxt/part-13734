[102463451069173176170,100897845958196169532,LOVE..Love...love this dentist office. My son has been going there since he was an infant and now he is 4. My daughter just started going to him, and I would not have it any other way. The staff is great, and Dr. Edwards is patient, and engages in the kids so that it is a calmly experience for them.]
