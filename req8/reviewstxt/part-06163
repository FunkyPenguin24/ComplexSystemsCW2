[108563203172106216525,100486040052225231443,Have been eating here at least twice weekly for about 3 yrs. They're open from around 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. for breakfast and lunch. Food is great...just like Mom used to make! They have meat dishes, full range of vegetables, salads and great sandwiches. Their specials are very reasonable, from $5 to $8 for lunch. Great coffee, good pies, if all you want is a coffee break. Very friendly owner-couple are always there to cheer you up and make sure the servers are taking care of you. Atmosphere is great...walls full of collectibles from the 40's to 60's. Easy to find, easy to park, no long waits on food. You can't beet it on quality food on a budget!]
