[107093667333337928885,100805957496445028382,I am currently receiving treatment with the inman aligner with Dr Safa at the Care Dental Practise. I was really nervous about having a brace, but Dr Safa has been AMAZING throughout the process. She is friendly, efficient, kind and really puts me at ease. Most importantly though she is an exceptional orthodontist and I like her so much that she is now my dentist too. The treatment is working really well and i am really pleased with the results so far. I highly recommend it to anybody wanting to get their teeth straightened. The rest of the staff at the practice are friendly efficient and helpful. I cannot recommend the Care Dental Practise strongly enough.]
