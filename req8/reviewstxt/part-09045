[101173804622246819110,100641461030019596489,Wife ordered over the phone. The person taking the order wrote down the wrong thing (I don't know how you mix up "Beef and broccoli" and "Steak and Shrimp" which is what we wanted), then hostess insisted that that's what we ordered over the phone, and was going to charge us to wait while they corrected "our" mistake. Terrible customer service, Ok food, recommend avoiding it. It will be the last time we purchase from them.]
