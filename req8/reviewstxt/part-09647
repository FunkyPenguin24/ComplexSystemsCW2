[113537558691051575180,100674289298734385918,Want to say Carson Toyota was top notch!!! I was working with a great employee of Carson Toyota,his name was Nathan, I drove approx 300 miles from the Central Valley and it was wayyy worth the drive. Nathan saved me about 200 a month compared to dealers here in Fresno, even got a moonroof and entune at no extra charge..Process took only around 30 minutes to complete transaction!! I will only buy or lease my future cars from Carson Toyota in the future...]
