[103292181477047524841,101094346552615980811,My experience with Dr. Smith and his office staff was excellent. I was referred by a family friend and from the moment I made my appointment to the conclusion of my visit, I couldn't have been more pleased. The friendly receptionist worked with my tough schedule to fit me in and since I was coming from North San Diego County, I appreciated her flexibility with my appointment. Dr. Smith's office was easy to find and pleasantly appointed. My procedure was smooth and handled professionally in less than an hour. Dr. Smith was friendly and approachable and his bedside manner was exemplary. My results were wonderful. I will continue to visit Dr. Smith and have no hesitation in referring future patients to him. Thank you for a great experience! Kristina - Carlsbad, CA]
