[110859154430392410988,100433673107836594505,I've had some sketchy experiences with dealerships in the past and was hesitant to turn to one for a vehicle. After some extensive research, however, I narrowed down a selection of a couple that I felt I would buy from if a decent car turned up. Fortunately for me, a car turned up on Boucher's website so we stopped in. The sales staff was incredibly friendly without being overbearing. While I expected a price inflation, I came away with the Ford Explorer we looked at for a price I can respect. A nice touch was the general manager coming out to meet us before we left and telling us a little about the car (as it was bought and cared for throughout it's lifetime). Would absolutely buy my next car from Boucher Ford!]
