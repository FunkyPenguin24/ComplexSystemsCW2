[112470041351561836984,100650936791161464911,The staff is excellent. They always greet me kindly. The office runs like a well-oiled machine. Listen to all instructions and ask all questions up front. The full healing time is about 6-8 weeks, meaning the clearest vision. Be prepared for that. I definitely do not regret having this procedure done with these professionals. The cost is reasonable compared with other places but you are also paying for the years of experience that Drs. Dello Russo have. Get yourself the free consultation at least. You won't regret it.]
