[107676920562502370165,100108631021715193314,If you are in the need of VERY BASIC chinese food done well come here. The food is done well, but don't come expecting variety. On several occaisons I've tried to ordered healthier options such as vegetable white rice, or brown rice, and they don't have that. I've tried to take out the alter my order with something simple such as taking peanuts out of my kung pao (because they OVER LOADED IT with nuts the last time I ordered it. I'm talking 60% nuts to 40% everything else) and they simply overloaded it with celery. These guys are ALRIGHT depending on what you order, but if you attempt to order something different or healthy with a good food ratio? Don't think about it. But if you just want a good plate of General Tao with some fried rice, go ahead they are good for it.]
