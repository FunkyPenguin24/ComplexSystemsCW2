[108555139183771267454,100985493653379994489,Truly a horrible experience. I walked in with the plan on buying a car THAT DAY. I dealt with a salesman, gave him the models I was interested in and my price range. They found a car they thought I would like, took me to a satellite lot, and the car wasn't there. So I perused and found a car that I truly wanted to buy. After being told that I was being "rigid" about pricing and options, despite the full disclosure about my interests and limitations in the purchase, I chose to take a night to consider it. Came back the next day with the decision to buy the car EVEN ABOVE what I had planned on spending, and have been going through hoops ever since. After 3 days worth of 3-5 hours sitting in the dealership and empty promises about actually getting the car in my possession, I am now sitting stranded at work, without the car being delivered as-promised. Strike 3, you're out. I would NOT recommend ANYONE using this dealership, unless you are a glutton for punishment.]
