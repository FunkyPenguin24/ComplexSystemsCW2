[109560756623682614722,100362494403516015527,To be honest with you I spent money with this store in the past and They always have attitudes ,They make you wait long time to buy a freaking GAME.I swear Sometimes It feels like I'm at a Insurance company or a Bank. If you call they lie to you to get you off the phone.If you wanna trade a game or sell it, they give you nothing and turn around and sell it for 40 bucks to someone else .If you support these Jokes and that Business you are stupid.Because The game stop and other companies sell used games alot cheaper and with better store credit .GAME dude your over rated ,I hope you go bankrupt ,Punk a$$ establishment]
