[113808023004487126455,100818918340617381478,My wife and I spent our first anniversary here almost four years ago. When the staff learned this they seemed to roll out the red carpet for us. There was an ice storm that night and because we couldn't leave until it finished the staff had all of us who were stranded there watch a documentary by Ben Stein. Great faith-building materials here too!]
