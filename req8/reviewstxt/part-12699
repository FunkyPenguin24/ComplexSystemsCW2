[110645733260339234529,100840189772119694976,I bought a 2008 BMW 528xi from Dave this past summer. Dave's knowledge of the various vehicles we discussed targeting to purchase, and his ability to locate the one that we landed on, was impressive. He really believes in providing a full service and personalized package. Dave was able to get me an extended warranty, which gave me peace of mind. The car itself was in mint condition and I love it. The price he sold it to me at was as good or better than all of the same cars that I researched on the internet. Dave will work hard to find you a great car at a great price. This takes a lot of the effort and stress out of the used car buying process for you, so I urge you to give him a try!]
