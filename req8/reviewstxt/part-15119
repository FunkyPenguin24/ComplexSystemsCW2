[107249310258544698679,100973094676029430102,Being new to Texas I was fearful that we'd never find a school we loved as much as ours back home in Florida. I was so very wrong. I love The Children's Courtyard! They are very kind and patient and the teachers really seem to care about what they do - it's not "just a job" to them. My boys are learning so very much and I'm thankful every day that I decided to stop in to have a look when we moved here.]
