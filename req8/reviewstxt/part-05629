I am embarrassed to say I passed out, that aside I was told that the man caught me by cupping the back of my head, gently set me down so I didn't hurt myself and after making sure I was alive he finished my piercing. When I woke up he joked with me and told me it has happened to him before and it was nothing to be embarrassed about. Super amazing, if I wanted anything else done I would go here.]
