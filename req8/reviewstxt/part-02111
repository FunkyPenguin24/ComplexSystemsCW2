[109783660818324552429,100268301426140598952,I began visiting the Blue Grill in Milford about a year ago. A few revisits over the past year haven't dampened my enthusiasm for the food here. Both the beef and chicken shawarma remain excellent. Ask for the garlic sauce, some tomatoes, cucumbers and onions and along with the rice and lettuce, you have a meal that will fill you up and put a smile on your face. The hummus tastes homemade and a mile better than the stuff you can purchase at the stores. I simply have never had a bad meal here. Now, the downside. I used to frequent this place when it was Stucchi's Ice Cream. The wood floor gleamed and was spotless. Since it's been the Blue Grill I'll be they haven't actually cleaned the floor (other than sweeping it) once. The back entry way floors are also obviously dirty, dirty, dirty as are the floors in the main dining area. The sill under the windows had dead flies and the bin for plastic bottles was overflowing. This place has great food. What it needs now is management to put some of the employees to work cleaning and keeping the place up because the cleanliness of this is really beginning to put me off.]
