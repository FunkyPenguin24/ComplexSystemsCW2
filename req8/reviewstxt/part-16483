[100309106617483242815,101046133605485366919,Michele Rose has opened my eyes to the wonderful world of slow cadence training. As a former soccer player, I was very conscious and methodical about my training, and now that I am a busy professional working a corporate job, I don't have time to work out like I used to, let alone think about what I should be doing in my workouts. Michele and 20 Minutes to Fitness take care of all of that for me, so all I have to do is show up and give me best effort. After only a few weeks, I am noticing and feeling a big boost in my energy and ability to constantly be burning calories. I would recommend exploring this type of exercise, particularly for people with busy schedules like me...it literally takes just 20 minutes once a week!]
