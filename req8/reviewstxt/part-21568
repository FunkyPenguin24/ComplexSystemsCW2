[101103835664787175105,100143603788444557418,The worst experience of my moms life. Phoned Knights plumbing and heating about furnace broke down. Its minus 35 outside. Tech showed up inspected the furnace said it needs both motors replaced so he replaced both and the furnace still did not work, said he would have to get a new switch and left for the day with no heat. My mother is 68 years old. Returned the next day and said he could not find the switch but taped together the old one and said everything should work. Well the house got back up to temp and when the furnace shot off it never restarted. charged her $506 dollars. When she phoned back to say it was not working they would not even pick up the phone. Phoned a new company and they said she needed a new furnace and Knight should of informed her of this. Very bad business practice.]
