[100351940326822077158,100709593703859261679,The best thing about Cool Al's is that you are not paying for ambiance, just awesome food. Every time I go I get a different burger and have always walked out thoroughly satisfied. Expect a wait of at least 20 minutes since they hand-make your patty when ordered, especially if you have it stuffed with bacon, peppers, etc.]
