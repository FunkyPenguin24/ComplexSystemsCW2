[107543095474199586651,101166559968363695400,I purchased a groupon for Detail Kings for an exterior and interior detail. I called to schedule an appointment with them and came in two days later. The entire process ran very smoothly. I dropped off my car, went shopping at Oak Brook for two hours, and received a phone call when they were finished. When I came to pick up my car, I was very impressed and my car felt like brand new. The employees are very professional and organized. I will definitely be back! Thank you again for your service!]
