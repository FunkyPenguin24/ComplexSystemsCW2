[100028105475427726851,100284885731728066560,Went to Hula Hut for a late dinner and was not particularly impressed by this lauded establishment. The service was at best average with only a single serving of chips + salsa being delivered to our table despite the original serving being devoured in minutes. I got the Fajita Beef Pipeline Enchilada, which was also average as far as enchiladas go. The cheese sauce was pretty tasty though. Just as a tip for our waitress: Don't tell someone that they can't order the shrimp quesadilla without cilantro because it's prepared ahead of time and is therefore only available as listed or with only shrimp + cheese. No one wants to hear that food is pre-made.]
