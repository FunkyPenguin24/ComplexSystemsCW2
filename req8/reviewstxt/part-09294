[113233889431926023888,100655040336028091143,We had our Daughter's First Birthday here on March 1st 2014. We took "Mandap" for about 100 people. Loved the hall and ambiance. We spoke to a gentleman named Ashok. He was very accommodating and professional. We were little skeptical about food based on previous reviews. But Ashok has assured us that food will be good. All our guests loved the food. Most of the halls got chandeliers, decorated walls and a nice stage. We cant ask for anything more. We ended up finishing our party within our budget without compromising on anything. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend. Thanks again Mr.Ashok. We will come back to Royal Alberts Palace for our next party!]
