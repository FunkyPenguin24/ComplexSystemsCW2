[114321899723810703399,100211890719824571802,The PANDORA Store BEWARE -- of this store and its legit appearance!!! NOT a Authentic/ Original Pandora Store, it is PRIVATELY owned (3rd Party Authorized retailer/ Franchise - as describe by Pandora Corporate Office) SCAMMER of their 30 day return Policy.. My husband purchased $300 worth of charms as a Surprise gift for me (which I already had purchased at JARED) When he tried to return the items a few days later (because I already had the same charms) he was dismissed and told that the items had already been used. I later returned to Politely explained and showed the Store manager that I already had then charms. Store Manager (Jossie Nunez) was abrupt and rude would not even hear me out. She lacks Customer Service Skills, conducts herself VERY unprofessional, and uses slurs in Spanish about the customer. BUT Thank God for American Express!!! They were able to dispute our charges. This store just LOST a Pandora Obsessed customer. Please buy at JARED, No return Hassles!]
