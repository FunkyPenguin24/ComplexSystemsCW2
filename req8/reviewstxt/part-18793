[104133377343803439240,101172342058121198725,WOW! Is all I have to say. Pedro Marriquon has done it again. This is the best Chick Fil A I have ate at in the Dallas / Fort Worth area, and I've ate at almost everyone of them. The service is like a 5 Star ***** restaurant, and the food just as tasting as Double Diamond food. When you go there to eat Make sure you ask for Pedro and Frida his wife and say hi to one of the most amazing, kind hearted, humble professional in the restaurant industry.
