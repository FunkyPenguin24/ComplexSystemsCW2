[108868305246857201391,100422117169931950834,Jason and Gene were easy to work with. They gave a fair value for our trade (higher than trade value on KBB) and also gave a fair price on our new Acadia. Finance didn't push us when we said we didn't want any of the add-on's. Will return for service and will post another review at that time. Overall a good dealership that offers good pricing.]
