[101489533936309545001,100252769723510174621,I used chipsaway for the dent removal service they offer, On my vehicle was a dent 7 inches long most dent removal companies i was quoted from were telling me it needed to be filled and painted which i was not happy with at a cost of £350,I went to chipsaway and was told no need for painting and was quoted £70+vat which i accepted and booked the car in ,I was blown away with the results you could not tell the dent was ever there,i have sent friends and family to chipsaway and everyone has been happy with there quality and results.i would 100% recommend.]
