[106298178214889638137,100864572060782774757,We have stayed at quite a few properties on the Monterey Bay Peninsula including the famed Pebble Beach Hotel; however, The Portola Hotel and Spa is by far our favorite. We love walking into the tree lit lobby. The atmosphere is so warm and welcoming. The Staff caters to your every whim. The concierge, Ann, is a wealth of information; any event, restaurant, etc... You name it, she can direct you. We love getting a nice warm baked cookie upon arrival after driving... Just an extra nice touch. The rooms have a nautical flair which is so apropos as the view is overlooking the wharf and the yacht harbor. The beds are divine in fact we asked the management where to purchase them. The bathrooms are spacious with all the modern conveniences. We have celebrated my birthday and Christmas 2 years in a row. The restaurant in the hotel, Jack's, is fabulous with dark woods and throne like booths which reminds me of San Francisco. The food is absolutely wonderful to say the least. It is prepared to perfection. The restaurant features an enclosed glass paned dining room which is where we have celebrated my birthday and Christmas. On Friday nights you can taste wines from various different wineries compliments of the hotel. One of the best places to enjoy the wine at the hotel is sitting around the outside fire pit. During the holiday season, there is an outdoor ice skating rink where skaters can enjoy the festivities. What more could you ask for? In fact we are going back this weekend to celebrate my birthday again. The Portola is the best!]
