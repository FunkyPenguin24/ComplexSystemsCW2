When he was old enough for us to go out, it was the first place we wanted to go, as we were craving some California Eggs Benedict. Something was amidst when we showed up and there was no wait. The place was practically empty. Then I noticed the bakery counter was gone. Regardless, we stayed and ordered. I got my usual-- cappuccino and California Eggs Benedict. The cappuccino came in a cup that was half the normal size. Additionally, my Eggs Benedict was overcooked. The egg yoke was completely cooked through. Lastly, the breakfast potatoes was unseasoned. Hate to say it, but we will not be going back. What a shame!!!]
