[105025719728814893855,100046418043149960706,Fantastic place full of Magic brings me back to my childhood wonder. Only drawback for me is 1: Then entrance fee is very high but worth it for the magic wish they would average it out yearly fee is affordable but they make it up in the daily so people visiting from afar pick up the bulk of fees. 2: Is brought on by events in the world today. Having to deal with security moving between parks is a pain I wish they would have a closed system where you could move freely without having to go through security each time you wander between parks. Even with these drawbacks the most magical place on earth a place everyone should visit at least once. As for me visited 2 weeks ago and ready to go back.]
