[110004604138266758347,100082593884868820868,Paris is a true professional, I recently had some work on a 3/4 sleeve done before I moved across the country to LA. It was my second visit to him and I would not go anywhere else in Charlotte. He has such a talent. He did freehand work on my side and on my sleeve. I promised him that I would not let anyone else out here finish what he has started. I will be flying back around the holidays to get the sleeve finished up. That is the level of respect I have for his artwork and skill. Do yourself a favor and if you want the best tattoo artist in town go check him out. Side note: I have been tattooed by artist all across the state of NC and various parts of the country and have never been more pleased with a tattoo.]
