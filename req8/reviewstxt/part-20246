[109856039198795433604,100072704730644740788,I am always so shocked when I see this place get any kind of good review for absolutely anything. I did read a ton of bad reviews on the service at this place but I figured we'd try it anyway. I met up with some girlfriends (I'm signed in under my husband's account) for a girl's night out. We each showed up with a bottle of wine each, clearly showing we were in no hurry. The waitress gave us no intro, no "Hi. Welcome..." Nothing. Just a "what can I get you?" She was short with us, no smile...it was as if we were actually bothering her by requesting to be waited upon. Her service was bad, her attitude was worse. And this is the overall attitude of all the servers. After bad food and bad service she brought us over one large check, never even asked if we wanted it split, even though it was clear we were on a gal's night out and would probably need a split check. Since she barely ever returned to our table after tossing down our subpar meals I asked another waitress passing by if she could notify our waitress that we needed split checks. Her eyebrows went up and a look of "Oh I can't wait to see how this turns out!" came across her face as she said "Oh I'll tell her" with a lick of snide. The waitress came back over and without a word tossed down our checks. I had enough. I said to her "Is there a problem?" She said no. I said "Well it's as if you're having a hard time waiting on us. As if we're bothering you in some way." She just said "No. I don't know what you're talking about." Well we women did so for 4 checks totaling over $200 she got a $0 tip and at least 4 women that will never return to this establishment. Even if the food was outstanding I might be able to swallow poor service but the food was so bland and so bad. Pittsburgh has so many awesome restaurants definitely save your money and go elsewhere.]
