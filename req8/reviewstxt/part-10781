[100010901410627834394,100735349209043676679,Threw medicine at my sick cat, over 4 visits in a month to try and resolve his eye issues. Cost me over 1000 dollars. Charged me 40 dollars for a used container of an amino acid which costs 10 dollars online. Every time I asked a question I felt like I was being talked down to. We eventually went to a specialist who diagnosed it correctly the first time, got us the right medicine and got our cat healthy. Her staff is helpful and delightful though which is nice. The Dr. is crook though, and took advantage of my love for my cat.]
