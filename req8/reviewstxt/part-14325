[100293081389774675557,100930135486023696233,My two poodle mixes (Tweek and Trinket) have been getting groomed by Elizabeth for almost a year now. She does a great job and my dogs really like her. The best part about it is the dogs are groomed at home and don't have to wait around in a cage making it an extremely comfortable situation for the mutts! I think the other review about a man was meant for someone else because she is the only person that we've dealt with.]
