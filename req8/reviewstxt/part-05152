[108744521881729249382,100431688275116544094,From both sides of the table, me being an infantryman / infantry instructor in the Marine Corps for years, and my fiance being against guns in the house this class was a great experience. I enjoyed seeing Andy ground the absolute need for safety around firearms, and I heard on the ride back to the house "So...that's why you are always talking about safety rules." It was a learning experience for us both, and now we are both for having as much protection as we can. I would feel comfortable sending anyone I know, no matter their background with firearms, to Andy and trust that they would walk away more comfortable, and much more educated about guns and the correct way to use them. Thank you for an awesome class!]
