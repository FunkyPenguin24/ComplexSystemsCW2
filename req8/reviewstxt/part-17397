[103286822732670520078,101097268922535967312,I have problem with my Mazda3 Navigation control unit, googled and found Edward around my area to see if he could repair it. Drove to his place and he was very professional, friendly and inspected the unit on the spot w microscope to find any potential problems! He told me he'd clean up the unit to see if it fix it for FREE!!!! A couple of hours later he had the unit all cleaned out! Granted, it still didn't resolve my original problem which could be the nav itself but I trust Edward for his professional service, honesty, generousity for any electronic services in the future. Thank you again Edward! Kevin]
