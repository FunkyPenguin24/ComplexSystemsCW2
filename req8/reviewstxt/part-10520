[109901660195593840655,100721316727699495554,For my birthday I wanted to try out something different, so I reserved Shoot Indoors for myself and my friends. A lot of the girls were a little nervous before we started because they had never shot before, but Shoot Indoors was great in giving us an excellent safety tutorial. The tutorial was to the point but informative and I didn't feel that my time was wasted at all. Brian and the rest of the staff were also walking around giving pointers and making sure everything was working well with the guns. After maybe a couple rounds all of the girls were hooked. They LOVED it. So much in fact that a bunch of them set up a girls outing to come back. The place is brand new, the guns that they rent are high quality, and the prices are excellent for what you get. They were able to accommodate over 25 of my friends with no problem. It's just a cool place to hang out and I will most certainly be coming back.]
