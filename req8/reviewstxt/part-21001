However, The movers worked slow(i was taking items down as well and made at least two trips to their one), damaged furniture and the claims department does not respond to emails or calls. I WOULD NOT recommend this company. Upon finally getting in touch with the claims department they told me to send via certified mail a couple of documents. I did so which cost me $12.50 to mail and was never contacted by the company. I also left multiple messages both voice and email and never received a response. The claim is still open and has never been resolved and I don't anticipate it ever being resolved based on the poor customer service they have displayed.]
