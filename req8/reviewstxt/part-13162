[108605512610599552012,100866177810208646807,Frank and his staff are amazing!!! We hosted our parents 50th anniversary party @ Cappuccino recently and everything was perfect, not one glitch! Serving 100 guests simultaneously and in a timely manner is difficult, Cappuccino made it look easy. We had a wonderful day with family and friends, we actually visited and enjoyed our event because Cappuccino handled everything from start to finish-Menu (wonderful choices), Bar service, even the cake plus an additional dessert. Thank you again Frank!!!]
