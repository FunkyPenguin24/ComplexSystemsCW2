[103786512091355790091,100293057440902214437,Worst dental experience ever. Sent my husband for a cleaning. 2 hours later, he comes home- no cleaning, and a "recommendation" for $4000 worth of work. They do not clean your teeth at your first visit- regardless of how much you beg. Scammers- don't go!]
