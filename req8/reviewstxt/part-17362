[112370615538445292478,101095594833530951826,Positive notes: the place is clean and generally comfortable. The staff seem to be working very hard to make sure things are taken care of and pleasant. They have many discounts and coupons for the adjacent casino and shows. Negative notes: We were put in a room with an awful view and awoken at 4am to noise from a steam roller resurfacing the asphalt on the road outside the room. Refrigerator ice maker is broken along with other amenities. Considering how far in advance that we arranged this trip, I'm very upset about the room location. There is also an undertone throughout of sales for the timeshare which I don't care for.]
