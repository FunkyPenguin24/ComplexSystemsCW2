[100027533003103188672,101071968230237821441,I had only a short time to learn to drive, and am a late learner ( 32 years old ). Thanks to Doug I passed first time, with only 31 hours under my belt. Booking lessons, was a simple, uncomplicated affair, and Doug gave me plenty of advice on the process of passing my test, not just on how to drive. Always helpful, always on time, always patient. What more can I say?]
