[102372435028389511351,100722748876105882149,In reference to Kaylee's bad review: I have been to this store and have been helped by Kaylee a few times. She has gone out of her way to help me with my vehicle and has replaced the bulb on a head light for me and also switched out my battery. I have found her to be knowledgable and professional. I am wondering if maybe the nasty reviewer was having a bad day and took it out on the folks that work there.]
