[101484055975098438889,100072237082362867950,Professional, friendly staff. Offered numerous auditions for highly paid work. Won several auditions. Made a lot of money. As in, 10 times the amount I paid for my photo shoot. Jobs sometimes take up to three months to be paid, as the process is, Rosey's clients wait until they are paid before they pay Rosey's. The talent gets paid last. We were told that at interview and during the one day training course. I found Rosey's was a great way to build confidence and experience. Rosey's has been a great pathway for me to get started in the industry. The work requires skill and a great attitude. If you don't have what you need, do consider part-time acting and presenter courses. This approach helped me ten-fold.]
