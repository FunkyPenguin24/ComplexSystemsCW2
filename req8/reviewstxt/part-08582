First he could not get the register to work for another customer and had to rely on a clerk from a different store who was in the building at the time. Then he could not complete my order even though the other clerk had been helping me and knew how to do it. He insisted on getting involved, however, and messed things up rather than helping. I won't go back to that store.]
