[101141450457984576577,101143744591863060902,I just moved out of Century Arbor Place after living there for two years. The office staff were friendly and courteous. Emergency work orders were taken care of that day and other work orders within a couple of days. The one time in two years that they took a week or two to get me my microwave that had broken, they gave me a break on late rent which saved me $100. Parking is never a problem, my apartment was quiet and nice. When I did move out, I was smart enough to ask to be there for inspection and got charged for nothing (although my apartment was in great shape). Overall this is a dedicated complex where the staff make it their duty to help you out and I never felt like an annoyance. I went in their office maybe 15 times in two years and they knew me by my first name. I recommend them highly!]
