[106508308333093812426,100451130210941969067,A friendly restaurant for horse steak Tartar and other horse related food. It is a small restaurant located in the heart of Belgrade near the Vukov spomenik park. It consists of a charming yard, open in season and a etno-stable like interior. The staff consists of two brothers(owners sons I think) and two cooks, the atmosphere is very hospitable and private. Since most of the tables are arranged like stable boxes it is very private, there are a few tables on the first floor that are even more private. They do not work on Sunday, as per Serbian custom. The food :-) The main dish here is steak Tartar made from fresh horse steak, its made in french style-5 ingredients. The restaurant and this dish were praised several times in Serbian newspapers and on Monde and some other EU newspapers. One dish is ok for two people(especially if one is a girl) Besides tartar stake there is a regular horse stake, beef stake, homemade Serbian horse sausages and pate, and some other dishes, the menu is not big but all the things I ate were great. There is a nice selection of regional vines(Serbian, Montenegrin, Macedonian etc) and the vine of the house is ok also. Every day there are a few homemade sweets, usually traditional-baklava, urmasice, fruit cake or similar. The prices are average for Belgrade and for 20-25 euros two people can eat. I go there often, hope you enjoy and if it is winter time ask for the Horseman's salad! Beware the pepers, prepared in Serbian way- in oil with garlic are HOT :-)]
