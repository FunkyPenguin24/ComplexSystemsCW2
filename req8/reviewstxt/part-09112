[100771319292248294237,100645192147647472138,I'm in my sixth month with CrossFit NYC and am overall very happy. Pros: * CrossFit has definitely changed me for the better in many ways * I am really happy with the quality of coaching -- my coach knows my strengths and weaknesses * The gym has a zillion classes a day, which is convenient Cons: * The classes can get very crowded, which is not only a hassle, but can also mean you don't get much coaching * You need to book multiple days in advance if you want to go right before work or after work * The showers are ok-ish, but the women's room gets like a jungle sauna]
