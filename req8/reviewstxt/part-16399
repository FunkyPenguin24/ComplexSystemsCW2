[108460068555537399843,101041962575784996590,Looking for a self defense place? Look no further - wait - actually DO look further. You will see that the class availability doesn't even come close to that of SSKM. I have been a member here for about 7-8 months. TRX? Battle Ropes? Cardio Bag? Etc. These are not only included in the price, but not limited to once a week like some places. And if you are like me - somewhat intimidated by this type of thing - DON'T be. This place has a very family like atmosphere. Tons and tons of encouragement and support from the staff AND the students. You go at your own pace and learn a no-joke method of defending yourself. This isn't hard. No real memory or holds or moves. Natural reactions translated into defense and counter strike moves. YOU WILL LOVE IT!]
