[114323992786075022783,100225071779072072774,complete garbage. I spent over $1100 on furniture and paid the $150 delivery fee. 3rd party delivery company sends two thugs to my home, who do not take off their shoes in a brand new home, put huge marks on my wall going upstairs, and then refuse to remove all boxes and packaging like the delivery agreement states. They say there is no room on the truck for boxes... hmmm, you just removed two boxes, put two empty ones back. Called store and complained and after getting irate, they are sending someone to pick up the boxes. Absolute garbage. Will never recommend them to anyone.]
