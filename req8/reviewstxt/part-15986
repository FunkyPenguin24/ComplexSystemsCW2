[101425107803746932033,101020010236572837692,I have a hard time believing that the family that operates this place yells at customers. My family and I have been picking pizza up from here for yeeeeeaaars and have never had a problem or seen one take place! The pizza is great and is more than your moneys worth. As for the service, maybe they just know me too well!]
