[104258807279683473204,100735016648623674498,How can i put this in a nice way? Oh i can't. This place sucks in more ways then you can imagine. The customer service is from hell, prices on cigars are through roof. They have more no name brand cigars then premium cigars. They try to pass off the no name brand as a premium cigar. I don't know who owns this place, but you need better in customer service and get better product. For crying out loud you're in downtown Naperville!]
