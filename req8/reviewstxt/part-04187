[100133674794364591288,100380777305842938929,This place was one of the few restaurants that is centrally located that was available on Saturday night. We tried getting a table at a few other places before we settled for dinner at the Red Viking. The decor is hideous and the buffet looked like it had been sitting there all day. We opted to order from the menu. The items we ordered included: chicken dinner, weinerschnitzel, combination danish dinner of sausage and meatballs, ans the fried pastry treat. The food was better than we anticipated based on decoe and service but overall a poor experience. Portions were a little small for the price. Waitress not at all knowledgeable of menu and beer selection. Will not visit again and will try a wine bar or make reservations at a different place.]
