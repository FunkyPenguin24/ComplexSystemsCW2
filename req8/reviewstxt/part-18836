[111678065962205745124,101174472286488180401,I bought my 2012 Chrysler 200 convertible from this great place. Bill, Glenn and the rest of the staff made my purchase a great one. They gave me top dollar for my trade in and terrific financing on my new car. It didn't take long at all to buy the car. From start to finish, less then 2 hours. Thank you Magussen's Toyota for making my experiance a great one! I will highly recommend them to all of my family and friends!]
