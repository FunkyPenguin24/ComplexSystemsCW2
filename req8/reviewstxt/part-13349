[102026566575971936734,100876109331490158617,I'm not even a patient of Dr. Chisholm, but when I was on family vacation in Ontario, I called him because my frames broke. They had no problem with it, and scheduled me immediately to get in a get it taken care of. They got me in the next day and repaired them on the spot, no questions asked. Dr. Chisholm has a beautiful office, and if he treats all his patients like he treated me, I will have to move to Ontario!!]
