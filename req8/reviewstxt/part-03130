[109870071414473417724,100321240581735556412,Their clinic is clean, calm and safe. I just finished my treatment plan and very satisfied. They did what they felt was best for me, not what I wanted to hear. Most times if you arrive early you get earlier. They are wonderful with kids, and never lecture you on oral hygiene. They listen to what you want, they look deep down, and do what is best for you. If I moved on the other side of Calgary, I would make the drive to see them. They do payment plans, and work with you, rather than taking all your money up front. Talking with the dentist is like talking to a friend...and they actually care how your day is going. Most of all, my kids like going there and they are 11,8 and 3 1\2. This is a great place to go. Give it a try and see for yourself.]
