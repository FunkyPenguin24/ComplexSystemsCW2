[117894052951176079858,100257883416290094683,Ira couldn't have made leasing my wife's new Lexus RX350 any easier. Initially I worked numbers on the phone with Joe who was very pleasant and then we went in the next day to test drive the vehicle and Danielle helped us (Weds is Joe's day off) Danielle was terrific and my wife felt at ease with her which was great because she hates buying cars. Needless to say she loved the RX350 and we arranged for a 11:30am Friday delivery. On Friday we arrived early and we were greeted bye Nigel the General Sales Manager who was responsible for putting together and honoring all the numbers sight unseen on our trade, he is very nice and runs a gorgeous store. This was a no nonsense car buying experience just a straight forward honest transaction. Bob the F&I manager was also terrific he didn't try to shove a warranty or paint sealant down our throats but explained the benefits of both, a true professional. Delivery was prompt and before we new it we were off enjoying the Lexus. I will be looking to in the very near future to switching around a few other cars and being a BMW guy would have never considered Lexus until now. Thank you IRA for an excellent experience Sincerely, Craig & Maria Johnson]
