[105198098813604822128,100044751886142950526,this record store is what i picture heaven looking like.huge selection, fantastic place for both essential albums and rare finds at fair prices. very knowledgeable and friendly staff. a must for any music lover. only drawback is no public restroom, so just like those family roadtrips, make sure you take care of it before you leave home, because it'll be awhile before you get the chance again.]
