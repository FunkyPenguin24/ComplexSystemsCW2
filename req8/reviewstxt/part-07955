[114540622154361985231,100584890113273950739,I've been a repeat offender on The Grapeline and have never had less than an amaze-balls time. It's not about the wineries or the wine, although let's be honest - that's why I've taken wine tours to begin with. The reason I ride with these guys is because of the hosts who take care of you, make sure you have water, get you a spot at the counter on busy weekends & if you're really special, hook you up with the good stuff. From the time you make the reservation to the time you get back home, these guys have bent over backwards to make your day fun. I've taken other tours in the valley and have only re-ridden with The Grapeline. There's just no comparison.]
