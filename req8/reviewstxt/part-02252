[110679936925493173500,100275607762224533301,In my opinion this is the best Thai resaturant in Charlotte. They have great food and great service. My wife and I eat here weekly. We always enjoy the food, and the service. Our favorite items are, Fresh Basil rolls with tofu, Pad Kaprow, Masaman Curry, Vegetarian Delight, and Pad Prik. I encourage anyone that likes Thai food to try this place out, I also encourage you to go beyond the Pad Thai, there are so many good items on their menu. Everything is always fresh and delicious. Thanks to Brooks, Melissa, Maria, and Femy for providing such good service!]
