[110824545553667617355,100258585584859068039,I have been going to this group since I moved to Memphis 27 years ago. I have followed them through 3 or 4 different office moves and will continue to do so. It is a family not a sterile office environment. They care about their patients and I have a specific family doctor but have NO problem going to anyone on the staff if my doctor is not available. I actually had to go in today without an appointment because I had an attack of some sort at work and was told to go to my doctor immediately. I just walked in and they worked me in within 30 minutes and took such good care of me. They have the best Nurse practioners in the entire city. I am just as comfortable with them as I am with my own doctor. Sometimes I actually prefer them. LOL There are many offices located all over Memphis so no matter what area you live in, you can find an office. KUDOS TO THE WOODALLS FOR MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE A CARING AND CAPABLE STAFF FOR US!!]
