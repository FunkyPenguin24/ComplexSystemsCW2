[103956177404810655220,100497152992866587066,I took a chance going here, especially with previous review mentioning misbillings and other issues. Glad I went! Note that I visited for lunch during a weekday. __Food__ Damn good! I got a soup, chicken parmesian sandwich (+fries), coke, and coffee. Chicken parmesian sandwich was a tad bland, but would have been awesome with tomatoes/other veggies, which I forgot to order. __Cost__ They have a lunch special for $11 bucks. Best deal I've seen in months. Soup, sandwich, fries, unlimited soda -- all standard menu. Coffee was a couple more dollars, but was well worth it at the end of the meal. I was not misbilled like others, and have no complaints. __Ambience__ This place is as close as you can get to a real European cafe. Quiet, relatively small, and an emphasis on comfort. I would avoid if it was busy, but if you come during the week it seems to be pretty busy. Noise travels, and can be warm, so come with these in mind. If you come at the right time, you will be in for a real treat. And definitely get a coffee before you go!]
