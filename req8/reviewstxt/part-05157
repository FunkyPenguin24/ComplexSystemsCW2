[103217163470880184103,100431852643901454711,I'm a freshman there, and for the time being, it hasn't been so bad. You can retake tests, there is after-school tutoring, there is debate, sign, Stand and Deliver, and a bunch of other clubs, and the teachers are mostly nice with you. Also, we leave at 2:40 If you look like you got the flu, the nurse will send you home, so... Bad side is that it only has 2 languages, Spanish and French, unlike SPHS. The time to move between classes is 2 minutes, but it is flexible here and there. They force you to take Engineering for freshman year, but it's not so hard/bad. At least we got more AP than SPHS! :)]
