It’s always such a pleasure working with Rachel because I KNOW in advance I’ll love her designs—always outside what I can envision. And I can count on her asking the great strategic questions in advance, to keep her designs focused. She's great at talking with you and really eliciting what it is you're going for, to deliver what you need.]
