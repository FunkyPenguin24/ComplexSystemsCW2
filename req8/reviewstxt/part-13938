[102046992632201671578,100907671754004707153,I'm not sure why the other reviews here are awful. Maybe because only folks that have had problems feel the need to post their experiences. Here is mine... I took my wife's car and my car in to this Dobbs to get them inspected. In the case of my wife's car, no problems at all, I was in and back out (I waited in their waiting room) in just over an hour. With my car, the inspection went fine, but they told me that my front tires were a little bald. Mostly due to an alignment issue. They fixed the alignment issue and priced out two tires. Gave me a 25% discount when I told them I was unemployed and was wanting to discuss with my significant other. Told me that the quote was good for 30 days. I was out of the shop in about an hour and a half. I have nothing but great things to say about these guys. I have done business with them for almost 10 years and can't think of one bad thing to say about them.]
