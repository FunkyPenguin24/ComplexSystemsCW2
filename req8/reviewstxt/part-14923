[115251282780943546202,100963142156228759499,The thing that makes Judd Greenberg stand out is that he took time to understand my needs and he recommended policies that made sense. He can really explain insurance in a way that is simple and easy, and he makes purchasing insurance a breeze. Before talking to Mr. Greenberg, I found insurance confusing and a little intimidating. Now I "get it" and Mr. Greenberg has helped me create a long term financial plan. I can't say enough good things about his agency, you really should talk to him before buying any policy.]
