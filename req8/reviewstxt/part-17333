[101475046564837525732,101093411363962583508,EXCELLENT WORK! Kent at Doucette-Ewer Construction is THE best contractor I've ever worked with. He paid very careful attention to detail and used high quality materials even when it meant cutting into his margins. He did a great job! And I recommend him highly to anyone wanting to improve their home. Thanks, Kent!]
