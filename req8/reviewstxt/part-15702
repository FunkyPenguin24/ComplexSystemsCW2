Folks are knowledgeable and diligent, they were always available to me and my employer to explain the details of a process that seems convoluted and very user un-friendly. No call went unanswered -- I am generally a worrier and especially in immigration, but I honestly felt so well taken care of. My employer also is very appreciative of their competence and has recommended the firm to other colleagues. I am grateful for Glen's and his staff's support and could not have picked a better, more reliable and effective law firm. I'll be happy to provide further recommendations and, if I ever need legal help, I will always go back to them.]
