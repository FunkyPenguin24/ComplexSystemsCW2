[112231562683033285390,100776590861780413664,The waiter was a pleasant young man who did not seem that he was not that experiene d. However he tried. When the bread was brought out, it was luke, luke wam and hard. The crust was so hard, it could not be broken without force. The circular part of the bread was a bit softer, but not like garlic bread. The waiter brought us more bread and it was better. He explained the daily made bread, etc. The ordered dishes came. I had an egg noodle with ground veal and tomato sauce with a little cream. It was tasteless. There was a glimpse of tomato sauce and more cream. But it was not spicy. The garlic bread had red pepper on it. I took a salad that came with the meal, and thought I would be safe. But then a burning sensation came. When mentioning it to the waiter, he says -"Oh there must have been a jalapeno pepper hiding in the salad greens. Ha, ha" This salad was turned back and of course waste occurred. While eating, a very large serving, my guess said " look!" It was a baby roach crawling on the table. It scampered like roaches do, but we got it. Telling the waiter, he simply responded "do you want desert". He was told - we are leaving. He brought the bill with no apology, and we paid We should have walked out with no bill, but we ended up with a 27.00 bill and a terrible evening. I would never go back, and I surely don't recommend entering the front door for there may be free roaming roaches in the kitchen, unsupervised, untrained, and allowed to run as an unruly child.]
