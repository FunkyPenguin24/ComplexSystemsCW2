[111281241903060415126,100959641480493698816,I brought in my 2009 Sienna mini van which i purchased new for a tapping in the engine to be serviced. Van has always been serviced and used synthetic oil. The van was still under the manufacturer's warranty. I was told it was normal and sent home. Later that day a valve let loose and damages internal components to the engine. They repaired it in a couple of weeks and was given the van back. Now has a louder tapping in the engine and had no power. Returned the vehicle that day and was told it was ok and sent home. (my wife was picking up the vehicle each time not myself) Vehicle dropped a valve again and left my family on the side of the road. Somehow they fixed it again in a couple of days and was sent home. Engine was loud and did not run right we returned and was told to go home. Engine blew about 2 weeks later. This is the real kicker. I did everything according to the warranty rules. Opened a case with toyota manufacturing and was told they have no power just the actual dealer. The dealer's solution was to put a USED engine from the junkyard in it. Remember i bought the van new and was still under the original warranty. We were forced into putting the used engine in no other options were on the table. They gave us an extended warranty for the used engine. SO BEWARE of ROUTE 44 TOYOTA! Spoke with another toyota dealer and they were frank and told us we were getting screwed. They actually helped us a lot in trying to get a new engine for the van. I WILL NEVER EVER go there again. Don't go. Almost forgot. when my wife was in the service department the sales men were stalking my wife to buy a new van to avoid having this lemon of a van. My wife was in there so much and pressured her she broke down and cried for him to leave her alone. The manager was told and he was not allowed to speak to her again. So if you want high pressure go to them.]
