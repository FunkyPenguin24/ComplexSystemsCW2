[104056210263106390041,100891546292555525657,I was visiting a friend in Herndon last weekend and the first night there we decided to go for pizza. Well, I like my pizza a little more authentic, so we bypassed the chain establishments and landed at Piero's Corner. OH. MY. GOODNESS! This place is awesome!!! The cheese was fresh, the crust was crisp and the veggies were garden fresh. In fact, it was so good I picked up a pie on my way home! This time I got Italian sausage, mushroom, onion and pepper with extra cheese. It was delish! One word of caution, though, only order extra cheese if you really like extra cheese because they are generous with the toppings!]
