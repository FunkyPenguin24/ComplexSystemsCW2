[108159835185275017801,100300491707927323042,Yolanda gave me my first microderm facial and it was great. I got a lot of compliments about how good my skin looked. I lost touch with her for a while and had other spas perform microderms for me but I didn't look or feel as good as Yoland's. I was so happy to find Yolanda and Speranzi Facial Spa again! She set the standard for me and no other place is as good! I would definitely recommend her and have done so to numerous family and friends!!]
