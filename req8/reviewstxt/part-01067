[102214851084078336061,100214179469383410190,3 weeks ago the Thayer Hotel double-charged me for a one night stay. I would not have written this review if I had ANY indication that they were trying to fix this problem. I have called multiple times and have been avoided every time. Poor and unacceptable customer service.]
