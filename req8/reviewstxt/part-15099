[114175545675863924487,100972359722599302561,this " doctor " <HA> took my son away from me in 1997 and gave him to my ex-husband. Because a boy should be with his father, and out of a 400+ page report, one line was used against me, and believed. My ex would be violent verbally and physically throughout the whole marriage, yet because he paid the bill, she gave him custody. My son now has serious mental problems, can't work due to fibremyalgia, is depressed and suicidal, is on meds for these and others ranging from acid reflux to to schizophrenia, He is mean, foul mouthed, disrepectful to women and not a good sport. He also never got to play in team sports, and suffered with a step-mother and step-siblings. So his father spoiled him rotten to keep the peace. ** this was not in the best interest of the child and that people, I can prove - what happended to my son and his mental well being is EXACTLY as I said would happen. ** She refused to see my point of view in the divorce and have the fat balls to actually tell my mother that I am a bad mother because she is a bad mother. yea.. ok... thats why I have many other children who flock to me - of all ages, always did and will have that ability! She coached him thru all the testing, yet left me to do my own - after telling me that she helped him. She helps those who pay her bill, so yes, if you have money and want to have custody, call Dr Fatso, err.. Mueller.. She'll even feed your kids tons of candy at the un-favored parent just to watch the action... I wrote a letter to the governing body of her field, they said they couldn't help. I went to other psycologists, they were not so supportive of her decision or her clearly bias report. I highly recommend you do not hire this person, and after reading about it, share my story with others.. We can't allow these horrible practitioners to remain out there sending children to live with the wrong parent, just because they have lots of money.]
