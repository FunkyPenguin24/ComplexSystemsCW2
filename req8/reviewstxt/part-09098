[113989938943192787024,100644595977247394000,I have been getting my vehicles serviced with Fixcarnow for approximately the past 10 years. Initially, I would take my car in for a quick oil change, then I began taking my car to Fixcarnow for major repairs. I mainly deal directly with the mechanic who are very friendly, courteous and perform the actual work on my car. What I am most pleased with is their pricing; I've asked other auto shop about pricing just to compare it with Fixcarnow and they almost alway have the best price. I have sent many of my friends there and I highly recommend this place.]
