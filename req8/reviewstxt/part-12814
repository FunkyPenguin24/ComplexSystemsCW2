[112105998933704262597,100846739600352142116,When we moved recently our mortgage broker recommended Ben at Cottonwood Insurance. We figured it wouldn't hurt to get some quotes. Ben promptly gave us quotes that were better than anything else we had found. We were very pleased. His service didn't stop with selling the policy - my wife was recently involved in an accident and Ben helped facilitate the claim with Mutual of Enumclaw Insurance. Her car was totaled and I had lots of people telling me horror stories of bad settlements, etc. Both Ben and Mutual of Enumclaw couldn't have been easier to work with. I hope we don't ever have to use our policies like this again, but if so, I'm confident we'll get the service we need. I highly recommend Ben Bagley and Cottonwood Insurance!]
