[110998723202981296468,100207908990302372293,SLC Fit Collective is awesome! I started going there after buying a Living Social deal and made it my goal to try as many of the different classes as I could. The yoga classes are small enough that you get individual adjustments and encouragements. Kalari was a ton of fun and left my legs sore for days. As all the other reviews mention, boot camp is an amazing workout and always good for a laugh and a positive message. I really like using the suspension system for the workouts, its easy to adjust the amount of weight you're actually lifting as you get stronger (or on days you feel more tired :-) ).]
