[102838810363071979899,100774016459320440103,Mr. Fixit Fast was very prompt after we contacted them. They sent over Frank who was very competent and professional. They provided an accurate quote and Frank did an excellent job repairing the back fascia around the window. It was a delicate job because the wood was rotten around the window and a previous contractor had already broken the very large window. We are very happy with their work and will recommend Mr. Fixit Fast to anybody.]
