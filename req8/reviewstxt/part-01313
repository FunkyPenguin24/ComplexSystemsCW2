[102340471330620095120,100226776514627004157,The food was fine, but the service is slow. It took 10 minutes to have our drink orders taken. When we got our food, the runner who delivered it disappeared before we could confirm our acceptance of the food or whether we needed anything (which our Alfredo was dry and needed more sauce). Our entire party was done eating by the time we finally received our extra sauce which was hard to ask for as our waiter never walked by the table. The bread with our meal appeared along with the afore mentioned sauce. After asking for a box, we have been waiting for at least 5 minutes now. Tldr, the food is NOT worth the lack of service at the table.]
