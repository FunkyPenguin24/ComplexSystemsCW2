[113199710332958799531,100192847301779071667,The overall atmosphere was nice. The food was excellent, but our waitress was a bit of a... "female dog", if you catch my drift. I won't mention names, as these things are public and I don;t want to be the reason for someone else's trouble at work... Needless to say, despite the waitress, I was very happy with the overall experience. Will return in the future.]
