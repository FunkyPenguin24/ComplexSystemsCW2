[103063461794686893077,100649940593096754256,These places are donation based nonprofits. Goodwill in Oregon has stepped up their game in the last decade. This is due in large part due to the more retail business approach started by the head of Oregon Goodwill who felt people would like to have at least a clean, well lit, and semi organized experience. (a huge change from what it was a decade ago or is found in other states) Oregon Goodwill is massively successful as a result! other states are now following the model set by Oregon. the guy earned his pay, taking a company that was limping along to a whole new level. To clear up some posts GOODWILL IS A NON PROFIT (look up their business licence in oregon) Thats why donations are tax deductible.) most hospitals are too as well as some insurance companies like statefarm. This ONLY means that people get paid a fair market wage (determined by the state) and there are no share holders that receive any profits. Dont confuse this with free.]
