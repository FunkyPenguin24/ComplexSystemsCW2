[117027893015680636363,101162997200898869965,Cash, my 2 yr old pomeranian/yorkie mix dog, LOVES Firehouse!! Dr Faught is the best vet in Austin: extremely knowledgeable, super friendly, loves animals, and Cash LOVES him. Dr Faught efficiently explains treatments and the various options that may be available. WIthout a doubt, he is extremely caring and makes sure to follow-up to ensure things are ok for your little guy or girl. The clinic is incredible: very welcoming, top of the line, beautiful, modern, clean, and has state of the art equipment. The staff is great, they are all soo friendly and welcoming, and very considerate of every customer/pet that walks in the door. Firehouse makes bringing your pet to the vet so enjoyable (not just for you, but for pet!)]
