[109554638213553223657,101174786124248555408,When me and my husband arrived at Marlowe Ink everyone treated us great. I brought a picture in and Danny was going to tattoo it on me. We were in the waiting room patiently waiting to get the sketch done, admiring some of the work on the walls. There were photos everywhere so my husband stepped into the hall and immediately got chewed out. You are not to leave the waiting room to see any of the pictures in the hall or anywhere else. Okay, that was fine.--But the lady at the desk could have been much nicer about it. Then Danny was done and we were going to the back room to get tattooed! All of a sudden they yell at my husband because the only people allowed to be in the room is the artist and the person getting the tattoo. I did not want to get this done alone. It was my birthday and my husband is getting deployed to Afghanistan in a couple weeks so I wanted to spend the experience with him. They didn't care about any of that. They said someone at one time stole some tattoo equipment so now no one can have company back there. So I told Danny I guess I will go somewhere else to get it done. I'm not going to get it done alone. I politely asked for my drawing back and he said 'absolutely not!' and crumpled it up and threw it in the trash. I couldn't be more disgusted with this place. We ended up going to Patriots and couldn't have been happier with their service or quality of tattoo! My husband actually ended up getting one too that night! Highly recommend Logan and Kat from Patriots!]
