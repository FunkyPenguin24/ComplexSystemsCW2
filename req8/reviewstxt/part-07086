[103919076170219095021,100536706750500558992,Just purchased my 5th Honda from Roush. Outstanding staff. "My" salesperson, Leigh Daniels, is outstanding. He is the person you want to work with when you purchase a vehicle. The Service department is also top-notch. I have appreciated the amenities in the waiting area as well, large screen TV, coffee, vending machines, computers with internet access, play area for kids. It is very family-oriented. I would also recommend getting the rental car added to your purchase. They make it very easy to drop off your car for one of the bigger services and pick up a rental to use instead of bumming a ride, or waiting around for the service to finish. It is obvious to their customers why they earn the Presidential award. Highly recommended.]
