[115938685580804865239,100733261211373135301,Worst Location!!!! Avoid!!! So I had received a coupon to Great Clips. It had a set of 3 coupons and each one expired about a month apart from the other. I had previously used the first coupon at this location with no problem. When I went to use the second valid coupon that was not expired and had expiration date clearly written on it. The employees ganged up on me saying that the coupon was not for their location and that the one for their location had already expired. They didn't even let me explain, but they ran to the back pulling the expired coupon that they had claiming that they had the coupon, but it was expired. On my coupon it states that it is "Good at greater Dallas/Fort Worth area salons". What makes the least sense is that the coupon was sent to my address which is in the same zip code as this Great Clips. The employee charged me full price and kept on saying that the coupon was expired and it was not their location. When it clearly has the expiration date on the coupon proving the it had not been expired. Needless to say I will not be going back. I would recommend others to avoid, unless they like arguing with rude employees.]
