[117690457763926047005,100042260657594146329,Having never purchased a car long distance, I came in to this situation extremely skeptical. I was buying a very expensive car and trading my car, not having seen the new car. I am a very cautious buyer, so thought something could be wrong with the car or that the dealership wouldn't do what they said. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, we drove almost 1,200 miles to check it out first-hand and everything was as Trent represented it to be. I would very highly recommmend this dealership and Trent. When I get ready to buy my next car, they will certainly be in the running for my business--even being 4 states away. Definitely worth the drive. Beyond that, their follow up after the sale has been superb. Any and every issue I've brought to their attention they've remedied to my satisfaction. You can't go wrong here!]
