[104920240860098487063,100146655401558170246,This is a truly outstanding model of much needed service delivery ....one which takes away all the stigma around sexual health and associated problems. It is not a gay clinic although it serves a large gay population The Chelsea and Westminster should be congratulated by everyone by this innovative approach which everyone agrees is an example we can all learn from. Unfortunately despite this they are always under threat from budget cuts - which is deplorable but typical ...set up great clinic, prove its a success and then see if you whittle it away...imaginative downsizing??? The staff are always courteous and the whole place makes an effort to ensure everyone is comfortable. Thats not bad for starters leave alone the well thought out decor and excellent medical staff. If only Mental Health Services could learn something from this approach instead of languishing in ggrim back wings of hospitals. How about a service like this for adults with ADHD, who are usually either not treated or treated like junkies This is national service so ANYONE can walk in or call for advice. WONDERFUL ***** five stars MORE PLEASE - This is how is CAN and should be DONE]
