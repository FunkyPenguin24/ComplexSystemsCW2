[104624705943550625346,100671527884305729335,My name is Brenda Ellison and my husband and I went to Long Hyundai recently and purchased a Santa Fe. Our salesman was Zak Ibnsliman he was very helpful in explaining the features and process of purchasing the vehicle. He went out of his way to make sure we were happy with our purchase and is a very nice man. Thank you Zak for making the whole family feel welcomed and thank you long hyundai you will now be our dealer for life. It was a great experience.]
