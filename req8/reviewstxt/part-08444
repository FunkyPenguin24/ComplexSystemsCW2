[107669073562027486039,100610722232093063020,The first time I went to visit was a thursday night- ladies night. I was actually very impressed by the ambiance. I wasn't expecting a restaurant that nice to have free drinks for ladies. I went with one of my girlfriends, sat at the bar and ordered some tapas. I had a cheese montadito, which was so good I had to order another one. The bartenders were very friendly, easy to talk to and gave me some recommendations on what they thought was best]
