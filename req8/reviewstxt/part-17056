[103229869028508736351,101079301152576984583,I recently got engaged and wanted to have my grandmother's engagement ring and wedding ring resized for my fiancee. I had heard of the Jewelry Appraiser from a family member and, not knowing anything about jewelry whatsoever, I decided to give it a shot. I was thoroughly impressed. Deborah did an excellent job of measurements and took great care to ensure that the resized rings fit extremely well. The rings look brand new with some platinum "repronging" as well that really makes the diamonds stand out. Very satisfied and will definitely go back here again for any future jewelry needs.]
