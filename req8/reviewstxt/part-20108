[104485518642946092878,100065828178189057476,I would highly recommend using Reliable for any HVAC issues. I have an older home that was too hot upstairs during the summers and too cold downstairs. I had 3 other HVAC companies give me their solutions and they were all different. Finally, I called Dan Jape at Reliable and he put me in touch with one of his solution and design guys, Michael Cole. Michael was fabulous! He immediately came up with solution, explained exactly what he wanted to do, drew up a design and had a detailed estimate to me that day. The estimate was extremely reseasonable so I scheduled my service for the next week. My service guys were Dustin and Milo who were both outstanding. They spent all day and most of the evening at my house making sure the work was completed by the end of the day. Most importantly, for me, they were extremely clean and always wore booties when coming inside. When they left you couldn't tell they were even there. I am thrilled with the outcome. I finally have cold air pumping upstairs! Thank you Reliable!]
