[114893695801966194698,101104341759079064783,I came here for my first (and ONLY) time last week, and I must say they have a mediocre selection of decent beer......... BUT the prices are comparable, if not better, most other places that have craft beers. I will say though, the customer service my girlfriend and I received would be the only positive reason for returning.... although that does only go for the employees. I honestly have never in my life felt as weird and creeped out, as I did from the "owner". (Reason I quotation it, is because NO owner should feel it okay to conduct himself the way this one did!) As we arrived, we were greeted with awesome smiles and hello's. We definitely felt like it was a comfortable and warm environment, but that was only until we had a few sips of our ciders we ordered... about 45 seconds into them we were greeted by an individual named Steve, I believe, who I later found out was the owner. He started off very personable and nice it seemed, but in the next few visits he seemed to attempt to warm up to us (i.e. putting his hand on our shoulders, and complimenting on our looks). At first we were a bit weirded out, until we observed him inside siting at a table drinking what clearly looked like beer (which I believe is illegal?) . After that, we were a bit suspicious of the entire establishment. He continued to go around and talk to other customers, and it seemed as though he would be especially close and warm to women. We were VERY reluctant when another employee would be at our table, before the owner had a chance to stop. Needless to say, we are very indifferent on returning to the Hoppy, and I do apologize... but if we do return, it will only be made if the owner is not present. So if any ladies are reading this, and are planning to have a relaxing drink outing, try and bring a man with you!]
