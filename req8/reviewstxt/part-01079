[104724482172430321623,100214601340501200315,I met my husband up on Cape Cod, and this is the first beach he took me to. Coming from being a SOUTH NJ shore girl (Cape May, Wildwood), Kalmus Beach is a nice, refreshing place to be. The air is rejuvenating up there, and the beaches are pristine. I never see a ridiculous quantity of people there, and never run in to issues. Whoever said something about a bunch of illegals obviously has some sort of other agenda going on. Remember, our country started out there with "illegals".]
