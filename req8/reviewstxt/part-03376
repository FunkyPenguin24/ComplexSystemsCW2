[105909148913134681420,100333425870747760559,Great experience, got the online coupon, easily found the location, but mainly, I was able to get a good bike! I'm a very active cyclist and when I don't have access to my road bike or triathlon bike, I'm usually not satisfied with other bikes. I rented a very solid Specialized Allez, perfect size for me (and there was many other sizes available, bigger and smaller". I was able to bike all the way out to Hawk Hill with that bike which I wouldn't have been able to that easily on a regular hybrid or mountain bike. Prices are also competitive or cheaper than other bigger chains of bike rental in the city.]
