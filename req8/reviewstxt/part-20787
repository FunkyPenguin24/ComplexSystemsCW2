[101914595782663243587,100101095705816501641,Ok - I had a clog removed then I needed a water heater. The old one just was not keeping up. I got Sacramento Water Heater to take a look. A high cost job into a low cost Thermostat replacement! They could have lied to me and told me the thermo couple can not be replaced but they made it happen. Great people.]
