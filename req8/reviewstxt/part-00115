[114330781465840926010,100164827453948431266,This does not concern the local store or local employees! I am totally fed up with trying to get the national web site to work. This is the last straw today. Once again tried to get into their website to make an on line purchase and as usual it didn't work! COME ON HHGREGG either get the site fixed and working properly or take the thing down completely! I can't help but wonder if it is just us or is this nationwide? Probably won't get any response but at least they, HHGREGG, know how one potential customer feels. Not even worth a partial star!]
