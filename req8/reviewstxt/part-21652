[109236508939953943808,100147852009191615269,I purchased a 2014 LX-S today thanks to the expertise and sincere assistance from Michael Martin. Frankly, I was floored by the genuine concern demonstrated by all the folks at Mohawk Honda. Everyone there makes you feel at home and at ease with what can be an daunting and impactful financial transaction. I'm convinced you can go to Mohawk Honda and buy a car without worrying about being "sold" something you don't need. Bottom line: these folks are DEFINITELY in the buyer's corner!]
