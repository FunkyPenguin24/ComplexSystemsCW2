[103517633659130685725,101117082184728026019,We went there for my wife's 50th birthday. We had never been to a tea room before, and frankly, being a male, wasn't sure how enjoyable it would be. It actually turned out to be a fun time for all, and my wife really appreciated it. They made her and the rest of us feel special, the service was great, and the food was terrific! Highly recommend!!!]
