[105763493994175814674,101056477336690397714,Eugene made an appointment with us today to fix our Danby wine fridge between 11am and 1pm. Around 2:30 he called to say he was running late and that he would head over. I asked him specifically what time he would make it. And he said around 4:30pm. So my wife waited for him, and again no call no show. She wasted her entire day waiting for this guy. Would recommend you go with someone else for your service needs.]
