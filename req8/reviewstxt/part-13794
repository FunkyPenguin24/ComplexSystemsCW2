[100501651895739573741,100900666909273071196,I was on the board of our home owners association. We have a small board of volunteer members, and a small assocation that is run fairly smoothly. Some of the administrative items can seem confusing when we lack specific skills or knowledge. We thought it would be helpful to have an outside management company help us. We hired Association Services. These guys wereTERRRIBLE!!! We asked how much we would spend each month. They said $400-$600 on the highest. Our first bill from them was $1600 and the next month was $1700 and the next was $1100. We were all sick.We spoke with them about the bill and why it was so high and what we could do differently to lower the bill. They said the initial "Set up cost". They never said a word about set up costs when we signed up with them. They were quickly depleting our reserves that we work hard to save up, and they did not do anything for us! We could not leave soon enough. They are deceptive in their pracitice. What was worse than the expensive fees they charged, is they were inaccurate in quoting payoffs. We had a home in our association that owed $965 in back dues. Association Services quote $0, but collected a transfer fee of $150. We lost those dues. They provided us no help. They are only about FEES, FEES, FEES. Their business ethics are poor, and I would NEVER reccomend them to anyone. Please do not get dupped by them like we were! Find someone else or you better off muddling through it yourself than using this company.]
