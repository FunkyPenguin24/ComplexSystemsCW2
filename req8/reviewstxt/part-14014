[110481950133880020218,100912252606425258673,I was a transfer student from another local school and because of that I had the lowest priority for registration. There were two times for the class I needed to finish my series and because of my priority, the class was already filled with 4 people on the wait list for both listings before I even had the chance to sign up. The staff only redirects you to another department and never seem that happy to help. Websites confusing and parking is always ridiculous in the morning. The campus is nice as well as a majority of the student body, however I would definitely need a while to think of another positive thing to say about the school.]
