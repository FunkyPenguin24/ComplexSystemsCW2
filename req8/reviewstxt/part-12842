[115658196387604513270,100848301559593221970,I made a reservation because I value my time. When I arrived I was told it was going to 1hour and 45 min wait because it had gotten busy. All I needed was a rotation, which I could do in 20 minutes with a lift and a tire plug which would take them no longer than 5 minutes. What is the point of making a reservation if you have to wait the normal amount of time? Terrible customer service.]
