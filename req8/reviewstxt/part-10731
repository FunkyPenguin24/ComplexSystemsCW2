[114384996264108654673,100732963431373232259,The Country Inn and Suites was about what you would expect for a budget hotel near an airport. The rooms were clean and breakfast was complimentary. My only complaint was that the smoking rooms were on the same floor as the non-smoking rooms; consequently, everything smelled like cigarette smoke. I filled out the survey they sent me after my stay and mentioned the complaint in the comment section. In response, they sent an email that said, in part: "I have addressed your concerns with our team, and I assure you we are working diligently to ensure a similar situation does not occur again in the future." How, exactly, would addressing this issue with 'our team' fix the location of the smoking rooms? Honestly, I would have rather not received a response than a response that implicitly acknowledges they didn't read my comments in the first place. If you need a place to crash and want to smoke in your room, this is probably a hotel you'd want to consider. If you want fast Internet connections, a swimming pool larger and deeper than something you'd pick up at a Walmart, and don't want to carry the faint aura of an ashtray with you to wherever you're going after the hotel, you might consider a different destination.]
