[112936955284112540985,100880978255626200100,Rustico Tile and Stone recently installed an absolute beautiful Travertine floor and shower in my master bath. The transformation is remarkable and I am incredibly happy with the craftsmanship. The guys that worked on it were prompt, efficient, respectful, and did a fantastic job. I have absolutely no reservations recommending this company. Thank you to Ray, Melanie, and the rest of the crew at Rustico. I cannot wait to have my kitchen backsplash done by them!]
