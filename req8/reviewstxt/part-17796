[101919203561405897339,101119883564259371874,It has been a month of fantastic gas mileage since I bought my Honda Civic from Pat Peck. Love that Little green energy saving ECONomy button and I am learning to actually drive at or under the speed limit to see just how high I can get the mileage. I finally found a small problem and visited the service department. At first I thought I was going to get the run around but they not only addressed the problem, they came out of pocket with an upgrade that would defiantly prevent a recurrence. In and out in a half hour. Sweet. J. J. Smith Vancleave, Ms]
