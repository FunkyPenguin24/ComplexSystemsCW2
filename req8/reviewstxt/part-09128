[100677135630270396297,100645960458426075605,Horrible management and unwillingness to step-up and help out their customers. Repair person failed to make two appointments in a row. The company was not concerned that I had to take off work and wait more than three hours on two separate occasions. I was only given an apology and informed they didn't expect me to re-book my appointment a third time. If they really cared about customer services they would have had someone at my house the following day for no charge or at least a substantial discount. I can't comment on the quality of their repair work as it never happened. If you want to potentially waste your time for no reason feel free to give them a call. They'll try and entice you with their cheap prices, but it is not worth the aggravation.]
