[108539629883920694493,101123842201073716487,It appears they foster a culture of lies, lies and more lies by sales people (not just one). I was in the market for a 2014 Tundra CrewMax TRD and they were committed to selling a new, 2013 version. Perhaps there were incentives to push old inventory. However, to facilitate their objectives they tried every trick in the book except being professional about it. In fact, if they knew their products even marginally, they could have made the sale as there was a huge value proposition for the 2013 version, at the time. Darcars is a textbook example of why Auto Sales people get a bad rap. Further, they made my information available to all their sales people resulting in as many as 8 calls in one day, weeks after I had already purchased my truck. I will never again consider Darcars. Costco Auto Purchase program should be ashamed of being associated with an organization such as Darcars. If it was an isolated incident with one Sales Person, I would not have left this review.]
