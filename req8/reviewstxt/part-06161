[110448687289814702650,100485989316364610718,I have gone to this theater multiple times in my life, with friends and dates and such. For service I find that the staff are moderately polite, though compared to people in the area very polite, and they always seem to be helpful. The concessions are expensive, I'll give it that. The theater is oldish but it's not falling apart, the facilities are up to date so I don't ever see its age as a problem. Like all theaters, the popular movies are shown on large screens and the movies that have been out for a while are in the smaller screening rooms, not all the screens are big, but most aren't small. Overall, I like the theater and continue to go there often due to convenience and preference.]
