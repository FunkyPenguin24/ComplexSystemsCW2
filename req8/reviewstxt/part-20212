[101235646442726626509,100071380423614794452,My partner and I had lunch here. I ordered a chicken ranch burger. Burger was nice, but needed more ranch sauce. Huge in size. Chips that came with it were soggy and tasteless. Partner got battered fish and chips. Fish was soggy and unpleasant. Chips were also soggy. Atmosphere is nice though. Food should have been of better standard.]
