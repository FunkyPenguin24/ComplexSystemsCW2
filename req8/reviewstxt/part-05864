[107669353348844029138,100469959527791988269,Without question the lunch myself and my friends had at Atithi today was the best Indian food I have experienced in over twenty years. Which, speaking as someone fortunate enough to have eaten at some of the best restaurants the world over during my travels as a touring musician…is truly saying something. The entire experience was exactly as it should be, from start to finish. The waiting staff were attentive yet subtly non-intrusive, the food exquisitely presented by Chef and tasted sublime. Truly a central London gourmet Indian meal but with half the price-tag. If this is the shape and taste of 21-st century Indian dining then look no further than dear old Twickenham…really,really! I urge you to go along and try it for yourselves.]
