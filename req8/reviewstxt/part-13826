[111021282160681576089,100902007493274587634,May's Thai Kitchen is my favorite Thai Food Restaurant to date!The food is excellent and a very good value! There also have vegan friendly dishes on the menu and everything tastes fresh! Anything can be made spicy and my husband and I love it that way! Great little family owned restaurant and May herself is lovely. My favorite dishes are: All the curries, pad thai, pad la na chicken, black pepper and garlic beef, pad pri king, pineapple fried rice, and the soups are delish! Whenever I go out of town, May's is the first place I go to when I come back! And she does catering! Can't say enough about the place. Lol. I highly recommend May's Thai Kitchen.]
