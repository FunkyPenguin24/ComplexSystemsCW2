[105104961481113847799,100072980479477358887,I was in their store this week and tried to buy 2 wine stoppers. The cashier helping me just kept running my card through their machine telling me it didn't go through. I realized she really didn't know what she was doing, very poor attitude and I needed to find a ladies room since their store doesn't allow their customers to use their facilities. So I told her to never mind ringing me up and I left their store without a purchase but now I have 2 charges on my credit card in the amount of $19.15 each. I printed everything out so I could go to their store and correct their mistake but my luck they are closed on Sunday, needless to say, very unpleasant experience. I will be in their store 1 more time to get my money back and then never again. Poor customer service, be sure to check your bank records if you don't use cash.]
