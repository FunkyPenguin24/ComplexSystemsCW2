[114637662368132201716,100615123228261467992,We were at this Applebee's today and everything was fine until I found a folded piece of paper in my Oriental Chicken Salad. When I brought the server over she was very apologetic, brought the manager over who said they would comp me my salad and give me another one. I said thank you and asked that since some time had passed that they please bring me the salad in a to-go container because we had to leave. I checked the salad when I got home and they didn't give me any dressing for the salad! So now I have a dry salad. I called them and they said I could come and get some dressing, but the restaurant is out of my way, so I declined. They did offer to send out some coupons as an apology, but I'm a little tired of the apologies piling up on one another. We went there because my mother-in-law had a gift card. But I doubt I'll go there again.]
