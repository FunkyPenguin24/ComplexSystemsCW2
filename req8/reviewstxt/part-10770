[100726247024599975644,100734685232428287289,I've had several experiences with Sudsies, so far, all very good. Dry cleaning comes back like brand new. I've had several suits altered and fitted as I've gained and lost weight over the years. But the best is the last minute "I forgot about xyz event and I need this tuxedo by tomorrow"...and they've always come through. I find them to be very reliable and professional.]
