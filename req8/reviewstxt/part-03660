[112992606365155963845,100350104844089762851,Although the temperature was in the mid 30's the air conditioner failed to work. We had no assistance from the staff who seemed incapable to help us! The owner was away at a funeral. When we did get to speak to her she was very irate and quite rude. She had said that the air conditioning was working but she was wrong! As I have high blood pressure that heat for me was intolerable. We had no alternative but to leave, late at night, and travel back home. She did give us a credit note, good for a year. But when we tried to use the credit note i.e. sell it to someone on kijiji the rooms seemed unavailable! We paid $1800 for two bedrooms. We never got to sleep there! We paid for a gourmet meal which the owner did not reimburse us for. NOT IMPRESSED.]
