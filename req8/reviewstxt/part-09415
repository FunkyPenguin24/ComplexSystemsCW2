[112309312014379114100,100661700187838328489,I've never dealt with a landlord or management company that had less respect for their tenants. The employees are all nice, but that doesn't cut it. A month or two into my lease the fire door was replaced in my bedroom. (Varsity Management has a tendency to do maintenance on the apartment without any explanation of why or much notice). The guy who installed the new door and door frame left huge gaps between the two--I could see light from outside coming on--which resulted in my bedroom having an average temperature of about 50 degrees during the winter. When I complained, a worker was sent out to put some foam between the door and door frame. This did nothing. On another occasion near the end of my lease, Varsity decided to do electrical work in the middle of the week in the evening requiring the power to be shut off for the whole building. They did this two Tuesdays in a row. One of these days, the power was off when I got home from work, about 5:30pm, although it was probably shut off at 3pm, and didn't come back on until 11:45pm. Varsity Management's treatment of its tenants is ridiculous. I would recommend avoiding them for housing.]
