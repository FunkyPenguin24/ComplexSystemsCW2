[103948116856654848247,100100694048770377929,Drinks were very good, but I was appalled by the service I received. Homophobic, overcrowded, and rude. If you are looking for a friendly and appreciative bar, please look elsewhere. I stepped outside for a quick chat and a breath of fresh air after a drink, and upon reentering, I was met with a forceful shove from the bouncer. He exclaimed that there were others waiting before me to enter the bar.....after I had already been in...I expressed this to the bouncer, who reinstated what he had already said.... I began to reevaluate this logic, but came up empty handed. Upon waiting for the others to reenter, I was met with homophobic slurs by the bouncer and the patrons outside. I know this is the Marina, who, already has a bad reputation with seemingly and/or declared gay clientelle, but the STAFF?! I would never wish this experience upon anyone who simply wishes to have a nice time at casual bar.]
