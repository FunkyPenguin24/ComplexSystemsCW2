[113235184397368883154,100468728853260275515,I just want to tell EVERYONE how awesome Emily Parks is- she really is excellent at her job.... she is friendly, understanding and listens and she really goes the extra mile when it comes to the specifics on what your looking for..... She was so patient with me when I changed something or wanted details in another area or just needed some time... unlike a lot of the other Promove agents (I have dealt with a few in the past!) she was not annoying and borderline stalker when trying to close in on her referral.... she was courteous and appropriate every single correspondence. Everyone should use her- she makes the process so easy!!!!! she is so awesome, I even referred my boyfriend to her when he was looking too!!!! --- thanks Emily!!!]
