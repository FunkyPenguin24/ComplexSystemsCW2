[118157169169543869831,100499025924023275888,I love to go to the High Tide Cafe' and have their clam chowder. HONESTLY, it has a unique and wonderful flavor. The ONLY clam chowder with it's flavor around here and it does NOT have a floury taste. My daughters and I treat our selves off and on throughout the year. We've had some of their other dishes and they are good, it's just that the clam chowder is our favorite. We love to sit at the windows over looking the water...and on warmish days, at their outside tables. NOT once have we had bad service. It is not the cheapest cafe' but it is moderately priced and not too expensive. It's a place you can go into from work as well as dress up a bit as the decor is not fancy but warm and cozy. One of my favorite places to go in the local area!]
