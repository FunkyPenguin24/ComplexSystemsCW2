[100439713247659005699,100641054363499754117,This was my first car shopping experience. As a recent college graduate bound for law school I knew I was on a tight budget and I was not looking forward to pushy salesman and the lure of false promises. HOWEVER this WAS NOT the case at all at Port Charlotte Honda. Our sales rep, John Sennett, was very knowledgeable, personable, and helpful in this endeavor making it completely painless. It would highly recommend purchasing a car at this dealership and working with John.]
