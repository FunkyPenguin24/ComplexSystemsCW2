[105035897684891299808,100668133913703364017,Whats INSIDE is what counts. This hotel isnt much to look at from outside. The neighborhood is iffy, and the traffic on the street is loud. But the indoors is classy, slightly dated, but the service is great. Everyone was super helpful and friendly. The room was CLEAN. Like I said, the carpets and furniture in the lobbys and halls is old, but the rooms were spacious and clean, and well insulated from noise. I was very comfortable here! and a standard room came with fridge and microwave. The complimentary shuttle was driven by a very friendly man, who knew the area well, and it runs in the morning, and the evening. It made going out for the day very convienent for us. Money well spent. I would suggest this one to anyone!]
