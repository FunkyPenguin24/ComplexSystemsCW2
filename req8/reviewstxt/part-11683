[101024133418722778975,100784627536956334697,We moved to Concord three years ago, and it took me several tries to find my go to auto repair service. Once I found Brother, I've not gone to anyone else. Quality service, quality work, and friendly. This is an old fashioned family owned business. In the past three years they've replaced my tires, flush transmissions, fixed lights, gas lines, rattling exhaust, changed oils, gosh I know I am forgetting some... With three "older" cars, I am glad I've found them for all my car needs! I highly recommend it to anyone.]
