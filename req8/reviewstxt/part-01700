[107817484068728388742,100247658562690009993,After researching Laser Lipo online I decided to give Sono Bello a call. Had a consultation with Nicole a few days later and decided right then and there that I was at the right place with the right people at the right time. Had the procedure done a couple weeks later and it's been one of the best decisions of my life. Dr Soler is amazing and the Laser Lipo procedure was virtually painless in my experience. I experienced a little soreness for a few days afterwards but I was up and going the very next day. The results are unbelievable and I continue to see them each and every week. Can't say enough about the staff, (Yahaira, Mike, Nicole, Raini, Jessica, April, Anie, Heidi and Shianne) everyone there just makes you feel like you're part of the family. I'm now going in weekly for Venus Freeze and starting to see results from those treatments as well. If you're considering Laser Liposuction you should pick up the phone and give Nicole at Sono Bello a call, it's really that simple.]
