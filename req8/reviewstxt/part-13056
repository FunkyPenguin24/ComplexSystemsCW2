I know when you order any battered chicken dish you get the worst cuts of meat caked with excessive batter. I ordered General Tso chicken and shrimp (Dragon & Phoenix). Most of the "chicken" was tough and chewy and the shrimp was just as bad. They sliced it open as is often done but these otherwise large shrimp were strangely VERY Flat as though they didn't just split them, but also cut out some of the meat. Customer service was lacking too. Walked in, behind another customer, after they left I stood there for a few minutes unacknowledged.]
