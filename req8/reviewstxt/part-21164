[116203075765689749176,100121335804671410863,This place is a NON-SMOKING establishment now. There is not a cat either. They DO serve food... though they are not a restaurant. You won't find a better place to shoot pool than here. The equipment is in great condition, the room is pretty big and has a clean 'contemporary' style unlike other stereotypical 'hole in the wall' places. Their drafts are cheap and its only $10bux to shoot during the day. You don't have to be a 'pool player' to have a good time there either.]
