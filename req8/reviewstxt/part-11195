[107746210668011182840,100758175327068279321,I didn't find this place nearly as horrid as the other reviewers did. My husband and I decided to give the place a try anyway and I'm glad we did. Likes: The food was excellent quality, good quantity, hot and came to us within a very reasonable time frame. We went for dinner (around 630pm) and spent about $40 including tip and one alcoholic beverage. The service was fast and correct. Our server was nice and friendly. The place was open enough that the couple with the very busy children were not a disruption at all. Dislikes: We were given a choice of where to sit and chose a booth rather than a table. The booth happened to be across from where people go outside to smoke. When they exited to smoke we were blasted with cold air and upon their return we were hit smoke-filled cold air. Next time we will just sit somewhere else. We will return :)]
