[105544091224075277184,100246115839076070386,I am surprising how people had a bad experience, since I am tasting Shanmukha's food from the past one year. The quality of the food was awesome, the Boneless chicken Biriyani taste was unbeatable. Also when compared to other Restaurants the cost is very nominal.]
