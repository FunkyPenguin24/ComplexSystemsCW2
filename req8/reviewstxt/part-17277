[104151396106135898069,101091167668949083628,It was my first visit and unfortunately I will not be returning. Our waitress, Lizeth, was great, but our chef on the other hand, was not. He overcooked all of our meats (chicken and shrimp) and gave us the wrong type of steak when it should have been given to the other party; we got filet and they had ribeye but he gave us the ribeye. Another party asked if their steak was cooked medium rare because it looked well done, but the chef said it was. The filet was actually good once we got it, but the chicken and shrimp for me was way overcooked. The service also took way too long to cook all of the food by far. The rice and noodles were good, but by the time we got our meat, everything else was stone cold because it took the chef so long to cook everything. I love hibachi, but I will be going somewhere else next time to actually enjoy it.]
