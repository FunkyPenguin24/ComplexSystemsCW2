[112779626361977771727,100086698472069179425,I just had a great time, class was very informative and had fun learning. It's a little nerve racking handling a firearm but this group of instructors really put you at ease and geniunely care that you leave there with a better understanding and a better sense on how to handle a firearm. I would recommend this class highly. I was so excited when I left I forgot to say Thank you to the instructors so Thank you!!]
