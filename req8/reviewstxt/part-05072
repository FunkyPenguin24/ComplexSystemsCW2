[100892611923712659218,100427178280636763002,I absolutely hate coming to this Walmart. I seriously doubt the validity of the positive reviews of this store. 2 years ago, I didn't mind shopping here late at night, like 2 a.m. There are 2 good employees here, Angel and Diana that work the night shift. But every other time I've been here it's been a negative experience. One day, it was the cashier COMPLETELY ignoring me and carrying on a conversation with a cart pusher, and even used foul language in front of me while ringing my items. (I'm talking f-word foul language) I reported her to the CSR on duty, but he didn't seem interested in resolving the issue. And tonight, I rushed in to purchase a clear nose ring retainer before the jewelery department closed. I needed one for work and I barely made it at 9:50, 10 minutes before they were supposed to close, only to find it already closed down. I asked an employee working in the area if there was anyone who could help me, because I have to have it before work tomorrow, and she simply shrugged and said "Once it close, it closed" (verbatim) I said they were supposed to be open till 10, and can she call a manager to open it for me. It's a $5 piece of plastic, not like a $300 ring. She said no, she couldn't call a manager, they can't open it. I mean, really?! I know that's a lie. Why would a manager not have access to it? I've worked for Walmart before, and I know they can access the jewelery department. The parking lot is filthy and you're lucky to find a parking spot that hasn't been turned into a buggy corral. the employees don't give a crap and are rude. And you can hardly walk in the store with out getting second hand smoke poisoning from all the employees smoking by the entrance. I recommend driving 2 miles south to the Red Oak Walmart, or 3 miles down Belt Line to the Desoto Walmart. They seriously need to just shut this one down.]
