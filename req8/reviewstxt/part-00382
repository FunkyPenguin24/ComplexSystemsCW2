[106961808407014790315,100179071680617757290,Giving some much needed love: I've been with T-Mobile for almost 10 years and recently moved to the St. Louis area. I've been to this store 3 times and each experience was great. First was to purchase 3 galaxy S4's. Service was great. It took a while, only because the computer systems wouldn't let the agent ring up the devices for full purchase. My agent had to have me pay for the 3 down payments, then pay off the rest in another transaction. Not his fault, and he was very apologetic. Second was to pick up some accessories, same agent, and he actually showed me where and how to make the purchase online to save me money! Waste of a trip? Not to save money!!! The third: had an issue with one of the S4s and TMO customer care said they couldn't do anything about it. Same agent was able to process a warranty exchange, and we had the new phone in 2 days. I'm heading there again tomorrow to pick up some Galaxy Note 3's. Maybe it's just the agent but I love going to this store, and I love being a T-Mobile customer.]
