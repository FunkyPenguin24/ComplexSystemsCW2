[104832236338752245343,100397533151210709003,The photos Mark took were amazing. It really captured the behind the scenes moments before, during and after our wedding perfectly. We love sharing the DVDs with our family and friends. Not only were the photos perfect, but Mark was so great to work with. He got everyone together for the shots we wanted, without being intrusive. We're so glad we chose him as our photographer for this once in a lifetime event. - Katie & Brian Daggett]
