[102383703920005737868,100119357532187384627,I purchased a pre-owned 2010 TL from Sarun Pho, last Friday and I was very pleased with the entire purchasing process. She accommodated my schedule very well and kept in communication in the method which I preferred. Sarun made the entire process very easy for me, no pressure, and always very professional. I wish my previous car purchasing experience was the same. I highly recommend working with Sarun if you are thinking about purchasing a vehicle.
