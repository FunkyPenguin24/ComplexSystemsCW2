[111358622391510171247,100861371729994699659,My daughter and I enjoyed a really pleasant stay at this hotel. The room was comfortable, the breakfast delicious and the staff welcoming and friendly. I would recommend it without reservation. My only advice would be make sure you know where you are going. Armed with only a map it did take us quite a time to locate it!]
