The wait staff is friendly. The decor is right from the 70's, but you should overlook that because the food is good. I recommend the potato/cheese [Ruskie] pierogies. The saurekraut/mushroom are good too. The best deal is the Polish platter. It's a smagoaboard of different Polish dishes. For dessert [if you have room] get some blintzes.]
