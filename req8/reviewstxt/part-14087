When we were ready, a sales rep was ready for us and we met Terry. He was extremely informative and answered all our questions quickly and accurately. Anything we requested, he jumped at the chance to please. He even ran around the car lot, in the dark, to find us the perfect exterior and interior colors for us. The only two things we were a little disappointed in was the lack of options without upgrading to a different model car, and the lack of finance people available so we had to wait a couple hours to get our paperwork processed. Even while we waited though, Terry kept us company, showed us around, brought us water and coffee, and showed us all the cool things our new car could do. This was the best car buying experience I have ever had, by far!]
