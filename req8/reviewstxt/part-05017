[109017625946149225114,100423934676303390669,Admission TB100 adult. Nicely set out, lots of info boards, plenty of aquaria for different species. The walk through tunnel was a disappointment (after Aquaria KLCC, no tunnel compares, sorry). We also followed the nature trail down to the turtle pools. What we liked best was the hatchery - a short walk from the main building. Where fish are being hatched & bred before being returned to the sea. Got better views of some than in the aquarium. Also several pools growing corals & anemones to assist with colonisation: fascinating! Nice little restaurant - Sawsadee Restaurant & Bar - just along the road. Varied menu, not too pricy. Immaculate toilets. Visited April 2013]
