[101682823856788733447,100479988302962739838,They have managed my rental property for the last 2 years and nickle and dimmed me at every opportunity. When there is an opportunity for them to make money they call me right away. However, when I am losing money because the tenant is not paying rent they don't contact me. In the latest incident they let my tenant go 4 months without paying rent. During this time they racked up charges on the deposit and made away with more than half of the deposit. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. During that 4 months they charged me to inspect the property and called me to tell me all the things I needed to fix. However, they left out one major detail. The tenant had trashed my property. If your looking for someone to manage your property, go else where because this guys are not looking out for you. All they care about is how much money they are going to charge you. The only time they will communicate with you is when they are making money from you. The level of communication when your loosing money will be very poor. I would call and email multiple times in a week before I got a response. I have never called the office when I have a problem and reached someone who can help me. Most of the times I don't even get a callback when I leave a message so I have to callback later.]
