[101550467299014745818,100308269284886089681,I went to the Gaston County Public Library to one of the meetings. Lots of helpful information. I went to Conner Financial Group for a free consultation after I attended the meeting. Everyone in the office was so nice and helpful. Mr. Conner and his associate Mr. Ratchford were super! It was time well spent and I commend this organization for helping people near retirement. Thanks Conner Financial for all you do for the citizens of Gaston County!]
