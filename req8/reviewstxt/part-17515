[114479146080026558063,101104080731795595954,I received their card from Walmart when I asked about local ranges for shooting, when I called to ask questions about pricing they were pretty rude. But thought hey 10$ per person to shoot, maybe still worth it. Then while attempting to call someone else a few days later I accidently dialed their number. The rep on their end was extremely rude, when I said sorry I meant to dial someone else, they even hung up in the middle of my apology. By that point I was was irritated for being treated so poorly so I called back for a manager/owner. Same rep, told me there was no manager or owner then hung up on me again. I won't be going here, especially after reading some of the reviews, and being treated the way I was while asking about pricing, and services available.]
