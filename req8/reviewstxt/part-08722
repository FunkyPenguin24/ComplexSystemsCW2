[109279011146210574412,100624686113963867474,Love this place - think it is fast becoming my favourite spot for brekkie - the fig and cinnamon muesli rocks and their coffee, well just plain smashing. It's not the biggest place, but that adds to it's cosy factor. Friendly staff, comfortable seating, warm atmosphere, just all good really....oh and it does wine (and I guess dinner, although not tried it) too in the evenings]
