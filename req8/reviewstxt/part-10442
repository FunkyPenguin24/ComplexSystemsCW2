[105338439444207964840,100717581586135375054,The waiter was extremely friendly. The food was excellent, and seemed to be much more authentic than other Mediterranean restaurants. The tabouli had more parsely than bulgar (made just right). Their hummus was excellent. For the price, the portion size is large (we left there with uneaten food). They even gave us some free dates! The atmosphere could use a little work (maybe some more decorations on the wall).]
