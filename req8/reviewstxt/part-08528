[101766526330779979148,100615058189976980673,We love this school. We had the kids at Creme de la Creme for a long time, and recently made the switch. Goddard is a much more calm, engaging, and learning environment. The teachers are fantastic, the owners are helpful, and most importantly, our kids love to be there. I recommend this school to all of my friends and family!]
