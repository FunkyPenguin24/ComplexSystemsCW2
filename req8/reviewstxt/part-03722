[114747948667751290639,100354262552737311366,Blair's is a ripe off. He doesn't pay his employee's. Not as knowledgeable as everyone says. Blair's is about getting turn over. He would rather have new customers come in then have repeat customers. New customers should be aware that he can lose customers receipts, buying your broken tech at a really low price. Fixing it cheaply then selling it for almost retail price. As far as employee's goes, he uses them for their knowledge then, blames them for the crappy work (that Blair himself works on) that was done. I know a few previous technician and all have said the same thing about Blair's. They are all now working for Blair's competitors and is a good idea to go see one of them.]
