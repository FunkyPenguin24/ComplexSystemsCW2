[112483743889304542224,100396558102801341193,AMAZING FOOD!! I have had to travel to Des Moines on business several times this year and La Mie knocks lunch out of the park every time! Delicious food that reminds me of my days in France, helpful and kind service, and complimentary iced tea and bread - it's an all around great place. Do yourself a favor and eat here!]
