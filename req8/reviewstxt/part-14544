[100528082605892190455,100942689741529019560,Over-priced. Pretentious. Booked a party of 11 over a week in advance for NYE, they even called the night of the reservation to verify. Showed up 10 minutes before the res, unapologetically made us wait over 45 minutes. Walked out. Will never go back under any circumstances. By the by, Javier's nearby was sympathetic to what happened and sat us immediately. Better food, prices, and environment.]
