[116341694755884228796,101025734583277548885,FSF is a special place. The clergy are gifted and magnificent. The cantor has a voice which might only be heard this side of an opera house and the rabbi exhibits a compassion, intellect and knowledge of human nature both ancient and modern that makes his sermons - and even just his presence - a life changing and life affirming experience. The synagogue itself is a work of art - beautiful 1920s style beaux arts architecture complete with some of the finest stained glass windows in the New York area. The congregation is diverse and always welcoming. This is a special place and entirely worth a visit. Cant recommend it highly enough!]
