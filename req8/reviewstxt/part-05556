[113770920490882751650,100453867443748417759,If you live in a ground floor apartment as I did, you will hear your upstairs neighbors make a loud unexplained thud every morning at precisely 5:30 AM. You will also, in the afternoons when you are not at work, hear them walking from the front of their apartment to the back of their apartment repeatedly for a period of no less than one hour. You will hear your next door neighbors having really good sex. Your heater will break down in the middle of February and maintenance will come out to fix it eventually (maybe half a day, even if you have an infant in the apartment and it's below freezing). It will work for about an hour and then it will break down again. They will come and fix it again. It will run for a day or so and break down again. You will give up and just buy more blankets and soup. You will, after one year and two requests for a locksmith, still not have access to your storage locker. You will suffer crippling depression and misery after a prolonged stay in these overpriced apartments. Still, washer/dryer in house. Maybe it's worth it.]
