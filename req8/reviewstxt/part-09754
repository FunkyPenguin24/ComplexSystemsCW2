[117403760462028907873,100679788757054981340,GREAT service! I used the online ordering, they called to clarify a specification I had requested, and were on time to the minute for my delivery (which was 5+ pizzas, 3 salads, 2 and orders of chicken fingers). Then, after the very polite delivery man handed me the receipt, I promptly lost it. All of the food was a big hit to our guests, delicious and served hot. The next day, I called to see if I could have another copy of the receipt, the gentleman on the phone was very helpful, had remembered my order, and immediately sent me a copy of the receipt. I will use them over and over again!]
