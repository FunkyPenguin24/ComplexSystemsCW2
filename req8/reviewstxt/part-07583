The fried okra was the most perfect since my mother's (and she died 30 years ago), and the homemade macaroni-and-cheese was so delicious I could have been satisfied with that alone. Shorty (real name Andretta) does all the cooking and her husband Victor does everything else. It amazes me that this little jewel isn't stealing all the customers from the chains that surround it.]
