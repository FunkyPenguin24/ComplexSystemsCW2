[117925356022596305413,100965090494433839820,We have known about this place for a long time ~ we used to boat on the chain of lakes and would stop in frequently! Loved the place, the people, the food! Now we live in North Florida (125 miles away) and are trying to get some friends that ride to head that way on the harleys. We have missed this place!! Looking forward to seeing it again real soon!]
