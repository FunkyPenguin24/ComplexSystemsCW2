[104900467197488567145,100158136457038659302,Although very busy, we were seated quickly and served relatively quickly. The waitress was friendly and attentive. Half way through our breakfast, the water from the air conditioning vent began to drip on our table, even onto our food! DISGUSTING!! We told the waitress who got the manager/shift supervisor. He came to our table, every defensive saying it was completely out of his control. He went on and on how it was a new unit and the repair man had been there. I suggested he not sit people under the vent and his response was that he would lose 6-8 tables if he did that. I then asked him if money is more important than food safety, to which he replied yet again "it is completely out of my control". I will NEVER set foot in this establishment again. I may not eat at any IHOP for that matter.]
