[107794764782505976214,100842266896639822230,I personally eat at Emo's once a week. I love this style of pizza. I get the Lunch Special: veggie pizza (no tomatoes), 1/2 salad, and a drink. ($9.00 before 4pm). I never get tired of this and look forward to my one day at Emo's. And the staff when I go is very friendly, of course they are busy making pizzas to go, but I manage to get their attention by talking to them first. The manager always has time to sit and talk awhile. (He's a very young man and I am closing in on 60 so I am not a young pretty thing someone would hit on believe me. It's just a friendly little place. Since there is NO ALCOHOL, it is a kid friendly place. So take your kids.......for a great experience. PIZZA YEAH!]
