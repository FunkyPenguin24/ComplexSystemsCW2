[103922830082088312736,100256848836930236237,Ms. Julie Moore # 449 helped me a lot by solving my initial problem of looking the right brand of tire my HondaCRV has - Continental all over Muskegon,Michigan - the next day my tire replacement problem was solved after bringing my car just less than 30 mins. The mechanic was Zeller Anthony # 439. Good job by both. She is nice and so professional and knows how to solve customers' inquiries. I am recommending her upward promotion in your Honda business. She is an asset. Thank you. Respectfully, Bernie C. (Ret.) from Chicago, Illinois]
