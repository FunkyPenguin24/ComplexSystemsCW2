[100098649125343687281,101149964179446031760,Don is an honest mechanic. After my transmission was slipping and I had no warranty left on my car, the dealership sent me to Tansmission Clinic. A new tranny would have cost $3700, and I was praying for a miracle! They ran a diagnostic, and checked out my car, even draining the oil to check for metal in the pan. They couldn't find anything wrong, so sent me on my way at no charge. I will always recommend this shop to anyone who needs transmission work. I would never have known if they had told me that I needed a new tranny. This guy is great and honest!]
