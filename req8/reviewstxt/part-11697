[103585741096727024877,100785241217789713919,Potomac Point Winery is an absolute gem, hidden back in the Widewater area of Stafford County. I have been several times this year, sometimes for specific events, and sometimes just for a nice meal or glass of wine. Every time I have left knowing that I would be back. You can always just have a cheese plate, but you'd be missing out on Chef Oz and his culinary delights. Their Thursday theme nights are a great way to try some of the great food, and prices are reasonable with entrees priced around $9.99. (The strawberry-rhubarb pie is simply to die for!) Ask for Johnathan, he's been our server more than once and is always helpful and attentive. The wines are also a delight. No matter what type of wine you prefer, you'll find one that you'll enjoy at Potomac Point. The La Belle Vie white is a lovely summer wine, light and crisp, with just the right touch of sweetness. The Viognier is one of the best Virginia has to offer, in my opinion. Abbinato is a great red, regardless of whether you tend to like red wine - it's a light bodied wine with subtle tannins, easy to drink. If you are a fan of port, the Rabelos port is not to be missed. Rich and full flavored, with a hint of the smoky nature of the bourbon barrels in which it was aged. Whether you're stopping in for a light snack, a meal, glass of wine, or just to look around, stop in and see for yourself; Potomac Point Winery is a great place to visit.]
