[114722687254914175263,100744733877278596282,Dr. Hanson and his team are far and away a professional and caring staff. They are concerned with the total health of each patient and have a level of professionalism and competency that is rarely seen nowadays. I was treated for ligament damage and had all of the information I needed to help myself become healthy again. They have an amazing way with their patients and I would recommend them to anyone I know for total health recovery, not simply good posture.]
