[110862256378135359161,101007392820559363070,I have had serious credit problems and have managed to get my finances repaired. I had found a small house within my income level and went to several mortgage brokers to see how I could get financed. They were discouraging and things looked bad for my hopes of buying a home. I had heard about Mandi Feely Swain and decided to give it one last try. I’m glad I did because she listened and helped me find a mortgage plan that worked with my new credit situation. I will get a home, a mortgage and terms I can live with thanks to her. I’m glad I persisted in searching for the right mortgage broker.]
