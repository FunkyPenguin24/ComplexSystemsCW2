[106531544404447106999,100242587790208047138,A very homey greasy spoon type place to eat joined to 44 truck stop. It's usually pretty quiet, they have free wi-fi, a couple tv's, and very nice waitresses. We're almost known by name down there by now, and our favorites are the burger and truck stop chips. I tend to be partial to the mini corn dogs and chili cheese fries, but there is also a wide array of home-cooked type foods. They've always got a good selection of cake for dessert. They run specials all the time too. If you're hungry in the middle of the night in this area, it's about the only place to go, but it really hits the spot.]
