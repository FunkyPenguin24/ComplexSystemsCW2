[112995795453925649647,100128683702803660563,I've been going to Image Nail Spa for a few months now. I only went there a couple of times under the previous owners. There has recently been a change in ownership and the new owner, Timmy Nguyen, is awesome! He really looks out for his customers. He wants his customers to enjoy their visit and relax. They even serve beverages while you get a pedicure (soft drinks and wine). They keep the salon very clean and take great efforts to sterilize the tools, etc. I highly recommend going there!]
