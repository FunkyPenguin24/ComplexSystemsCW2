[101783658527585373968,100638491992892610823,I began searching for a new vehicle for myself about 2 months before i visited Baker. I went through many other dealerships, all proving to be unsatisfactory compared to my experience at Baker. When you walk into the dealership you're greeted warmly, and quickly by a number of qualified staff members. You're immediately assisted by a helpful staff that asks questions and finds your needs before finding a car that fits you. The dealer I was helped by, Ronnie, was extremely nice and very pleasant in his assistance of myself and my family. He answered all of our questions honestly, and without hesitation. He never once attempt to 'bs' us. Everything was straight to the point, honest, up-front, and most importantly very helpful. The buying process was quick and painless. They helped us out tremendously on the price of the vehicle without pulling any shady maneuvers. I wouldn't imagine that after 2 months of tirelessly looking for a dealership that would be even decent, we'd stumble across a family-owned and operated establishment that really cared about our car buying experience as much as we cared about it. I would never go anywhere else without going back to this dealership and I can't emphasize enough how exquisite our experience was.]
