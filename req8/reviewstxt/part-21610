[109125354001921170244,100145809557603744259,Had A Great Experience At Plaza Lexus thanks to sales professional Nick Jackson and his support team. I had been shopping for a pre-owned RX for some time. On a whim, I decided to stop in and was greeted by Nick. Not only did they have the car that I wanted in stock, but it had low mileage, new tires, and was Certified - all for a price at was lower than what I had been quoted for vehicles in lesser shape (an not certified). Nick made sure that they car was well detailed. The finance manager got me a great deal and the used car manager bent over backwards to make sure that I was happy - both before and after the sale. Overall experience - GREAT!]
