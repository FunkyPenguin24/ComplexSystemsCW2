[100475445248419896312,100908287242332165843,Nitin came by today, on very short notice (I called him yesterday), and despite the fact that a snowstorm hit overnight, arrived earlier than expected. He and his colleague did a great job. I couldn't help noticing the high-end sweeping device, which Nitin informed me is much more reliable and effective than the old-style interconnecting poles that I remember from my youth. They left the place even cleaner then they found it, and Nitin also took the time time to find a piece of masonry to prop open our draft with, and he tightened up the fireplace facade. As if all of that wasn't enough, his colleague informed us that our rug was hand-stitched and not machine-made. I kid you 'knot'! Couldn't recommend Chimney Chief enough.]
