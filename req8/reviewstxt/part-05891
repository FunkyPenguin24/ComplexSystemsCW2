[100070002386404281044,100471333976643202739,I searched high and low for a FJ Cruiser in Tampa that I felt was a fair deal. After dealing with private owners for over a month with no success, I called David Keller at Stadium Toyota and was surprised at the deal that was given to me on the first call. I sold cars for over 5 years and am very aware of the games some dealerships will play. But Stadium Toyota is a five star dealership, they cut straight to a fair number on a great FJ Cruiser that I was happy with. Thank You David Keller and Stadium.]
