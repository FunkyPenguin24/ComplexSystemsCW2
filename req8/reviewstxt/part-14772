[113361574562371326074,100954516569961808550,Never been to this Value Village but I have been to many and they have 1 thing in common. They have someone elses lightly used things for cheep. Everyone can afford to buy that extra sweater or jacket that ekeps them warm when they would other wise be cold. Buy that suit/dress that gets you the new job, you still have enough $$ for a can of beans and loaf of bread. Good thing you didn't spend that to pollute our air driving from store to store to find that awesome sale that is out of your size anyways and no rainchecks...LOL nokidding. Remember you can't find that shirt you loved or pair of jeans that is no longer being made at Walmart or Bootlegger. So if you don't want to shop there don't but keep your opinion to your self if you don't shop there because you think your to good for second hand. And I hope every1 keeps donating their clean and gently used items. remember its not a dump. they can only work with what they havebeen donated so don't expect to only see the most $$ brand names they have some from each and every price range.]
