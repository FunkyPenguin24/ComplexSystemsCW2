[110922037587249576918,100234735087433545475,JCM Custom Homes has been assisting my wife and me for the last 4 years. He helped us customize our Kitchen, redesign the living area, helped us design and finish a workshop. When our Cupola required replacing he recommended a skilled craftsman to build a replacement. We followed his recommendation and the work provided was excellent. All work was completed in a timely manner and as per the proposed cost. He ensured all work was done in a professional manner to include the after project cleanup. We are very pleased with Justin's work and would highly recommend him and JCM Custom Homes any time.]
