[100499151193912196240,100763125401213039242,Stayed there 3 nights and I loved it! They have great customer service. All the employees treated me with great respect. The food was delicious but it was pricey. They only have valet parking which is about $20.00 a day. I would come back again. Thank you for the great experience Fairmont!]
