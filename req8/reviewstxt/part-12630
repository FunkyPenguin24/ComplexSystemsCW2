[117954788926920724562,100835510248332748326,Can't say enough great things about this place. I had just gone to get my eyes checked this morning, after a lazy 5 years of not doing so, at a different optician who prescribed me very expensive Astigmatism contacts for each eye. I had only called this place to check if they had them in stock and the price, just to shop around a bit since they were so pricey. I spoke with Floyd on the phone and after a short chat he invited me down to help me find the right contacts. After he spent some time with me checking my eyes again, he explained that I would actually be fine with regular contacts and had the perfect fit the first time i tried them on. He ended up saving me about 150 dollars, and didn't even charge me extra for spending the time with me and being so extremely helpful and informative. You can really tell that they are more concerned about your eye health and the perfect prescription rather than making another quick buck. I will keep going here as long as i need anything for my eyes. Thanks Floyd!]
