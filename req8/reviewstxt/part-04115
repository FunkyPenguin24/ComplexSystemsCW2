[105123720363489967958,100376242235406590583,I really like Altamont Gardens, just outside Tullow in Carlow. I only rate it 4 out of 5 because I think it's a total shame that the house is not open to the public. Aside from that it's a great place to relax and stroll around. Beautiful gardens any time of year.]
