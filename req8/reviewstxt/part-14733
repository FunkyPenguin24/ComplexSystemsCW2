[102551740559464688534,100952278069674725059,I recently enrolled my son into kindergarten last fall. I have had good communication from the teachers and staff thus far about the progress of my son and he is doing great. I have seen the school staff go above and beyond what could be expected to make sure that my child and others are safe and not hungry, both in and outside of school. As a result I have witnessed many who love to come to school and they thrive as a result.]
