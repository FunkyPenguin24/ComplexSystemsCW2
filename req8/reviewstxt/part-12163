[105536946949651314395,100809528186836524922,This is the kind of dentist office that would rather lose patients than reschedule an appointment. Literally. I was a first-time patient who tried to reschedule my appointment because of a work conflict. They told me that if I cancelled they wouldn't give me another appointment. So I cancelled my appointment and walked across the street to another practice where I am now very happy. That logic might work if there weren't MORE THAN FIVE other dental practices in that 1/2 mile radius on Angell Street. You're just losing business. Not impressed.]
