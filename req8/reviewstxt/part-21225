[114645932387428363689,100124352583021964049,If there was a rating on here less than poor, that is what I would have given them. I purchased a 1997 Audi A8 Quattro and within a week, the window motor went out and it sprang an oil leak. After a lot of fighting and waiting around their office, they reluctantly agreed to fix my window motor but would not fix the oil leak, even though it was still under warranty. Upon recieving my car back after the window motor replacement, i found out that my electronic locks on my door did not work because the mechanic they use had messed it up during the installation of the motor. I have now owned it for a little over 4 months and now the car has a misfire as well. After deciding I would give them another chance, I took my fiance in for a purchase of a car and every car on the lot had multiple things wrong with them and they wanted atleast $1,500 over KBB value and very high interest rates on loans. I WOULD STAY FAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRR AWAY FROM THIS PLACE. The owner (Thomas) is very sneaky, pushy, & dishonest. Don't say I didnt warn you!]
