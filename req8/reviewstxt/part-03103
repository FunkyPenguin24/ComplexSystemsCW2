[102707575428071440122,100320021976820080344,Please read: Everything was great, but was overcharged on the tip (paid with debit). Total bill on the receipt was $31.68. I left a $7 tip. When I checked my bank records a few days later I was charged a total of $72.68. The tip added to my bill was $40.68. It's odd that it was such an odd number. They refunded me in cash which is also strange. I'm not sure if this was just a mistake, has this happened to anyone else???]
