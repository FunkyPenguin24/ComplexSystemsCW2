[105521604223338536010,100220404707877377624,Terrible customer service!! I called for 2 week trying to make reservations for an event and I was either told to call back in 30 minutes due to the reservation book not being there or that I would get a call back, that never happened. The guy on the phone was very rude and kept telling me I was mistaken on my facts. I asked to talk to his supervisor, he then told me the supervisor is his sister and told me the conversation was over and then up on me!]
