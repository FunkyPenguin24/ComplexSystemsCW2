[102254443223488152086,101146916452823352901,Based on the very high number of 5 Star ratings we saw on the internet, we chose to stay at the Mariners Cove Motel a year ago in April 2013. We were shocked at what we found there. The place was truly an old rundown dump! Rips in the couch, cigarette burn marks on the sink and bathtub, sliding windows rusted shut, no telephone or radio in the room, the headboard had a huge wear mark from years of people leaning against it, no washcloths, dead bugs filled a lamp fixture, no soda or ice machine, the door to the office was missing, very old electrical outlets, holes in the carpet, the room smelled like old cigarettes.... I could go on. It was very obvious that most of the 5 Star ratings were fabricated - probably by the owners. Many of the ratings also commended the office manager Raj (but how did they all know his name? He didn't wear a name tag.) I reported these findings to TripAdvisor and asked them to investigate the very high ratings, but nothing changed. Perfect ratings continued to pour in. Not 3 stars or 4 stars, but always 5 Stars! How could such a dumpy old hotel continue to get such high ratings?? Fraud. Now it is gone, people are dead and arson is being investigated. We shall see what develops.]
