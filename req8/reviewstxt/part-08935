But in the end you realise that the motto of the restaurant is if you have money you are allowed to do all things coming in your mind! I was a witness of situation when a company of drunk people yelled in Russian and used a lot of dirty words and nobody of security guys stopped them, sincerely they tried to do it but failed very very soon. So all that evening passed through that drunk company's yells. Also you should note it's more trendy place where some people arrive to show themselves (usually not very intelligent). Cuisine is good enough, but the value is for sure overpriced. Our waiter was really good guy who showed very high level of customer service. But security issue also should be taken into consideration, so for service is 1 of 5. Unbelieveably rude house manager, indifferent wait staff, vending machine food. Don't waste your money here, no matter what its previous reputation times have changed, it is awful.]
