[107845489032757348316,100331615370267593979,I'm not a lover of Chinese meals, but those from Everest are nice enough to eat. One issue I do have is the Beef. It is always under cooked, and takes effort to chew. As a family run restaurant, the atmosphere, and friendliness of the staff, is excellent. Although the restaurant is usually empty of customers, and the decor is simple, do not let this put you off having a meal there. A quiet meal for two would be ideal.]
