[111880393521217537353,100599245433320515942,We ate at this restaurant last night for the first time. The food was EXCELLENT. This Chinese food was prepared with a Master Gourmet Chef's mentality and attention to flavor. Everything was freshly prepared and wonderfully flavored with fresh vegetables and ingredients. I had the Shrimp w/ Cashews, steamed rice, Wonton soup, egg rolls, and cheese puff. My girlfriend had General Tsao's Chicken, fried rice and egg rolls. I might add that I had a Dr. Pepper that was really good...old school good. Portions were more than adequate, and there was enough left over to take some home. The staff that served us was quick, courteous, and diligent. The caf√© is relatively small, as cafe's are...but is able to seat maybe 30-40 people, it is very neat and clean. We witnessed a brisk call-in order business as well. We definitely will return to this restaurant either as part of the dine in crowd, or as one of the many who phone ahead and pick it up on the way home. While there is no delivery service, any inconvenience this might cause is quickly erased by the food that is definitely worth the time and trip to get.]
