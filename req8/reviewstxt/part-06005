[110880119790266378924,100477557586353633149,My girlfriends car was reposed this morning at 4:30 a.m. The car bill was under a bankruptcy order. You violated this agreement for one. She recently lost her father and lost part of a leg in addition to dealing with a son with cancer. In effect, they left us high and dry in already difficult times. Morally and ethically they totally lack in their policies. You will be hearing from me real soon and you will make this right or be in court for the rest of your natural corporate life.]
