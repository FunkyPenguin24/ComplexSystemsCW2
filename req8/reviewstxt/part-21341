[102173444074431978817,100131185061050191020,I brought my vehicle in on June 13, 2013. I had to call and reschedule from my original date so I called that morning to confirm that my Living Social Coupon was valid. The woman who took that call assured me all was good. She made no mention of any other fees either on the phone or when I dropped my vehicle off. When I got to the location I handed her my coupon and they took my car back. When I came to pick up my vehicle the same woman who was there when I dropped it off told me I owed $90.00 on top of the coupon because my coupon was not valid since I changed my appointment. Now that coupon was for a service and not a gift certificate. I expected to receive that service that was listed on the coupon as I called ahead to make sure they would honor it. Again, they made no mention of any other fees being due when I dropped my vehicle off. I then e-mailed the manager and got a response back that the scheduler did indeed let me know that the coupon was not valid for the service I was having completed. I left pretty upset and will not be going back.]
