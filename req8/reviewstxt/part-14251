[111730056881912039550,100925728590564341123,My boyfriend went there looking for help to fix our fridge, the guy sold him a part for $50, did not work. Then I called them and they came to "fix my fridge", they charged me a total of 190 more dollars. The refrigerator worked for one week and broke again. I called them again since they said it was guaranteed, so I thought they would not charge me again for the "trip". I ended up paying $222.00 for them to fix another part. Today I am totally upset because a month after they first fixed it, it is broken again. I think there is something shady there. Don't call this people ever, they will keep messing your fridge or whatever appliance and take your money.]
