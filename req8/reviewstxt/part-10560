[113953791375866856741,100723771742434532537,Everyone! Stop fighting and listen to me! Yes, maybe this place closes at ten, and yes, maybe Sheila was glued to the computer! But there is so much more to this place. This seller of fine nectar, this haven for the unwashed! We must unite our forces under the flag of the Big Rock, under the sterling flames of the Coors Light! Brothers! Do not fight, do not raise your voices in anger, but harmonize in the love of fermentation! Drink with me and celebrate the glory of liquor, the triumph of booze! Do not succumb to the teetotalers but raise your hand in celebration! Here's to you, Royal liquor!]
