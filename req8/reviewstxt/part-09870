[116289276802601184187,100686094057659688595,I currently live here and could not be happier! Everything has been first class since the day I moved in six months ago: the customer service from the staff, the grounds and landscaping, the work out facilities, pool, business center, the view from my apartment... even the size of my apartment! I can fit more furniture in my one bedroom here than I could in my old two bedroom. I feel so safe walking my dog at night because I frequently run into Joe, one of the several security guards who lives here and walks the property every hour of every night in uniform! Also, the North Hills Security guard patrols the property in his squad car every hour as part of his normal route. My dad loves how safe it is! The maintenance staff is incredible, too. During the snow in January I saw them outside all night shoveling snow, scraping ice and spreading salt to keep the area safe. I was blown away! I really love living here and do not plan on going anywhere anytime soon.]
