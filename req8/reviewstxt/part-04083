[113995196780696483193,100374069062940413935,On the weekend, a friend bought the Gluten Free Seed Rolls, for me when we went to their place for a meal. They were FANTASTIC, just like real bread. I live on the other side of town, so I will have to wait to sample the cafe. So teh score is just for the rolls]
