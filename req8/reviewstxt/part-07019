[102887848766344110550,100533245627754814482,We went in today to look at (and potentially purchase) a new Nissan Pathfinder. We already own a Nissan Altima and really like it. So we decided we would buy another Nissan. The initial sales guy, Joe, was really good. He was very easy to talk to and didn't pressure us at all. It wasn't until we met with the manger, Mike J, that everything went downhill. Unfortunately Joe lost the sale because of Mike and I will never return to Larry H Miller Nissan Mesa because of him. To sum it up, when he walked up, he immediately told us that we would only pay sticker price for the Pathfinder; no one ever pays sticker price. He also told us that there were no Pathfinders on the lot and this was why sticker price was the best deal. Joe had told us there were 17 on the lot. When I got home, I verified on their online inventory that they had 17 Pathfinders. So bull on this too. Every word out of this guy's mouth was a lie. He indicated that the only way he would talk to us was if we would be buying right then and there with no questions or haggling. When he was done with us, he told us good bye and didn't even give us a chance to say anything before he turned around and walked away. Because of Mike, I will never return to or suggest Larry H Miller Nissan Mesa to anyone. If this is the attitude of the managers, I can only imagine what the rest of the buying process or even service at this place would be like.]
