Her crablegs were skinny and there was not much meat in them at all. My crabcakes should have been called hamburger-helper cakes. There was so little crabmeat in them that they fell apart by themselves, so what came on my plate looked like a pile of crumbs. It tasted like that too. I had a glass of white wine: here is a hint: add some lemon juice to the cheap white wine.]
