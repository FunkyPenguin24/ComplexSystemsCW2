[101004826541761597302,100515615183324196458,There is no hill, quite like Hill 88. Out of all the hills I have been too, and I am quite the hill enthusiast, this hill ranks in my top 10. It could easily be among the top 5 even, maybe even outranking Hill 345 in southern North Carolina. The point is, this is one hill you cannot miss.]
