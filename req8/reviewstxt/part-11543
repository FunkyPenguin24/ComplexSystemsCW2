[101615384860907457597,100775989591318029573,Stayed there for 2 nights during my last business trip to KL. Compared to my default hotel the "Shangri-La" it does not provide the same quality of service and accommodation. The furniture in my room (#2625) looked quite used. Room was of decent size. The restaurant served a good choice of different foods. But still a good choice if Shangri-La is fully booked;-)]
