[100040522459252485556,100356063737597943464,The only thing that really makes this place good is the convenience. It's in the unpaid area of the NJ Turnpike and it's right on the NY/NJ buffer zones for cross-state stops. Otherwise, the food seems more Microwaved and the beverages seem like they're water with a bit of flavor and more watered down in the end. Fuel prices are average but way lower than NYC. If it can wait, find a local petroleum station. It's only for the better.]
