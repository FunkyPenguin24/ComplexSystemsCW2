We went on Saturday which is typically very busy, we waited about 10 minutes while the host ran around saying she would be right with us, she took our name and said she would get back to us... at least 4 to 5 parties left because the wait was 45 to an hour! 10 minutes later she said it would be another 30 minutes! 50 minutes are you kidding me; I have never waited even on a Saturday to eat here! She also was telling people that the kitchen was backed up and that it might be a while till you got served! WOW I am going to miss those Potato Chips!!]
