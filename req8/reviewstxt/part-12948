[111863742577067235243,100854167381065938733,Went once and received poor quality food (burnt pizza crust, hair in the salad). Gave it one last try a month later, and waited forever for a simple order of 2 slices of pizza, with almost no one in the restaurant. Seriously? And, once again...burnt on the bottom of the crust to the point of making it inedible. Fool me once...never again. The wait staff was trying, but the folks cooking the food need a review on how to bake a pizza. Done going there, and will take my business elsewhere. Just didn't cut it with me. To the reviewer below who said it was "the best pizza in NC..." I feel for ya...you obviously haven't had very good pizza.]
