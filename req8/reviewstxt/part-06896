They do play Christian music quietly over the sound system, but that is to be expected since they are a Christian based company. If Christian music is not your thing, then earphones and an iPod would be a super simple solution for you. The coffee is great and so is the food and atmosphere and the service is super friendly. I love spending time here.]
