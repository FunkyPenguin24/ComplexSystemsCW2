[104916172753568982274,101137503875762450424,I would think twice before going here. I went on my first visit and they asked me to pay upfront 800 then i go back asked me to pay another 750.00 and no work done, The day I got my parcial and upper teeth it was awful i cried so hard and dont know how im going to work until they fix it. I looked like a freak still do. My family came to get me and they were very upset my son in law asked who did this to her is this a joke. They also called the cops on us cause they did not want the customers to hear what they did or see. I wear a scarf now until this is fixed which they say will be a month I have never got this kind of service anywhere and again they are paid up front. Be leary of any dentist who asks to pay up front ... please consider going to a private practive this also happen to another friend of mine from work. I regret going here and am very sad and embarrassed !! I will let you know if they fix it. If i could I would post pics of my teeth. My top lip sticks out and i have huge GUMS looks like teeth from halloween. BTW the dentist was laughing]
