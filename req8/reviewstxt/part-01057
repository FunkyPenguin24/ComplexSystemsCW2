[108871131312893295596,100213686997741068812,We went to Regal after many years of great service at Manito Vet. The small office is very personable and all staff are generous and helpful. All questions, options and decisions are discussed and there is no pressure to do a procedure,( for instance on my very old Westie) They are good with follow up]
