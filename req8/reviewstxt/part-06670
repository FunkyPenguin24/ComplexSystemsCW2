[100613920816967870042,100514856060027528238,I recently contacted this shop looking for the BLAKROC album on vinyl. While the other stores (3) around town only checked their physical inventory, Eric (learned the owners name via email exchanges) took the extra step and contacted his distributor to see if they could locate a copy of this 2009 album at that higher level. Even though we did not have any luck with that route either I was still impressed that they even made the inquiry. They will be my first call next time I am on the hunt for a piece. They get a five star rating for customer service!]
