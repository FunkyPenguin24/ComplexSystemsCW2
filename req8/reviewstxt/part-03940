[117208844559587950086,100365995207009867158,I took a Search and Social Media Marketing Strategy course at Salford Business School last week and I thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone interested in growing their online presence. The balance between learning new practical tools and tricks and setting a big picture strategy was brilliant, just what I needed. Since the course I have implemented many of the things I leant on the day and genuinely can see the results already. Strongly recommended.]
