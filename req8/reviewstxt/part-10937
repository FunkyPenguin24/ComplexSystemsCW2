[107631584205841343267,100743823333187586934,I've been going to The Pork Shop for over 7 years and have never had anything but a stellar experience. I've organized events that required hams and this shop really delivered. They even gave me recipes to make the event go better. My kids are in love with the snack sticks, and so am I since they don't make a mess in the car. My personal favorites are the green chile snack sticks, flat ham, jalapeno bologna, and green chile burritos. I don't understand how someone could give The Pork Shop a poor review. I saw someone say they bought a pork bone for a dog and blamed the store. Seriously? If you know so much about dogs, why not blame yourself? BTW, the issue has always been with bird bones. Also, I saw it mentioned that the service is "snippy". That couldn't be farther from the truth. I feel like family when I'm there.]
