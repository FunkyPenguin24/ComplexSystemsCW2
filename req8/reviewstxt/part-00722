[117587149627116704063,100197365976558898458,Dr. Gondi is an excellent dentist. I have been using his services for almost an year. He really takes time to do through examination and explain the issues in simple language. He is very efficient in the procedures he does and I never had any 'painful' experiences I had with my previous dentists. I take my 5 year old and 3 year old kids to him as well and they always are treated just like kids have to be with lot of patience and careful attention. I wouldn't hesitate recommending Dr. Gondi to my closest friends.]
