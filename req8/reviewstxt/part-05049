[111372126264749872384,100426301119464015711,I recently brought my Lexus in for new speakers because my amplifier got fried and when I installed a new one, I noticed many of the speakers were blown. I initially when to a competitor and got the feeling that I was going to be sold something that wasn't quite going to meet my needs. The guys at ME picked out some nice Pioneer speakers that fit my car perfectly. I liked the sound and decided to replace my Nakamichi unit with a new Pioneer that supported Pandora and Blue Tooth so I could play music stored on my phone. The unit was installed but there were issues getting my subwoofer to work with the Pioneer unit. They added a amp for the subwoofer and all I can say is I was blown away by the sound. The combination of the equilizer and the additional amp made a huge difference. I can't express how pleased I am with my purchase. I recommend ME very highly!!!]
