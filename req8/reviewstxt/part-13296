[112419613007734151346,100873968657098243137,My experience with Gophermods has been amazing. I am a returning customer! My PS3 went out this summer, and for a cheap price they were able to repair it no problem! Also, I had dropped my phone in the toilet and it had water damage, and a purple screen, I thought the phone was done for. I received a phone call from Gophermods shortly after it's arrival telling me that nothing was wrong with the phone! It was a miracle! They kept it overnight to test it to make sure. They could have easily told me they fixed it and sent it back and taken the money, but they didn't! They gave me a total refund! These people are amazing, honest people and I recommend them to anyone! Great great company and great people!]
