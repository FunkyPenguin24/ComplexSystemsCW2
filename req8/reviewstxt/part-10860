[116900720804476978435,100739840703977056544,While staying at Fort Wilderness Campground I had a problem with a leveling jack not retracting. It was a Sunday and I needed to check out. A Disney employee gave me a list of RV repair company's and I called 5, 3 did not answer and I left a message at 2 others, never got a call back. I located Accurate Mobile RV online, left a message, and he called back in a reasonable time. Ben was able to tell me some things to check over the phone. I called him back him back four times and he walked me through resolving my problem. He was very professional and I will keep his number handy. Since he didn't come out to the site, he did not ask for a fee, however I did send him a check, and was glad to do so. I would definitely recommend him.]
