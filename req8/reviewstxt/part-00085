[114370073819148753693,100163261007275345354,I first met Dr. Baker at a social function a couple of years ago. After talking with her about various things that were going on with me, I made an appointment. This was one of the best things Iâ€™ve ever done. I had no idea how important Chiropractic is to good health. Each time I visit, I feel so much better afterwards. Being an older adult and wanting to keep up with those much younger than me, I find my visits to Dr. Baker invaluable. She is truly concerned with my wellbeing and treats me accordingly. I have absolutely no problem recommending Dr. Baker to anyone seeking Chiropractic care. I my opinion, she is the best.]
