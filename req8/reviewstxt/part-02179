[115532511447147526321,100271507317278955258,I went into Matthews with what i thought looked like a mullet that a different salon had given me the day before. I was welcomed by James who told me that it was not as bad as i thought it was, but he would do what ever he could to make me happy. he not only fixed the mullet but gave me the cutest a-line. I have never had such a great experience at a salon. Matthews is definitly my new salon! Thank You]
