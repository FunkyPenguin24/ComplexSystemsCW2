[102578555733535070044,101095807384005343417,Very curious to read the poor reviews here. We go fairly often when someone is ill on the weekends and have always had great service, respectful staff, and good care. One time we waited it seemed like forever - a man had had a heart attack at the clinic - and suddenly it wasn't first come first serve and we had to wait. I understand that.]
