[115584883049995490739,101153803460717553397,Paul's was absolutely perfect as our photographer! Our photos look like they are straight out of a magazine. He was creative and quick. He got through our formals with amazing speed, and yet the quality was amazing. He made everyone feel comfortable and made it all a fun experience. He is truly an artist and we are so happy to have his photographs as our reminders. His turn around time was quick (and he posted a few photos to his blog within days, which was awesome!), and the DVD and prints we received were so tastefully packaged. Our wedding was about 9 months ago, and we are still getting comments on the photos and slide show he made for us! We couldn't be any happier with our photos!]
