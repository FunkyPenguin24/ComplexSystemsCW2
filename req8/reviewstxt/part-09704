[101569567340886908622,100676908412082527169,Don't work at or get your move done with this company. They are by far the worst company that I ever seen. The staff are very rude and unprofessional and the branch manger at the Houston location, Pete, should never work for any moving company in the country. None of the so-called movers or not professional but they are drug user and ex-cons. They will steal and break your cherish belongings. This company bid they jobs so low that it's to good to be true. The reason why they can't keep any good workers is because they pay there contractors only 40 percent of the move. How can someone live with that kind of salary? These guys would make more money working at BK but that would be on BK that I would never eat at. So please avoid this company.]
