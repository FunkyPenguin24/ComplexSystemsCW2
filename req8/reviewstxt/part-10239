[107489407173818784311,100707070533157654927,Oh man do I wish I had read these reviews before I bought a living room set and dining room set here. Their customer service is so mind bogglingly bad I honestly can't believe they are still in business. I would tell the whole story here but it would be WAY too long. Basically they have delayed delivery on my items for almost a month and refuse to cancel the order. Meanwhile I am living in a new house without my furniture. On the phone the customer service was literally less than helpful. I finally had to drive to the store and talk to the manager who for the first 5 minutes of our conversation was trying to blame me for all of the issues. After I finally convinced him that everything was their fault he still refused to cancel the order and said that he could only offer me an in store credit of $50 (after failing to deliver on a $2100 transaction)... WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO WITH $50 AT A FURNITURE STORE!!!!! Please for your the sake of your own time and sanity DO NOT SHOP HERE. As soon as the sale is final they will forget the fact that you are a human being and will begin to treat you like garbage.]
