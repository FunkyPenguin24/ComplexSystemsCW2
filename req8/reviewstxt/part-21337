[108607135223362943323,100131006040906376375,I was very disappointed as a business traveler. My trip was prepaid but when I checked out they charged me for resort fees which supposedly included internet and room coffee. I donâ€™t drink the coffee and the internet at this hotel is not usable. I had to move rooms to get 2 bars of signal. When you call to complain about the internet the Sheraton pawns the problem off to a third party company who keeps you on the phone troubleshooting a problem they are well aware (just checkout the amount of reviews on this subject about this hotel) of for several hours. I do not recommend this hotel as a business traveler. There is lots of great competition in the area with working internet and no hidden fees, just do not go here and save your self frustration and you may get your work done.]
