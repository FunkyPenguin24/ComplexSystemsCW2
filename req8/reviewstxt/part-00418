[112818976555144891777,100180448648433227626,I had 2 vintage Omega watches that I needed opened up to get serial #s and make sure they were working properly. When I called most stores, I got the feeling that they were giving me higher quotes because of the brand of watch. I also read the reviews on the stores that I called and was not impressed. CSS had great reviews and was very informative on the phone. Not only was Scott friendly and knowledgable but extremely helpful and the price was very nice! It's refreshing to get reasonable prices and excellent service once in a while because sadly enough, it only happens once in a while... Thanks Scott! Jason]
