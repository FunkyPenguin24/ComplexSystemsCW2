[101301777382843214418,100071823519421040572,As a first time guest, I was quite impressed with Dermatology PA. I got in and out, and felt that Dr. Ide completed a very thorough exam . He explained himself well, and I left feeling a lot more confident about my skin. This is a doctor who listens to you talk, and gives you time to explain your concerns. The receptionist was also very helpful. I couldn't have asked for a better experience. I will be going back!]
