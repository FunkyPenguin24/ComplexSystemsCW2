[111714265469056990804,100862621159461456605,I had Sales Specialist Joe Feiereisen, and he was with me through the whole process of buying my '03 Honda Civic. He was very approachable and didn't try to take advantage of my lack in car knowledge. When we test drove my car, he noticed a few things that hadn't been listed and added them to the pros/cons list - the biggest being all the corrosion on the engine and such - but he assured me that I could take the car to my mechanic and have them take a look. After my mechanic's suggestions, Joe and I negotiated a price; we both got the price we wanted from the car. He was an awesome salesman, and I would recommend him to friends and family.]
