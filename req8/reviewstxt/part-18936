[107384794612318657082,100002619678093967793,Dr. Garcia is an excellent doctor who cares deeply about his patients. He will take all the time YOU need to discover what the problem is, and will refer you to other professionals to get treatment and/or second opinions. I have been a patient for a number of years and was quite surprised when I realized that no one had offered a review on him. His practice has grown and as a result added a very professional (very informed and up-to-date) Physician's Assistant to his staff not long ago. He has been my doctor for as long as I have lived in the area, and for that I am grateful.]
