[117208844559587950086,100823723991330806965,I am studying at The University of Salford Manchester since 2006, starting as a undergraduate and continuing as a postgrad and GTA. Salford Business School helped me find my real abilities and pursue my dream of doing what I enjoy most in life: business, digital technologies and its application in other fields...As a foreign student with English second language and a cultural shock, the first days were quite challenging but the lecturers helped me settle in and provided the support I needed. As a result I have completed my studies with a first honour degree and numerous awards. Follow to that, I was employed by the University as a KTP and now, finally I am studying my PhD - at Salford!!! I have recommended the University to many friends and family and I will continue to do so..This is a place where you can develop your social and technical skills, find friends and have the support you need!!! In return you are expected to work hard, be committed and ask for help! Fair enough!!!]
