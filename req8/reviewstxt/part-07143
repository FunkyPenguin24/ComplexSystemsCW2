[103084767208513327568,100540181623551489612,I loved their Chinese food!! I moved to Jacksonville a month ago, and I found Wok n Roll. I fell in love at first bit, when I tasted the Singapore style rice noodles. BUT, after my third time ordering from there i found a Huge bug in my noodles. I know Ive them asked to hold the onions, but I didn't know I would have to ask them to hold the bugs. At this point, It saddens me to say that I'm officially disgusted with this place. I will never eat there again. UGH!]
