[116751273624892635883,100427765946445819613,Poor service, sleep number bed was broken, light fixture broken, police were called at 3:00 am to break up a fight... The staff offered a complimentary ride in the shuttle which only departed after the driver (who disappeared for an hour) was located by the staff. All in all, a ridiculous experience. If you're in Providence, find another place to stay.]
