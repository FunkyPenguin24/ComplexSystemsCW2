[103306050896450171539,100155823733303956821,My husband and I went on a random friday and were seated in the lounge which was packed and has a few tvs. My husband got steak and said it was ok. I got a pasta dish which was good but not worth the price imo. The service was quick and accurate but bottom line the prices are too high.]
