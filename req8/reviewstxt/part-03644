[102721503276226671853,100349134843001785820,Tried it for the first time two weeks ago and have already gone back! Our dinners were delicious and properly spiced (my lamb vindaloo had the degree of hotness I like). On our second visit we tried the cherry, raisin naan and although I was skeptical at first, I did really enjoy the flavors. We will be going back for dinner and I want to try the buffet sometime. I recommend this place without reservation!]
