[106756414700479453559,100645307686057346206,First we waited a long time for our food. When it finaly arrived the steaks were well done and not medium as we asked, the vegestables were bland and boring and the sauce bernaise was stone cold to a point where it had a consistancy like warm butter. To top the awefull food the waiter gave us one check even though we explicitly asked to have it split up. When explained we wanted seperate cheks again, he then kept insisting we had not told him to do so. This has by far been one of the worst restaurant experiances i have had. Stay away from this place, I travel on a daily basis and therefore stay in a lot of hotels and eat out a lot, so I know what I'm talking about.]
