[116204844238313086832,101026825913319544862,I messaged Half Dental over Facebook about my teeth. Half dental messaged me back within the hour and let me know someone would be calling me. I was not expecting them to call me and be so helpful and caring. They were sincere in there concern and asked me to come in for a free consultation and insisted I get there that day. When I went in they did x-rays and looked at everything. I let them know my concerns and my income and they had options I was prescribed antibiotics and meds. I realized the time and had to leave to work and they were understanding and asked me to call or come back and talk to them about my options. Everyone was nice and the dentist and their assistants knew how to answer my questions. I recommend them to all who need affordable, caring and compassionate dentist. Thank you for all the smiles you help in our community. I have a long ways to go but soon I will have a healthy smile again.]
