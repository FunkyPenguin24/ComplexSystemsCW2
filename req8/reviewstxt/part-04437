[118306416052438357092,100394405533730988740,Why aren't there six stars? Louise and the team are exceptionally supportive and helpful I have rented for many years through Brices AND let my own property through them as well. Wicked tenant service and very efficient landlord facilities. Couldn't want for a better service. Look at the number of agents that come and go in Brighton and you'll see Brices stood the test of time and turmoil on more than one occasion - there's a good reason for that!. Recommend them 100%.]
