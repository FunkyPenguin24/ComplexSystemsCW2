[105323959807046584913,100355049001359494725,Having worked with numerous recruiting companies/staffing agencies, I have got to say I have had the best experience with the Execu search group. My recruiter (Vincent G.) made it clear from the first time I talked to him that he wanted to get me a better position than the one I had. He began applying me for various positions immediately after I met with him and unlike other recruiters, made it a point to keep in touch with me (even when I wasn't offered an interview). When I finally got the interview, he worked with me to make sure he covered every last topic I would need to go over for the interview, and made it a point to make sure that I was completely prepared and gave tips for the interview as well. After the interview, he gave me feedback based on what he was told from the company. Turns out I was offered the position. Even after I started, Vinny has stayed in touch with me to make sure I'm doing well. I would highly recommend anyone looking for a position to meet with him at least once, unlike other recruiters he actually wants his clients to get the position!]
