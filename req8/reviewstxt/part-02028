[110771112306209970699,100263836471825721263,I've never had roaches, or any other bugs. I've never had a problem with the staff or their policies. The gate works perfectly fine. Sometimes it gets broken and then it gets fixed. Top notch. Great community, staff and events for tenants. It's safe, peaceful and friendly here. The view and landscaping is incredible. Very pleased.]
