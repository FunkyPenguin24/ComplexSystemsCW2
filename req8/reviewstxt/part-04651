[100813399081669856963,100406943138095998360,Horribly rude staff that speak about you and your order in Spanish rudely, if they think you don't understand Spanish. The Manager was running around screaming like a lunatic and throwing stuff in the kitchen. My husband and I waited for 15 minutes of this rude horrible service for our food, and it still wasn't done. Needless to say we got our money back and left. Never go here, the restaurant is dirty, staff is rude, manager is a lunatic, and the wait time is not worth your money.]
