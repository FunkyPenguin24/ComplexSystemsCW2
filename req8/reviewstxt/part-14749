[113562985618597200832,100953195352457377279,First let me say the folks I dealt with personelly were great. That was Kyle, Eva and Shelly. They were great. And then there was underwriting. they were a pain in the ass from start to finish. It took way too long for this loan to close.That is really the only bad thing I had but it drug down the whole process untill I was ready to change companies. Kyle went to bat and finnaly got the loan closed. I would never finance a house with or recomend Quicken because of the slow underwriters.]
