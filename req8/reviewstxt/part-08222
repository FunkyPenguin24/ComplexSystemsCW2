[111794130127901356949,100599840852997529108,Dr Benk told me that I had several cavities and pre-gum disease. As someone who brushes and Flosses everyday, I found this hard to believe. After coming out of his office with a $3000 treatment plan including for something called a debridement, I decided to seek a second opinion from another Dentist who told me I had no cavities. If you want help someone pay for their boat, go to Dr Benk.]
