[100775691857263228797,100090395083275657766,The bear inn is a very nice looking pub from the inside out. The beer garden is lovely in summer and it's one of the nicer places in Street to grab a drink. However, the food is poor. I have eaten here many times and I don't think I have ever been happy.The food is bland, uninspiring and the quality makes me question if they actually have a chef or someone just microwaving the food. The quality of the food at the bear Inn is frustrating because if they lifted their game it would be a fine establishment. Venture to Wells instead if you are seeking a good pub/restaurant.]
