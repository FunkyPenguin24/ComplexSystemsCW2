[100948617837970746790,100967938730920869863,I contacted this company for information on garden pond services on 06/19/2010, asked if I could speak with someone regarding installing a garden pond, which they advertise on their website. The lady who answered the phone told me she has customers in front who are waiting to be rung up and they are looking at her as to why she is talking on the phone instead of helping them. Was I NOT a customer too? After of waiting on hold for close to 7 minutes, I decided that customers calling this establishment are not treated as walk in customers. I have since gotten some very good information calling other landscape companies and stone companies to start my project. Green Mama's - I have shopped at your store many times as a walk in customer. It is too bad you do not afford the same type of service to your call in type customer. Adios!!!]
