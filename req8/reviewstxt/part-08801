[100016456427587481587,100627720356279841462,Facilities typical of older hotel. Were and tear on the furniture; holes in apholstery. dirty. Burn holes in comforter. Heavy smoke smell as forewarned by management. I didnt feel comfortable leaving the bags on the floor. After my stay saw other review of bed bugs and glad I hung the bags by the door chain to keep guests from coming home with me. If price is only consideration, hotel is suitable. .]
