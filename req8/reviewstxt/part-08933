[110138628968719681275,100635098513537402312,My two sons and I have been going to Greater Raleigh Chiropractic & Rehab since 2012 and love it. My older son is a soccer goalkeeper and Dr. Jeff keeps his hips adjusted and aligned and helps him through all his rigorous training. My younger son is growing so fast that his legs just can't catch up with his body. Dr. Jeff makes sure his hips stay adjusted and aligned and he gets the proper stretching so he too can keep up with being a soccer player. I have gone to Dr. Jeff for my neck and shoulder stiffness, migraines and stress. Through my exercise routine for my neck and shoulders and the adjustments that Dr. Jeff provides, I am pain free for the first time in a very long time. Our experience has been very positive with the three of us and we look forward to our weekly adjustments, it just gives us a better quality of life!! Dr. Jeff and his staff are very friendly and proactive to your health and welfare. Give them a try, you will not be disapointed!]
