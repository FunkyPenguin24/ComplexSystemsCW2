[114436118112637293076,100769287941717796588,For the past couple of months I have been getting the best manicures and pedicures I've ever had from Megan at Aziz. Perfectly shaped nails, all precisely the same length. Polish that is smooth with no ridge at the cuticle. I love the pedicure room with clean bowls and and a simple bench--no pounding massage pedicure chair! Megan is so personable and kind to me! She is SO gentle. So worth the few extra dollars! I liked Megan and Aziz so much, I decided to have a haircut there. Jason gave me a fabulous haircut! I have curly hair and it is so difficult to find a stylist who really has a feel for curls. Jason does...in spades! He shaped my hair so beautifully! Plus, he did not push me to color my white-streaked late 50's hair. AND...he was totally amenable to cutting my hair so I could wear my rather dorky barrettes on either side of my head. In fact, the way he cut my hair makes the barrettes look stylish! He didn't insist on blow-drying my hair. He let me style my own hair after the cut, brought me the product I needed, and watched me carefully as I did it...I assumed so he could get a sense for how he could give me an even better cut the next time! If he can give me an even better cut, I will pronounce him a genius! I NEVER write these kind of public reviews, but Megan and Jason deserve kudos and raises. Ask for them at Aziz and tip them well!]
