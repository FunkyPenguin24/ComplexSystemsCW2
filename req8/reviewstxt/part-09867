[116635125720948011038,100685982357014305964,My son and I found this place on a wrong turn but it turned out to be one of the best dining experiences of our vacation. Truffle fries with gouda fondue appetizer was delicious, the flavors balanced nicely. 10oz Filet mignon was seasoned and cooked to perfection, I enjoyed the saut√©ed broccoli although there was a seasoning used I didn't care much for. The service was excellent. The small, quaint dining room was full so we sat at the bar. The bartender who was our server as well was very knowledgeable on menu specifics, Joshua was his name I believe. I would Definetely make a return visit.]
