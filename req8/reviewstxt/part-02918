[100066316975857500859,100309869201151429798,I don't know what the other "feminine impersonator shows" of Chicago are like, but I would skip this one. The "girls" just dance and lip-sync. I go to a great show in Alton, Illinois where there is crowd interaction, stand up and a better show. I was not impressed. Cover is $10 on a Thursday or $15 on a weekend, PLUS the 2 drink min. My drinks were great, but cost $12 each. My mom had a simple Malibu mixture that cost $7 and a cola that cost $4.25 and then they add in 16% tip, regardless of the number in your group.]
