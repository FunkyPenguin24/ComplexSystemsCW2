[106400598890057436318,100450782202916357179,It's all about the crust. Chewy and buttery. My favorites are Spicy Tai, BBQ Chicken, Margherita, and the different vegi-dominant pizzas. Service has always been great and had no problems with getting my orders out quickly. They do heat up each slice which takes about 5 minutes. Other than that never had a problem. Slices are huge, 1/6th of an 18" pizza. Two slices and you're done. Happy hour prices are even better. The only "custom made gourmet pizza" in Auburn. Judging by the crowds I would guess not too many others have a problem. Best pizza in Auburn!]
