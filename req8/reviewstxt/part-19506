[103793903776224921616,100033259474564668067,We love this dental office. The kids are excited to go to the dentist every six months! They love the staff, and they always come out smiling and excited to keep up their dental hygiene - even after fillings! I always feel that they have the best interests of my children at heart, and that is great. We have always seen Dr. Richter, and we love him. This last visit was with Dr. Swan and we liked him as well. I would definitely recommend this practice to friends (and I have.)]
