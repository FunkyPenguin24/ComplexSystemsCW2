[115227427445686471269,100911651653582264188,This is directed to Ms. Lisa Dunn. My name is Serena Gordon and I have been the practice manager for Millie Roberge for 11 years. I have reviewed our records, and see that you have never been a client of ours OR an opposing side. How you came about the conclusions that you have about our practice seem unfounded at this time. We take the grievances from our clients very seriously, and have a prompt 24 hour response policy. We offer a unique approach for our clients here in Clark County with our flat fee system that makes legal representation more affordable and approachable than most. We do that because we have a firm belief is resolving conflict without creating more financial scars, and at the heart of the matter always remember that our clients are good people who have just found themselves in a not so good moment in their lives. We truly are here to help, so if you are speaking on behalf of someone who needed further assistance, I strongly encourage you to have them contact us to see what might have caused an lingering issue, and as to whether there is a legal resolution that could be sought. However, if you are a friend of an opposing side I can perhaps understand why you are lashing out in this manner. We are a very successful law firm in the area, and it is customary to have opposing sides discontent.]
