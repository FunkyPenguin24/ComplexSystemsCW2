[100961556028889646262,100770638400724245857,The fish from fish and chips was soggy and tasteless. The baked beans from the bangers and mash tasted like some beans straight out of the can warmed up in the microwave. The mashed potatoes were phenomenal. The flavor of the links was odd. Not to my liking, but it may be an acquired taste. The service was nothing to brag about, but no complaints either. TLDR: Pricy restaurant, the food wasn't great, and the service was average.]
