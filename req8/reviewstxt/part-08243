[103034695345927424871,100600583069923135673,Luca helped me out with my bathroom tile. I walked into the showroom and he led me through tons of styles and ideas.Turns out they had the oldtime classic octagon black and white mosaic I was looking for. His knowledge (about the tile material to things about the installation I should know) was impressive and satisfying. Aside from the tile, I was able to leave with bathroom accessory pieces for my sink and shower. All prices were reasonable. I will go back to Tiles Unlimited for any future jobs in my home. Thanks again Luca!]
