[102866227155856206528,100969789270857722147,Les was very nice, unfortunately he did not report the correct information to the transporter and therefore my vehicle was refused transport. This company is quick to charge a broker fee and even quicker to not answer the phone because they unrightfully charged me 150$ for nothing. No transport, no service, no secondary transport or offers to still deliver my vehicle, just took my money and refused to deal with me after that... Poor business!!! All I wanted is my 150$ back for them doing nothing, I guess ripping people off and taking their money is how this business stays in business]
