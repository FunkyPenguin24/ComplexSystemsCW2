[109794910923504149634,100060037839184326536,Let me start by saying I am Indian by origin, but American born. My mom cooked Indian food every day of my childhood. I have been to at least thirty Indian restaurants around Boston and this is my favorite. Nice atmosphere, great food, good value, incredible service, and just lovely people working there! My son is about to turn one in a couple months so we haven't been going out to eat that much. If we do get a chance, this is at the top of our list. If you don't have time to eat there, this a great place to order food to go!]
