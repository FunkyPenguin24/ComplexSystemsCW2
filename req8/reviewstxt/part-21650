[104518639133153737901,100147705357210259309,Where do I begin on how awesome Paul was for our wedding this year? Kelli and I hosted our wedding at the Sacajawea Hotel in Three Forks, Montana. We contracted Paul for both his Bozeman DJ services as well as the photo booth. Paul MC'ing our event made our day! We met with Paul a couple of weeks before our wedding day to discuss our plans. Paul was professional and well organized. His documents and explanations really helped us to get a better feel for the wedding timeline and the details of "what happens and when". Paul showed up with plenty of time to provide microphones for our officiant and was really knowledgeable about mic'ing the live musicians (cello, violins and guitarist). After our wedding my wife kept commenting on how awesome it was to actually hear her wedding song as she walked the aisle. At the reception, Paul was clearly in his element. He knew how to stay out of the way but also knew how to step up and keep the event moving. He has an excellent voice that carries well without sounding "cheesy" (for lack of a better word). We hadn't provided Paul with a ton of direction besides first dance music and song selection for a few other reception events. He did an outstanding job of feeling the vibe of our guests and playing a great mix of classics and newer music. Two weeks after our wedding I'm still getting great comments about the photo booth too. He had an assistant staffing the booth and making sure everyone was having a great time with the fun costumes. Our guestbook is so much more interactive that a bunch of signatures. I would never hesitate to enthusiastically recommend Paul and the Bozeman DJ service. Without his services our day would not have been nearly as memorable!]
