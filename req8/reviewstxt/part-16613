[101188635053794485900,101054056433305578644,Master Roberts and Victory TKD staff are amazing. My 7 yr old son has learned more than I can express being involved for a bit over a year! He has gained perspective, patience, empathy, and become more community-minded. If you have had a personal experience, please take it up with the studio, as an adult would. Knocking the techniques, the credibilities, and the man online will not change your already skewed opinion. Please rationalize that this organization has been a very positive influence in the lives of many. I would and have recommended this studio to many.]
