[104108538275129314146,100021325740904556210,Called ahead and I was told it would be about 20 minutes- it was lunchtime so I didn't think it was reasonable to expect 10 minutes.. So I drove there and was done in about 15 minutes.. including a light bulb exchange because one of the bulbs in my brake light was out (only charged $3.50 or so to replace). Very nice and courteous and will definitely go back again.]
