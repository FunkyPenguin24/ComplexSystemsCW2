[103914496634014405617,100657064899958879700,We recently moved to the East side of IC and decided to take our 2 boxers to Best Friends. I'm so glad we did! They are by far the best veterinary clinic in the area (I've been to several in IC and NL). Dr. Vercande and her staff are more than welcoming and really made the experience special for each of my dogs. When one of our dogs, Roxy, became terminally ill unexpectedly, they went above and beyond in not only the care they provided her but in the sympathy they showed to us when we had to make the difficult decision to put her down. I have been blown away by the level of service and care they provide. I would highly recommend them to anyone and look forward to taking any pet of mine there!]
