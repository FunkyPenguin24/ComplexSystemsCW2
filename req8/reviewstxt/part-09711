[117129065370638217010,100677254607076543828,Unfortunately Marvie was only our dog walker for a short few months but it was the best few months ever. My dog Dierks was a rescue and was still adjusting to the good life when Marvie started walking him. She was beyond accomodating when I told her he was unsure about men, didn't like smokers, was afraid of loud sounds, etc. She made a point to avoid the construction sites nearby and avoid the smoking residents in the complex. Dierks also loves human contact and she spent so much one on one time with him. The day she had to return my keys to me (I decided to move us across the country. If I were still in the area, I would've kept Marvie as our walker) I could see only love between my dog Dierks and her. I have a new dog walker out in Colorado and he does not even compare to Marvie. I don't think anyone could love Dierks as much as I do and I appreciate everything she did for him. She really helped him break out of his shell and make him feel comfortable. I couldn't be more grateful for Marvie! I wish she could just bring her company out to Colorado! If you're looking for a kind hearted, animal lover, Marvie and her staff are the ones to pick! They'll spoil your pet while you're away at work. I never used her for my vacations but I would trust them with Dierks 100%.]
