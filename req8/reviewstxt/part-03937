[102195152048710507794,100365908325414513506,We have had many alterations done at Krystyna's in the past year, from a bridesmaid dress for my fiancee, and her wedding dress currently which was able to be sized down from a 14 to a 6! Also, the dress shirt I wanted to wear for the wedding was discontinued in the color I wanted. I found one at a store in the triangle on clearance, but it was 2 sizes too large (18 1/2) and the arms looked like they were designed with a gorilla in mind. In less than a week Krystyna had this fitting like a glove, it was amazing. And her prices are always coming in under what I budgeted for the wedding, and the work is a testament to her skill. I hear people say that when you find a good tailor you need to keep them for life, well, this one is a keeper.]
