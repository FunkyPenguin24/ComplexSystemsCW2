[111007004969167299017,100804899660638769225,I see a couple people had a bad experience, but I can't say the same. I was having a couple of issues with an old jeep and am very happy with the service from Absolute. They may not be the cheapest in town, but the quality work is worth it! I had a ton of questions about what was happening and the items on my quote so Larry walked me back in the shop where my car was being worked on and the mechanic (Jesse) walked me underneath and showed me everything he'd written up. I was satisfied, got the work done, and have been problem-free for a year. That's saying a lot for a 99 Michigan vehicle!]
