[106963206756318173731,101061651107580650171,I had the pleasure of working with Brian Chamberlin while shopping for a new KIA Optima at Kearny Pearson Ford/KIA. Out of the many dealerships I visited, Brian was by far the most professional and knowledgable sales associate we interacted with. Brian's personality made the experience fun, stress free, and enjoyable. He didn't pressure, and was willing to spend a lot of time with me test driving different cars and comparing all the features. After my initial visit, I returned the following week with the decision to go with the KIA Optima. I wanted the car in white, but unfortunately the only white Optima they had was a little out of my price range. Brian and the team at Kearny Pearson Ford/KIA worked with me to get the car to an affordable price, and I drove away in the perfect vehicle, one better than I ever expected to get. I definitely recommend Brian Chamberlin and the team at Kearny Pearson Ford/KIA.]
