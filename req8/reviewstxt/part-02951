[104764416163962547249,100311542140903108334,I was given an oil change package as part of my purchase from Cavenaugh. Every time I took my truck in for an oil change I was told that everything else on their "100 Point Check" was in the green. However, I just took my truck to have some things fixed at my preferred mechanic and wouldn't you know it--my brakes are bad. Not only are they bad, but I needed new rotors since mine were "far too gone for continued use". The funny thing is that last time Cavenaugh changed my oil I asked them about my brakes and the man told me point blank that they were great and still had at least another year on them. That was 4 months ago. Brakes don't go that bad that fast.]
