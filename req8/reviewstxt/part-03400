[116892064098114264269,100335139898179810469,Stopped by for some late afternoon cocktails and I was blown away. The bartenders are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. I let them know which liquors I preferred and what mood I was in and they created custom cocktails on the spot that were to die for. They only have a handful of "known" liquors (Belvedere, Russian Standard, Goslings, Jameson Aged Reserve) - the rest are all small batch. They even have a rye whiskey that they infuse with chai spices that is spectacular. You can't go wrong here.]
