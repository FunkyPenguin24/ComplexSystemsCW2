[118264099179412161130,100684087893105967688,Could not have been happier with Chris's professionalism. Had no idea about writing vows, logistics, or even where to put my hands during the ceremony, and he took the time to walk us through options on the phone, by email, and in person the day of the ceremony. His delivery of our ceremony was impeccable, as was his timing during the "pause for laugh" jokes we wrote into our own vows. The search for an officiant is anxiety-inducing (anyone else have no idea what criteria to look for), so from someone else who was there, highly recommend Chris. Plus, it's cool being married by the guy who officiated Gene Simmons's wedding.]
