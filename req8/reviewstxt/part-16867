[106770302605827332909,101067149418532403553,I was on my way to the Falls Deli when I discovered this little Eatery. Man what a shock....Wake Forest does not have much to say for itself when it comes to a style with food and atmosphere. I had two slices and garden salad, needless to say I could not finish but one slice, they were HUGE. And the sausage was real Italian sausage sliced sideways on my slice with plenty of it. Great sauce and a good quality cheese. The owner went out of his way to accommodate me with my strange salad request. My lunch was so good that I called back and ordered my dinner an Ay Caramba!! A loaded down Taco Pizza to take home, and some Pasta and another one of my salads. Let me tell you this place can quickly become my lunchtime favorite!! Thanks Ziggy's for giving Wake Forest something to look forward too!!!]
