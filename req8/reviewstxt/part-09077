[101427473396235875746,100643145342883803093,Jason is AMAZING. He was great about asking the right questions to find out what we wanted. He was very communicative and available whenever we needed him. He also made sure to show up great houses. He has a lot of insights on areas, prices, neighborhoods, etc that came in handy. One of the biggest assets he could provide though was insight into the costs associated with new homes. He was in the process of building a house himself, and as we looked through homes and pointed out things that we would want to update, he could tell us approximately how much each update would be. As we planned our offers and our budget, that insight was invaluable, and helped us walk away from several houses that would be more than we could manage. He knows his stuff when it comes to post-search things as well. We had a few minor issues come up during closing because either the bank or the other person's Realtor was wrong. Jason found it, and coordinated any issues so that we had one of the smoothest closings I've ever heard of. We ended up with an absolutely gorgeous house even closer to our ideal neighborhood than we'd hoped (with a pool!) for $20,000 less than every other house on the market in our specs. We couldn't be luckier, and a huge part of that was Jason being at the right place, at the right time, knowing his stuff, and moving quickly. Jason is the best Realtor I've heard of, and I'd recommend him to anyone.]
