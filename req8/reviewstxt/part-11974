[100625661789397361847,100799749223503691848,Is there an option to give NO stars? Seriously, I've probably been to every Apple Store in the DC, Maryland, VA area and I'm starting to think that an Apple Store with decent customer service just doesnt exist. Let me first say that I am a pretty patient guy. Even after arriving for my appointment on time and having to sit on a hard barstool that I would've rather replaced with cold concrete for over 20 mins to be helped, I still remained patient. And didn't cringe (not even in the slightest) after they told me that it would cost $150 to replace my iPhone screen and I would have to wait almost an hour for it to be completed. But what broke the camel's back brace was when they told me that if something were to go wrong while they were replacing my screen, I would have to pay full price for a replacement phone! After questioning why problems fixing my iPhone screen would be at my expense,the rep replied with something to tune of "that's just the way it is". So I explained that I would get the service and risk them breaking my phone, but if something happened, I would have the right to go to court about it all. After that, she went into the back for a few minutes, came back out and told me that due to the fact that I may take them to court, they are unable perform the service. I've never realized that we live in a country now where customers are denied service for voicing their rights. Very upset and will definitely stay away from Apple Stores... I suggest you all do the same.]
