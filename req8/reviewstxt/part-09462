[102275281736044996123,100664231644964203431,We had a great weekend trip. All of the staff members were very friendly. On our trail ride, the leader took the time to listen to every little thing my 6 year old had to question about and comment on. She was well educated and patient. The indoor water park was awesome, though the water was pretty chilly. There were others commenting on it as well. The outside water park area was great too, though the weather was cooler so we weren't there long. We upgraded our room to a suite and were definitely not disappointed! The full kitchen was nice; we were able to make most of our meals and save a few bucks. I will say there was some trash left on our patio that hadn't been cleaned before we got there, and the pull out mattress from the couch had stains on it. You saw it as you pull the bed out to set it up. Other than that, everything was great. Thanks for a great mini-vacation; we will be back!]
