[109449134800580292915,100531885030263548125,My husband was the main subs on the job below and was not paid by the work he did by Jack and Lori. Lori is a liar and everything the homeowner stated is true. They bill a homeowner and have material delivered to there home then take it and other supplies to another property and bill them also. They say all the subs are paid but they aren't. They owe is $12000 for the job listed on this site. DO NOT USE THEM THEY ARE CROOKS!!]
