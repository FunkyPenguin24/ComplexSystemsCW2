[108524504066151885572,101096439810651002273,The above poster paid $.30 above other prices. When I was there 7/26/13 and paid $4.59/gal when every other station was charging about $3.60/gal. Half the pumps were broken, I had to pre-pay with a CREDIT CARD, the bathroom was disgusting, and the service was rude and dismissive. I assume this guy jacked up the prices during vacation season because he's the only game in town. AVOID this rip-off. AVOID AVOID AVOID.]
