[116315202744514715785,100725591336712519494,Tony was very attentive to our needs. We told him what we were looking for he brought 3 different models inside for us to look at so we did not have to go out to walk around the lot in the cold and high wind. We decided the Fusion would be the best fit. Tony sat down with us and discussed colors, options, and explained the option packages, in other words to get this option you have to buy this package. After explaining all of this he brought out a car for us to test drive. Tony is a good listener because we bought the first car we drove. Unlike other dealers who get you to drive the most expensive model they have, then try to work your way down to what you asked for in the first place after test driving 6 different cars. When it came to finalizing the deal Tony found all available discounts. Through conversation he found I had retired from a automotive parts manufacturer that is a Ford supplyer, so he called the personal dept. of my company and got the information from them, called Ford a got a pin number and got me on the Ford X Plan for Ford suppliers. I didn't know I was still eligible for that discount. The next day they had us come back to teach us how to use the Sync system. Justin was very patient in explaining everything and very thorough. My wife is not computer savy and Justin was very patient with her and took time to find ways to explain so she could understand. It was a very good buying experience and I recommend Kistler Ford to everyone planning to buy a car.]
