[108535698764148894623,100298679647699396558,Excellent care. Highly professional, courteous and caring staff. I had two dogs undergo emergency orthopedic surgery and Dr. Galesch was a miracle worker! This is the only place I would recommend to someone in or around Frederick in need of emergency or specialized pet treatment. It's not cheap, but that's because they use all the latest technologies and procedures, and the office is well-staffed by caring experts. This is by far the best specialized care you can provide for your pets in the Frederick area.]
