RUN, do not walk. the room looked like it hadn't been touched in 20 years. when attempting (out of desperation) to use the shower, tiles cascaded off the wall in a vain attempt at suicide. I empathized with them. the door was unsecured, so I slept (fitfully, in clothes, on top of the bedcovers) with a chair under the doorknob. sleeping in your car on the side of the interstate is a better option than this hellhole.]
