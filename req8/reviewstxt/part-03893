[106666726024107594131,100363279059271207576,Ordered a Pizza at 4:33. The pizza arrived at my door at 6:54. I call at 6:11 and he told me the driver was right around the corner. He arrived 2 and 1/2 hours after I ordered my pizza. The delivery man proceeded to apologize and tell me that they did not call him in until 6:00. Now if I ordered my pizza at 4:33 and he told me and hour to an hour and 15 min, he knew he didn't have a driver and could not get my pizza to me in that time frame. Why lie? Do not order from this location.]
