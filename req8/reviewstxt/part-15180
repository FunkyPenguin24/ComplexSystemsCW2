[116230447155286650141,100975845847897689324,Justin Pals never seizes to amaze me. I bought a car from him about 3 weeks ago. I was at the dealership alone. A woman, alone. He treated me with the up most respect and answered every question with a smile! I have continued to call, email or see him in person and I usually have a question for him. I am truly amazed he always has an answer. I wholeheartedly expected him to say a few times, I am not sure, let me check, but there is nothing he doesn't have stored in that head of his! Thank you so so much Justin! I love my car! Especially this time of year I am loving the remote start and the heated seats! I will refer everyone to you, Justin! (Love the car washes, XM radio & ON Star too!)]
