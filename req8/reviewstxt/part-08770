[102575031880614464238,100626547891837502333,I am greatly sadden that Dr. Skierka sold out to the Waverly Hospital. I left Dr. Brunkhorst because he too sold out. I feel sorry for Roger, because he can not find anyone who is willing to come into his office without ungodly high wages, which is not possible in a small town environment I dread the health care I will have to seek. I really dislike the big corporate health care places Terri Bertram]
