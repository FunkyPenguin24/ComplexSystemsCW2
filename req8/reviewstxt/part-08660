[105730432942208188231,100621646304216468558,I stayed here with my Grand daughter to attend a Play at the Berkeley Play House. This was my second time staying in Berkeley previously stayed at the Quality Inn. This I believe will be my first choice on future visits. Rate was reasonable the room was very clean and comfortable. This is a good choice.]
