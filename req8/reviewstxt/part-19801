[114148164070892851263,100049732828895024806,Dr. Rob is one of the best chiropractors I have seen. He is very gentle and does not do much as far as manipulating the spine; however, he uses alternative techniques that eliminate the pain I have experienced from previous adjustments. Some chiropractors do the same type of adjustment every time you have an appointment and Dr. Rob is different. He listens to you to find out where you are experiencing pain or discomfort and addresses those issues accordingly. Since moving to Charlotee, I was concerned that I would not find another chiropractor like mine in Atlanta, but Dr. Rob exceeded my expectations as far as chiropractic care.]
