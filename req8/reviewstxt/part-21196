[100499176592736727023,100122689725620245458,As a software engineer I can spend up to 10 hours a day in from of the computer. This obviously isn’t good for my upper back and neck… I always commit to trying to sit properly but to be honest this doesn’t last long. I get very tight in the neck and shoulders, to the point where I can be pain. I’ve been to see Anna a number of times to help loosen the area, which has been very effective. She has also given me some simple stretches to do at my desk, which I try to do as and when I remember. I now see Anna once a month for a maintenance treatment – well worth it!]
