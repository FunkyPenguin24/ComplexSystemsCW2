[101746421907198047828,101103612980566933205,Pros: Good food Cons: Never got a refill on our water even though one glass was empty Dishes and silverware did not look clean. We did send back a spoon that should have never been used. The rest looked like they use a cheap dishwashing detergent that left water spots. Overall, while the food was good, it didn't overcome the rest of the experience.There is better asian food all around.]
