[103024461471755650856,100446732883000466453,Most of the people I've met from Montana since I've moved here have been extremely friendly like the people back home. NOT AT SWANEES... the regulars are a little stuck up and definitely not the typical, friendly Montana people I know. Have been here a few times, the first time it wasn't very busy and we had a good time. Each time after that they've been pretty busy and the atmosphere was horrible. We definitely felt uncomfortable and the service was very poor. Food isn't bad, just your typical bar food. Nothing special. Looks kind of like a dive, which I usually like places like that, but the people treat it like the country club with some of the most unfriendly people in town.]
