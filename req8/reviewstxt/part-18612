[109883890808781518901,101162019297265343937,Very elegant and classy hotel, with the finest touches throughout. Standard king room was a little less spacious than we expected but still very nice. But the bathroom was gigantic! Perhaps the biggest bathroom hotel I've ever seen, complete with a walk-in shower with more than enough room for two, plus a large whirlpool tub. The curbside valet and front desk staff were extremely courteous, helpful and friendly. Check-in was a breeze. The only negative we experienced was a lack of attention from the bartender/server at the bar area (we did not dine in the Palace Restaurant). We went in there twice hoping to get drinks and/or an appetizer and were never waited on, so we walked out and went elsewhere. We were also a little disappointed there was no complimentary coffee in the room or within the hotel. Overall, still highly recommend. Good central location as well...in walking distance of many good restaurants and event centers. Update: Two days after checking out, I noticed a $27.65 charge to my credit card. I called and learned that they had tried to charge us for mini-bar items. However, one of the first things we noticed when we checked in was that many mini-bar menu items were not present in the room, including bottled water. One of the first things my wife said when we walked in and saw this was "they better not charge us for that". Sure enough, they did. However, when I called and explained, they were gracious and reversed the charges.]
