[112382324923057970620,100379600532753717936,I met consultant Joy Fisher at a restaurant in Denver,NC. I am getting married in October and looking to lose weight. Joy explained the weight loss program at Sona and the total cost would be $1,000 or less, which includes blood work, vitamins and 12 counseling visits. My consultation was actually $35 when I was told by Joy it would be free. Then I was quoted two payments of $658 which equals more than $1351. Joy stated this was a deal as she was authorized to give me $100 off. Afterwards, I realized there were unexpected expenses that were never discussed prior to my agreeing to go through with the program, and that because of my wedding, I was on a tight budget and not in a position to fork out money for additional un-expected expenses. I kindly thanked Joy and said I would just try to lose weight with will power. This is joy's response, "I am sorry you feel that way. Really sorry you have changed your mind about getting healthy. It isn't about will power! Hope you are successful." I never indicated I didn’t want to get healthy. I am actually a vegetarian who eats only organic food and few carbohydrates. I’m glad I made the decision not to move forward with this program if the consultants clearly demonstrate this type of demeaning and negative behavior towards their clients. I would like to also add that the website clearly states they are currently offering 60% OFF their medical weight loss program. (Posted by LeeAnn through my daughter’s gmail account)]
