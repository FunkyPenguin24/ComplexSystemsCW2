[112793752928316420328,100828143810196628519,I'm a computer technician myself, but not certified to do apple warranty repair, thus why I turned to Ribbit. I don't like to leave negative reviews, but the service I received was ridiculous. I had to tell them what to do over the phone to pin-point the issue, and even then they refused that my suggestion was the issue. They eventually "gave up" and said all they could do was ship it to Apple. I made a short trip to Haddock Computers and they quickly diagnosed the issue (what I had suggested to Ribbit in the first place) and my computer was finished the next business day. Haddock rocks, call them up any time you need Apple warranty repair. Beware of Ribbit's Apple techs. P.S. if a Ribbit employee is reading this, a word of advice. Don't treat your customers like idiots. Having the personality of a wet pile of garbage doesn't do you a bit of good. Have a great day!]
