[111509591952462113105,100193432123450303753,Dr. Patel, is possible some people can get mad on staff , or delay , but if you really need a DOCTOR he is the best you can have. I am his patient for years and my entire family too. He takes the time to talk to you he is human doctor not robot just writing RX. I believe I wont be alive if was not for his care about my health. Dr. Stu Patel is best doctor ever. Don't go by mis communications issues find your way to meet him and any effort will be compensate HE IS THE BEST !]
