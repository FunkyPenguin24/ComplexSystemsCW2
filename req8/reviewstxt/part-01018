[100495718904128592947,100211846446255997472,LOVE this place. After my dog died of old age, was feeling sad. So I looked on their web and found an OUTSTANDING dog. He is a 4.5 year old Terrier/Westie mix. Fully house trained, VERY lovable, affectionate, GREAT personality. After brought him home found out he can do tricks, solve puzzles, walk backward. When get a bigger place with look for a friend for him. CANT go wrong. Quality animals.]
