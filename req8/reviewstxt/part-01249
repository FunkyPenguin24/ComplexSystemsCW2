[105919964191402227684,100223603816690466371,John at JD's is always outstanding to deal with. Price is always fair. When you think of being without your computer you know how important it is to trust someone to repair it and usually it's fast! He has helped me out of a few critical repairs and a few minor glitches. Can't say enough good about this company. THANK YOU!]
