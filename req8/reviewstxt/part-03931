[105582557240733866619,100365602220784350881,Buffalo Wings & Rings is where the Locals Hangout. The food is ALWAYS great, the people are ALWAYS fun and if you like to DRINK and CHATTER well, this is THE PLACE TO BE with a Mini Stage, Local Bands playing music, Wrap Around Sports Bar taking you through the building from room to room, Outside Sitting Area, and even Car Shows frequently, just makes this place one of the best locations around in North Port. New Years was great. I go here from time to time to watch sports, eat and hang out. Hope you have the same experience as I did when I first came to North Port and went to Buffalo Wings & Rings. Enjoy.]
