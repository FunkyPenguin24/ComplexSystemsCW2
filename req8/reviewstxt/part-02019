[116791434063503640621,100263477593946308759,I really like this spot... the food is good, fresh and natural tasting no extra just good seasoning which I like.. they don't abuse salt like most places. The portions are good and their shop is clean...the 9 to 12 bucks you pay for a fried fish or shrimps with fries is worth it. Hope they maintain for a long time! Yum!]
