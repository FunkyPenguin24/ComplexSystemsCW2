[100475642720067797626,100837113098973000529,I was on vacation and the skis I brought were under-performing. The only store in town that I could find that sells AT and Telemark gear was this place. I went in at 4:30 pm and Doug worked out a great price for me. Rich and Laughlin got them mounted waxed and ready to go the same night. Great service, pleasant people and good selection. These guys salvaged my ski vacation. Thanks.]
