[101904994577632840689,100199828646675311949,This was out last stop on the Bourbon Trail (even though they are no longer part of it). We wanted to see where Blanton's Bourbon was made. I was very impressed with our tour guide, Freddie. He was a third generation employee there and he was very knowledgeable about Buffalo Trace. He also conducted a very impressive and informative tasting. Enough so that we went out and bought products later that day.]
