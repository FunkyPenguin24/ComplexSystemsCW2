[101747156998187826563,100599877679898393119,Customer service has been ingrained into my personality since I've worked retail and the Plato's Closet in Raleigh lacks that entirely. They are so incredibly rude and cold and not personally at all. I always I have a crappy time at this store. It seems to be an ongoing theme in about all Plato Closet stores. It's too bad because I think they'd be amazing if they actually liked their jobs. On that note, they're selection of clothing sucks. They "say" they take things no less then a year and a half old but they will take my three year old destroyed American Eagle shorts and deny quality barely worn Lilly Pulitzer pants that are a couple months old! Their priorities are poor in selection.]
