[100433296057053487722,100694075250737685603,I don't even really like Sushi but their Tempura Calamari is the best!!! I guess it doesn't really count since it's fried, but still! If you love Tempura Calamari, this is the place to go! The only thing I eat here lol. Edit: So, I've expanded a bit earlier this year and their BBQ White Fish Belly and Salmon Skin Hand Rolls are pretty good. I order the HR without the sauce though because I'm deathly afraid. Oh yeah, the value is great!!!!]
