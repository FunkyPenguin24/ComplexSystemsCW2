[101818724507606389568,101025675320536259632,Loved the self guided tour which let you wander around at your own pace and our dogs were welcome too! Also appreciated that they remained open late...after a long drive from Cheyenne and checking into our campground, a leisurely walk around this quaint replica of the old west was just what we needed before dinner.]
