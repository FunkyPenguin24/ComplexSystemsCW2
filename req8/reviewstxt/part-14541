[118099658113193284285,100942562062271914718,I've had nearly had every sushi roll there is on the menu and it's hard to go wrong. Yes it gets a bad rap from some hardcore sushi eaters because it's Korean owned but I can assure you that you won't be disappointed unless you come in expecting to be so. It's a family friendly joint and the owner is extremely nice. Owners personality might rub some people wrong, if so, go take a chill pill, relax and just enjoy your time and your meal. Oh, and Mon-Thur it's $3.99 all you can drink SAKE. And that's $4 for the whole table [4 people] from some time to 9pm. And to top that off, if you buy 10 rolls you get one free. All in all, this place is great]
