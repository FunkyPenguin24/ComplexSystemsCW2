[109285257484118261696,100547539079328446975,The Buca di Beppo in Tallahassee is much smaller than locations that I've visited in other cities. While the food is usually an excellent mix of savory, Italian classics, the service at this location has been hit-or-miss. The first time I went, the service was excellent. The last time I went, I was overcharged and the server didn't kept delivering the wrong items to people in our group. When I brought up the situation to the server, I was told that the menu price must be wrong despite what it stated. The manager didn't really help out on this issue, either. Overall, its a fair experience if you have a large group of people to feed, but pay close attention to your receipt.]
