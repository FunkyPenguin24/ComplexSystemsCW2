[112595368777981762352,100473745520429745455,For the past few years I've been living in a condo managed by Jonathan Beck of Rancho Management and thus far am more than happy with their service. He has been excellent at addressing any concerns or questions I have in timely and reliable manner, even outside of regular business hours. Both he and Rancho have been a pleasure to deal with. Highly recommended if you're looking for a professional management service.]
