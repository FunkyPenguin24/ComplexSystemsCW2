[103117941718748427610,100446732474153883074,Having dined across North America, Europe, Africa I cannot overstate how good this restaurant is. Sara is a true host and made our evening the most pleasant in years. The food was exceptional - beyond exceptional. "Chef's Choice" is a must! Being served an original creation is something that cannot be described. The Creme Brûlée was as good as what you will have in Paris! An absolute MUST!!!]
