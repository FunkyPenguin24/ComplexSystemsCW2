[102759654789363834027,100591368028196719798,Wow!! What a joke... Greg at fast signs of Cutler Bay is a total scam. After getting all my details about my car, I provided the artwork.. He charged my credit card what he quoted me.... then he realized he needs to look at my car... It was the same car we first spoke about, a Jeep Liberty... He tells me to come down, so he could look at the car, then tells me has to charge me $30 more... That was the 3rd time he changed the price on me! This guy should be a car sales man... a total swindler! Avoid this place!]
