[102414973701682888636,100600528254088924203,Randy did an excellent job of selling me my ES 350 (3 of them). He is the quintessential professional car salesman. There was never any pressure to purchase. He explained all the features and benefits of the Lexus. The sales manager and him helped me purchase the Lexus at a fair competitive market price. Randy is always very friendly when I get my car serviced and washed and always asks me if he can do anything for me. He is definitely an asset to this dealership and why I return to buy my cars.
