[114727831724112493404,100677994642954470338,A friend recommended Care Wellness Center a few years ago when my back went out. I have been having back issues on and off for years now and I can honestly say that I have never had as much relief, or ever expected to, as with Doc Whitten and his wonderful staff. I now refer to Doc Whitten as my miracle worker. Not only do I feel much better when I leave the center, I take home all sorts of excercises, routines and tricks to help me continue my therapy at home. A pulll that a few years ago would have had me flat on my back for weeks healing, is now a few days of therapy with Doc Whitten and I am up and about, back on my feet in no time ! The staff is beyond excellent, very attentive, caring and always do their best to accomodate the patient. LOVE this place !!]
