[113529824399178785972,100687669501072708035,I have enjoyed living here so far! The staff here are friendly and attentive (for the most part) and are quick to respond to your needs. If you have a maintenance issue, the maintenance guys will probably have fixed your problem that same day or within 2 days. The complex is in a convenient location as well, down the street from the heart of Carrboro and directly on the J line and across the street from the CW line. The complex is still undergoing renovations however, and that can result in some incredibly loud noises and unsightly landscaping. If you have to work night shifts and sleep in the day like I do at times, you'll find out, it's extremely annoying. The walls are also a bit thin and I do hear my neighbors sometimes. Given the cheap rent though, it's a very good deal for a newly renovated place. Unfortunately the rent increases after your lease ends and it can be pretty steep.]
