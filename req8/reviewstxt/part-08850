[116669475098940414473,100630219693698284737,Please note: The "reviewer" named Cody is incorrect. This is NOT in an apartment building as he claims in his "review"...it's in a retail strip center on the corner of White Bear Ave and County Road C. It is very much a "public" laundromat and you can wash and dry your clothes there regardless of whether you live in an apartment, a house, or in the park. It's open to all. Cody must be confused so please ignore his "review" as it is incorrect. Thank you.]
