[102676742361246637203,101154703006172325933,These people need to be put out of business! We called them to let them know that we were going to be a few days late on our rent. We were paying $1400 per month and we have to pay an extra $220.00 on top of that for a late fee. We NEVER missed a payment and NEVER been late! I asked them for one more day to get the money to them. They told me I would have to pay $750.00 extra on top of the late fee and rent. Needless to say we couldn't afford it. We begged and pleaded with them. They filed an eviction on us and our 5 children and now we are faced with being homeless. These people are heartless and they don't care!! Now our credit is ruined and we don't know how we are going to find another place to stay. RUNNN!!! Go the other way!!! Not only did they mess us up but the home owner too, because they wanted to be greedy. We paid $2800 for deposit plus first month rent to move in here. This was not worth it and now our life is turned upside down because of it. I wish more people would come forward about them. They need to be stopped.]
