[113675920893514949425,100078818285081417010,When we came from Calif to Chicago, (I know people think I'm crazy) in Sept we needed help and we met with Kimberly Evetts. She was very professional, responsive and supportive. She ultimately found our current place and we are very happy with the results. Kimberly is wonderful to work with and I would utilize her service again should we change locations.]
