[110168077263425218023,101017411385144758357,DO NOT BUY FROM THESE SCAMMERS. I was ready to buy a Ford Transit van and the manager Mike says that if there's rebates, then the customer will get them and implied how honest he is. Usually, when you hear that, the truth is quite the opposite. Sure enough an item for the interior which qualified for a full rebate, they only wanted to cover half the cost. They agreed on that , then later came out stating that I had to purchase $1200 of options before the vehicle qualifies for any rebate. Well, the fool, "Jesus" brings me the statement from Ford, which was correct except in small print on the bottom, it stated the Ford Transit did not apply, which I had to point out to him. The item did in fact qualify, but they were lying through their teeth. I was signing docs, when the next lie unfolded--the $1000 rebate he promised me, just went away, since I refused to pay Ford's absurd 6.99% rates. I could go on and on, but I wouldnt buy a bicycle from these bull****ers! Typical used car salesman tactics!]
