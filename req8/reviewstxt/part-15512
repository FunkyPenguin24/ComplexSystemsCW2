The quality is very high. You would never get a steak with a streak of inedible gristle in it, as I have at Ralphs. Produce is expensive but better quality than regular supermarkets. No withered peppers as I have seen at Albertson's. regular groceries you are better off at regular supermarkets. Same products but cheaper.]
