[113575384881976180032,100840267903908169896,Myself and my partner came here last week. And i have to say, the food is amazing! If you want a taste of some real Indian food, then pay zest a visit! And go for something amazing! Don't just get a chicken tika and chips. Select something from the innovative dishes, they really are amazing! We had the seafood platter to start, then i had the Tandoori chicken breast, and my partner had the home style korma. (We always share) and they were amazing! And the prices are fantastic as well! I'd pass on the pub food and go here personally!]
