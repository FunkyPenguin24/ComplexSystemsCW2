[105805437441533144318,100562186124945447155,Phenomenal service and care for our pets! My wife and I couldn't be happier with the service we receive and the loving care our pets receive. Whether walking our dog, feeding our cat, or pet sitting for a long weekend we have always been blown away by the consistently amazing service that NYC Pooch provides. They have always been responsive to shifting walk schedules, training requirements we have asked for the walker to support, and any other one-off questions/requests we have raised. Best of all is receiving a 'pup report' whenever they visit our pets. It is always so comforting knowing what - and how - they are doing in the middle of the day. After 2.5 years of using NYC Pooch, we can't think of a better company to trust with walking and caring for our pets while we are at work or out of town.]
