[100511907176123209529,100126528839555393823,Best auto body shop in New England -- hands down! How many people do you know feel comfortable taking their car in to get fixed? I was one of those people who hated it and always had a bad experience in which I felt like they were trying to take advantage of me. At Rego's -- they have always treated me, my friends and family like their own family! It's always such a smooth, pleasant experience taking my car in to get fixed. They set you up with a rental car that comes to the garage, eliminating an extra step to a rental company (unless you have one you'd like to go to) and, thanks to their perfectionist attitude with their clients (like I am with my own clients) -- they always give me my car back looking 111% better than how it looked before the damage was even done! Part of me almost looks forward to needing auto body work on my car because my car always comes out looking better and because it's like visiting family :-) Thank you, Rego's, for such excellent service! You are all amazing!]
