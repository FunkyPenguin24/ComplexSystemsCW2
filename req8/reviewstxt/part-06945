[103880450896010535213,100530179831843735075,The apartments are okay (if a little old). The maintenance is a little haphazard, in my opinion, and little things (like a broken window in the laundry room door, or a busted sprinkler head) can take months to get addressed. They talk about a "Courtesy Patrol" that no one sees. And they have had at least one case of people squatting in an emptied apartment and that required the Irving Police Department to come and get them out. In my opinion, the current manager (Michelle) is not a friendly person. Nor is she interested in actually doing things for the residents. She is, from my perspective, on some kind of power trip. Why else would she be harassing residents when their occupancy rate is low enough to offer a $99 first month's special? It defies logic. So while the apartments themselves are okay, the staff have enough issues for me to personally recommend that you look elsewhere. Too bad, too. This used to be a pretty nice place before she came.]
