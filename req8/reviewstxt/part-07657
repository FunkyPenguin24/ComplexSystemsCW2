[110300251049609237504,100568498007583714752,They are the friendliest and most professional dental team I have ever seen! They are caring and funny and always put me at ease. When I had an abscess, they saw me right away and immediately set up an appointment with an endodontist. I did nothing! I am so pleased with the front desk staff, the hygienists, and all of the dentists. I recommend them to everyone in the Groton/New London, CT area.]
