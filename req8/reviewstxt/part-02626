[115397947724361701444,100294449856505525829,Wonderful store with quality products, tended with care. A little of this, a little of that. Such a treat to stop on our assorted trips from Ithaca into the east and northeast. Worth the handful of miles "out-of-the-way" off 88 just to be greeted by Kendall and have a nibble of something real and delicious and cup of good quality coffee. Just go...you'll keep coming back!]
