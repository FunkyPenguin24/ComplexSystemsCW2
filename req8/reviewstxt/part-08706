[102873538891032074360,100623874976641607542,After a brutal burglary attack, Evan Willis brought in a crew to clean the bio-hazards left behind. He packed up the entire home, cleaned the items. Removed and replaced flooring, sub-flooring. Cleaned the house from top to bottom. He worked directly with the insurance company leaving us free to deal with other things until he completed. In lieu of a maid service, we have opted to use his weekly cleaning service. We know our home is always clean for company.]
