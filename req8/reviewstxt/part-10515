[109341761140686398579,100721083308397406231,I would prefer, of there is any 0.5 star for this rating. I was a kind of guy to try different restaurants to crave for different tastes ( noted that if they have groupon). So choose this restaurant as I generally like mexican and I fell in love with that taste when I first time tasted at GTO, S Howel Ave, Milaukee. Coming to this one, is horrible experience and taste was so bad that I have deleted this from my list of new restaurants and I would not prefer to any of my friends. I have ordered Veggie Fajithas, looks like prepared way before and re-heated as I don't see any sizzlings on the dish and beans they served with this OMG....black beans..never had this kind. generally most of mexican restaurants will server refried beans and I love that. and finally here is another item Cheese quesdilla another horrible item.. Finally..what I would say, this is place that I would never visit again and will not suggest to my friends to waste their holiday night dinner with this crap.... Staff is good and ambiance is okay kind...but I guess we go to restaurant to taste the food not just to sit inside...]
