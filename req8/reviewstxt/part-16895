[102258337746700678667,101068753314175779871,I applied for financing Friday morning was approved called Saturday to go to the dealership thinking I was going to pick up the vehicle I applied for only to get 2 minutes from the dealership to get a call that they sold this to some one else after 4 hard credit inquiries and an approval for that vehicle. This dealership is full of your typical slimy lying salesman. Buyer beware, would not go back if they offered a free car.]
