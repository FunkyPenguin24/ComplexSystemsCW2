[110678345455272072951,100898411974761728672,I was always skeptical about buying parts from a salvage yard but after talking to them on the phone for a few minutes I decided to give it a go after asking them how many miles the part had on it and they assured me that all of the vehicles they buy have under 100,000 miles. I went in to pick up an axle and differential for my Ford F150 and was amazed at all of the parts that were all in great shape that they had stocked on the shelves. You can get anything here everything from engines and doors to gas caps and light bulbs. Anything you need from a ford lincoln mercury and they probably have it. The guy at the desk told me it would be just a few minutes because they were trying to find the best one they had. Then they found one and ended up taking it back and getting a different one because they didn't like that one. So it was very reassuring that they give you the best part available if possible. The other thing is price. The prices were great. I priced the same part at 4 or 5 different salvage yards and they had the best prices by far. Not to mention all of the other salvage yards were not only charging more, but they also had anywhere from 50,000 to over 100,000 more miles than the one I got from Clays Warford. Also the service was great. Everyone in there was on top of their game. Getting me the part I needed quickly, had another guy asking if I'd been helped. Friendly service. Even the guys back in the salvage yard were crackin jokes with me. Now back to the part, I bolted up the axle and diff to my truck with no problem. Everything was in great shape. Even better shape than my original. It even removed some slop from my driveshaft that was there long before the gears blew up in my old one. Also the brake shoes were almost brand new. I'll definitely do business with them in the future.]
