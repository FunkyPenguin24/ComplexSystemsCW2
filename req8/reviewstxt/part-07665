[113326878473946318866,100568982051093450741,We decided to just start looking at the GMC Equinox. I bought my first car ever at Raymond Chevrolet in 1980! We were driving around the lot looking at vehicles and then decided to go inside and talk to someone. Charles approached us in a very professional manner. He was not pushy, so that gave him our business. In dealing with Chuck we were very relaxed and he made sure he got us the price we wanted. He did not give up with getting us that price. Very impressed with Charles. Thank you we are so happy with our vehicle! Tammy and Dan Dekeyser]
