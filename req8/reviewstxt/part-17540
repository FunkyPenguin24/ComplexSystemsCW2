[108951264888148107333,101105432962062794427,The food we ordered tasted fine except for their Queso dip with Chorizo. Isn't Queso dip suppose to be cheese? Whatever it is, it isn't cheese. Cheese thickens as it gets cold, this stuff didn't. And it didn't taste good. The service could have been better, our waitress was extremely slow. If we hadn't asked for help from other servers I probably wouldn't have left any tip. We won't patronize this restaurant again.]
