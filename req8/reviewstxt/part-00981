[100434999867715088821,100209927406076790695,I loved it! The parking is something to get used to but the store is fantastic. It is cheaper than going to Publix and I love that they have their own brand, which really helps price wise. They have soo much that you would not be able to find at other places. I would recommend going on the weekdays though it can get really crowded.]
