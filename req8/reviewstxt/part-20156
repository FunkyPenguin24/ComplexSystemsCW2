[103116220370098725142,100068473638282877129,This place used to be so much more pleasant. Prices have always been on the high side, but worth it because of the experience, UNTIL NOW. Seems like shady teens like to go there. The ones that are too old to be happy at the movies, but not old enough to drink. As a result it constantly feels as though a fight is about to break out. I honestly like the place, I just dislike the rowdy teens.]
