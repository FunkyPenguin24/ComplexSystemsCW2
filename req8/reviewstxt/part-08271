[101968179154567271984,100602186818845290515,The food is great. Just watch the price. They tend to under-charge, over-charge, or double charge at this location. The price is inconsistent when I get roughly the same weight every day. I don't know if it is intentional or just lack of training or attention. Just watch it, or try another Lee's Deli location. There is one two blocks over and one block down toward market.]
