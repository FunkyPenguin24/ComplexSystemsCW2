[117520675990933782639,100585803079372271270,My husband and I did a lot of research before picking a place to board out puppy. We were looking for a place that was going to care for our puppy, but also be affordable for long stays. Precious Pets is very affordable for the services they include, and we will only leave our Shiba Inu at this place. Everyone there is very friendly, and our puppy is always really happy when he comes back home to us. They let our Shiba play with other puppies his age, so it's really comforting knowing they care!]
