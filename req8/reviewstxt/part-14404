[116892596387278214823,100935213846639201041,Beware: stay clear of this business. There are many other options in the Boston/Lexington area where your business is so much more appreciated. After a couple several mediocre experiences and one bad experience (blamed on large group and assumed they couldn't handle 6+people), I decided to give it one more try last weekend- which, now, I realize was my LAST time stepping into this establishment. On a Thursday night (mind you hours on their website indicate Thursday - Saturday: 11:30am - 10:30pm), myself and two co-workers perused in at about 7:45P for dinner and maybe a couple of drinks (at least 30-50$/person). As we were being seated, the waitress shed a vibe that she'd rather be dead then wait on us. Once seated, she told us the kitchen was closing at 8.....ahhh I get the sour look now. Isn't this the job you signed yourself up for? How else do you make money if you won't seat and feed customers? We then [stupidly] asked if we would be rushed out/could we still order all things on the menu/could we sit and have a few drinks? She gave us a BLANK look and then after much time said well, we have all been here since this morning and we are tired, ready to go home. I looked at my friends and collectively said to the woman as we got up to leave "No Thanks". As we walked out, she didn't offer an "I'm Sorry" or "I feel really bad, this is not how we operate". She only muttered, "well, there is the tavern across the street". Take NOURISH'S employee's recommendations: Vine Brook Tavern in Lexington MA (across the street from Nourish- which won't be in business much longer anyways). We had a FABULOUS meal, amazing customer service and we would ALL be back. I think the rest of Lexington was there too (not too crowded). DO yourself a favor, enjoy the Tavern.]
