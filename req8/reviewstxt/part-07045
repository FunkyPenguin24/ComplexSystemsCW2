[102498803881701480264,100534438429332402053,The sales people are superb. My wife and I bought a car last week from Kyle Defreze, and went back this weekend to buy another vehicle - this time with Jane Button. On both occasions we worked with their Sales Manager, Josh, who was very easy-going and worked hard to get us to where we needed to be. On both occasions we also worked with their Finance representative, Greg Perrotti, who got us a great rate for financing on my Wife's car and did a fantastic job with getting me out of my previous lease and into a new lease! This team is definitely worth meeting, and buying a car from. I would strongly recommend this experience to my family and friends!]
