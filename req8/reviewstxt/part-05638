[117691191189451374283,100458022718002299392,People do not pick up after their dogs at this park. There are trails of woodchips, presumably because it's muddy, but it's best to stick to them, and watch where you walk, or you'll step in poop. Personally, I will never go back there. I don't want my dog running around in unsanitary conditions. When people don't pick up, I can't help but speculate about what else they're not doing in terms of upkeep of their animals. Where poop goes, so goes disease.]
