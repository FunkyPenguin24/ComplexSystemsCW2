[115397624187465360227,100195032461983880830,Angela Moore at SixDegreesSEO did a fantastic job of outlining my options for SEO/marketing work. She is very knowledgeable and was willing to give an honest opinion which in the SEO world sometimes is hard to get! She spent a lot of time with me going through pieces I was unfamiliar with, yet did not even charge me for her time. I did have her do the keyword research portion for my site, and was pleased with her timeliness and explanation of the results. I would recommend Angela to others looking for an honest, helpful, and expert opinion on their website.]
