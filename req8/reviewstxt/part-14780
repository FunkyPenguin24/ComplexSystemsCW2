[108426358573294419948,100954947764400655727,I am thrilled with the experience I have had with Marquis Plastic Surgery. Having my 3 year old son undergo emergency reconstructive surgery on his mouth after an accident was scary and gut wrenching. Dr. Desroisers was able to explain the procedure and assure me that he was in safe hands. As my son was taken into the operating room I had all these fears that his face would never look the same. Fortunatly, the surgery came out very successful! I always like to show the before and after picture so you can see what great stitching and precision Dr. Desrosiers has. He was always just a phone call away if I had any questions. He and his staff are very professional and a pleasure to work with.]
