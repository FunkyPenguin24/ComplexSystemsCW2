[102182894672464674608,100113182850864128528,Ordered our meal At 5pm for 8pm and was late after 2nd phone call it arrived 30mins late. Meal was cooked within an inch of its life over done and chips were far from fresh I have used this chip shop before it was ok what has happened is there a new fish fryer ? my meal was sadly uneatable rotten chips and cremated fish a bugger supper that was stootin.. Guess it could have been an off night but really we do deserve better. No more disasters like I just had waste of money only fit for bin]
