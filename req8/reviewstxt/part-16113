Its my preference to shop here but that's exactly what it is: personal preference. Yes, they are a chain and do try to up sell but if you state that you have a specific budget and don't want to go over it, how can anyone make you? Also, lifetime free adjustments on all cable parts and a $60 2 year maintenance plan is a ridiculous deal for the money you spend on bikes from this store. I'm a customer here originally because I bought a bike off craigslist that was purchased here and they continued to honor the lifetime adjustments without care for whether I was the original owner. No receipt checking or whatever. I owned that bike for 2 years and for 2 years they took care of it. Honestly, that's pretty rare. That's what made me stay as a customer.]
