[115755672012769440163,100477226053303504370,El Porton is a festive restaurant. The service was excellent. The menu offers many entrees, beverage and desserts. The food is very tasty and good, the chips are exceptional, homemade. The draw back with the salsa is for me, the one served is hot and i need a mild to mix them. The appearance of the exterior is deceiving. I recommend this for good mexican style and food!]
