[111493945646089674772,101002263722712936838,I went to Armando's for the 1st time after hearing very good reviews from co-workers, when I walked in there no staff in sight, I wasn't sure if I should seat myself or wait to be seated. I walked in and leaned over to see a cashier on the phone - she explained I could seat myself. The natural fruit juices were delicious, my Cuban sandwich was good, but the traditional arroz con pollo dish that my fiance had almost had a after tast of mole which is actually a Mexican dish and has nothing to do with arroz con pollo. Pretty odd! We were waited on by 2 different people and as we're waiting for our waiter to come by to get our check the bus boy is already picking up dishes from our table. We will not be returning to Armando's, the food was just okay to me, and service was definitely a deal breaker.]
