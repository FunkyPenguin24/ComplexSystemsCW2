[111026015266674801740,100654793954230859493,I've had storage units with other companies, but this is the best one! The place is very neat and clean. Glenda is one of the best managers I've ever seen...She was very helpful when I came to check out the units, explained everything in detail, and made sure that I understood everything, asked if I had questions, and also mentioned that they had boxes, tape, locks and whatever I needed to pack my items. I left the property knowing that my items would be safe.]
