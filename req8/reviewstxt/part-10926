[112950906413344467180,100743383974759495440,I absolutely love the care my puppy gets when we go here! The staff is super friendly, and they always work with you to get you discounts on medicine and treatments. The doctors saved our parvo-puppy when we first got him, and they've been continually great, ever since. BTW... as an Alabama fan.. the ONLY time I like to see that many Auburn diplomas in an office is at a Vet. That's a great Vet school, and they have great docs working at Countryside. I recommend them to ANYONE living in our area.]
