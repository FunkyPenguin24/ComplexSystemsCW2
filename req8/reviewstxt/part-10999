[111609585825283332677,100747886854807221153,I was determined to purchase a brand new car as I arrived at Pacific Honda. My original intention was to pick up the Civic Si Sedan and the gentlemen I spoke too (Zaid Darzi) helped me gladly. He did attempt as much as he could to get me the Si as they did not have any in stock. He went through several phone calls and several managers but there were no Si sedans available. After carefully deciding, I chose to go with the 2012 Civic Ex Sedan. It was an excellent choice and great on gas mileage. Zaid was an enormous amount of help throughout the three hours I had spent there. If you plan on purchasing a new car from there, definitely ask for him! He made things easy as was very fast with what I had asked for. Thanks again. Overall, I had a fun great time and was happy with my purchase. When the 2013 Civic Si Sedans come out, I'll definitely come back to take a look.]
