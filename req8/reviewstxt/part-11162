[103705608136749568206,100756416398042942164,Had a little confusion because I assumed that the numbered meals were "lunch specials", but after I was served what I didn't intend to order, they made it right. Buffet small, but each item on it was awesome. Far better than most buffets 8 x as large. Decor is diner-like prosaic but clean. If I lived or worked closer, I'd certainly be a regular customer.]
