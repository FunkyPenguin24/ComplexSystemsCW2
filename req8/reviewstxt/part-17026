[102512200691161556984,101076966824522979333,I walked into Thai Healing house having never had a Thai massage, only your typical resort swedish massages while on vacation. I left there a customer for life and frankly don't know why anyone would ever choose swedish over Thai, if given the choice. The Thai Healing House was referred to me by a good friend and I only wish I would have gone in sooner because it was truly therapeutic. The place is super clean, the staff is friendly and professional, and the results are amazing. I work out 4-5 days per week and I tried Thai Healing House before a weekend race and never felt better, ie., more limber, stronger, and I just felt loose and relaxed versus tight and knotted. I am so glad to have the Thai Healing house in my area and I strongly encourage everyone to give them a go. Jonathan]
