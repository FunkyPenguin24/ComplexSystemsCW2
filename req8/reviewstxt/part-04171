[109742190560450848547,100379951442435008490,I have an ongoing dispute going with Claret Fitness. I used the facilities from June 2013-Nov1st 2013 and the management kept charging my credit card through Feb 2014 even though I am back in the States and no longer in Barcelona. They were not authorized to do this along with the fact that I paid each month in cash for the services not realizing that my card was being charged in addition. This is Fraudulent! I am disputing all charges through my credit card company. Connor Gregory]
