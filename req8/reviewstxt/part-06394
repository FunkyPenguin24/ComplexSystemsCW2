[115608325141975511253,100498205118329703456,I have a few tattoos. The largest and most precious to me is the one created by Miguel Prada. His work is AMAZING. He is extremely professional, artistic and has fantastic 'chair side manners'. The work he did is on my back: its all words, BACKWARDS (mirror image), the of a portion of a poem. The font, placement and artistry he did makes it look beautiful, elegant and sexy. It could have looked 'ghetto' and tacky, easily. My boyfriend, when I told him what I was going to get, was terrified at the final result. He pleaded I change my mind! When he saw the result he was very impressed. I get compliments on it ALL the time...Oh, my BF eventually ended up getting his very first tattoo fr Miguel. He loves as I do. The shop itself is clean and has really wonderful energy. The staff is really great too. It has such a great vibe that you'd want to just hang out there and chill out with the guys! I highly recommend this place to everyone.]
