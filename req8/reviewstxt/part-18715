[109465557364361230363,101167754390207325970,Small place tucked in a corner of an office park, catering to the lunch hour local crowd. Food is served cafeteria-style, with a menu that rotates daily. I have never had a dish here that wasn't excellent. The restaurant does a brisk trade, and the food is consistently freshly-made. Occasionally, they will run out of an item, and deliver it to you in the dining room within about five minutes. Dishes include classic Vietnamese hot and spicy chicken, ginger chicken, beef and potatoes, spicy sweet and sour. Good Vietnamese crispy eggrolls, too. Portion size is generous, service is friendly and consistent.]
