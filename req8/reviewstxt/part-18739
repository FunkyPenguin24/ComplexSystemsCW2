[106183043714613999111,101169649547988763158,Not too long ago I took my Firebird to this shop (after Several others) Not only does my car run better than it Ever has,it drives better & sounds Very Sweet! Plus I was given information about my car I'd requested that I've been unable to get from anyone else in the past! Then came the bill,[],[],I was So stuned at how LOW It was! Unlike previous shops that gave me a quick fix,charged me an arm & a leg,then sent me on my way-My car had a few things done(corectly) & I really thought it was going to be pretty high...I will Never'go anywhere else again for auto repairs (Or TIRES) Thankyou Will(ect)you guys are Awesome 8/1/2012 Last week after my truck was damaged I requested that it be towed here..Even though it was dropped in at the spur of the moment,the owner of the shop made sure that my little boy & I had our truck back the very same day! Fantastic...Thankyou Will']
