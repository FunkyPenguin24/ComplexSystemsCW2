[100100769235032673424,100141620129414604416,I order a shrimp plate with vegetable melody. I should have asked or been told what is in the Melody, part was Eggplant . I am allergic to Eggplant and did start to have an reaction, I took a pile to stop the reaction. I never eat the eggplant but just in contact with the other foods I started to get sick. It should be on the menu what is on each plate. The fire alarm went off and we were told not to leave it Happened before and FD turn off.]
