[105712882574619535029,100716082389089213427,This is my second Volkswagen CC purchased from John Ostlund and Dean Team Volkswagen. John is very courteous and extremely knowledgeable about the product line. It is truly a hassle-free experience which is one of the main reasons I keep coming back. My wife just purchased a new vehicle a few weeks before from another dealership and we had to deal with the "typical car salesman": pushy, aggressive and he even threatened us if we didn't give him a perfect score on his review. Needless to say we did not give him a perfect score. My experience with John and the Dean Team was the exact opposite. I was made to feel comfortable from the very start and was at no time pressured into something I didn't want. The whole process took less than a few hours (it only took that long because I couldn't make up my mind) and I am extremely satisfied with the service I received. I would highly recommend John Ostlund and Dean Team Volkswagen to anyone who is fed up with the "typical car salesman."]
