[102383517932186096810,101074500697037473536,I would have rated this mechanic 4 or 5 stars after my first service with them. They were affordable, friendly, and honest. I took my car in for a bearing and hub assembly replacement (for which they gave me the best quote out of 5 mechanics in the area). They also gave me what I know to be an honest estimate of front/rear brake pad wear so I even had them replace my front pads. When I left I everything was running great, except that my steering wheel alignment was off (steering wheel at 1 o'clock when driving straight). I thought it would be no big deal, since they told me that all their service was backed by a 1 year/12,000 mile warranty. Well, it turns out you only get the warranty service if you can prove that they caused the problem (which is very difficult!). They were very rude, unlike when I first brought in my car, and basically called me a liar, suggesting that I probably "ran over a rock". Disappointing... I thought I had finally found a good mechanic for regular service.]
