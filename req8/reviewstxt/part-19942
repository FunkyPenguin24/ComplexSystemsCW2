[104780570861742216747,100056731160148899871,I bought $7000 worth of furnishings and there was nothing that went right with the order. Quantities were not right. Shipping items as they arrived in their warehouse was not followed up on. I had to call periodically to see if items were ready to ship. I am still waiting on 2 bar stools which were bought almost 6 months ago. 3 were bought, one was ordered from the manufacturer. There were items such as ordering 2 pairs of pillows but getting one pair. The quantities for the pillows were correct on my order form but was not ordered that way from the manufacturer. If you purchase anything there I would suggest that you take delivery immediately. THERE ARE NO CHECKS AND BALANCES BETWEEN THE PURCHASE INVOICE AND THE ITEMS THEY THINK THEY OWE YOU. Do not put yourself in a position of waiting for them to order it and deliver it.]
