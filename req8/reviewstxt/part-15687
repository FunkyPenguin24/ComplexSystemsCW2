[107118309895252065088,101003914342318683176,I have buying from this store since around 1967 at three different locations. The new store is as nice as any of the large chain stores. The difference is the staff is very informed on the latest music equipment. I buy from them , because it is local, they have great staff, prices almost always will be competitive, and maybe the most important: is that when there is a problem, they will help you take care of it. That does not happen on line all the time. I would tell you to shop here for your music needs.]
