[105984143036369239914,101006291874676985257,I am a handyman and I am always trying to get in and get out of a store without too much time wasted. I do a lot of work in the Holly Springs and Fuquay area and cringe every time that I have to go into the local Home Depot to pick up supplies. The people are generally nice, but don't have near enough knowledge to answer simple questions and I have yet to find someone that can show me the location of an item without walking me all over the store. I really wish there was some place else that I could go instead of this HD.]
