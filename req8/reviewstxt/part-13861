[102575506885553118246,100903393398867345579,Halftime is under new management, apparently, and has an all-new lunch menu to go with the new management. I came in just after noon today for lunch, and was the fourth customer. The only waitress took my order (sliders and fries) and brought me my soda. My meal (3 small sliders and an order of fries) took about 35 minutes to reach my table. The waitress was friendly enough checking on me and refilling my drink, but never once mentioned the long wait, or offered to check on the food. The food itself was good. The sliders were well seasoned, and cooked perfectly. The menu claimed one slider would be dressed with the chef's homemade BBQ sauce, but I realize now that it wasn't. The fries were nicely done, crispy, but not burnt. The sliders and fries were served in a plastic basket with a paper liner - standard bar food plating. From what I could see, there isn't a seat in the restaurant without a direct line of sight to a tv, including a massive projection screen taking up most of one wall. A few "sporty" knick knacks line the walls, but not much else in terms of decor. Halftime has 4 beers on tap, two light beers, an ultra light, and Blue Moon. I noticed about a dozen bottled beers, the most "exotic" being Guinness and Dos Equis. They have a full bar, however, and appeared to have a few specialty drinks available. This seems like it would be a nice place to watch a game or two, drink light beer, and have some wings, or other sportsy food. As of right now, I can't recommend it for anything else. I want to come back and try Halftime for dinner, and to catch a game or two. I hope that service and meal times can improve by then.]
