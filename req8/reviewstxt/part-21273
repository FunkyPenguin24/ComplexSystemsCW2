[110772703553422607503,100127607418743972070,I just leased a 2013 S60 from AutoNation Volvo Irvine. Ghaleb Abdallah was my sales consultant and I'm very happy with the service I received. From the moment he approached me I could tell he was working for me. I told him what I was interested in and we were off on the test drive. Shortly after we went over package options and I told him what I was willing to pay. It was getting late in the day so he said I could go home and he would call me the next day. I got a phone call the next day from Roy who is one of the managers and after a couple obligatory negotiations back and forth we came to a price that worked for both sides. I went down to sign the paperwork and unfortunately they had to do a dealer trade for the car that I want from LA and with traffic being what it is there was a huge delay in the delivery of the car. Ghaleb apologized and offered to deliver the car himself with the paperwork to my home in San Clemente later that night. That is what I call customer service and as someone who leases a new car every year and half (and I have two) Ghaleb and his team are a group that I would definitely bring my business back to.]
