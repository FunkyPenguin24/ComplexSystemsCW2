[100009717826684635452,101025957906588646435,First off, I'd like to thank Darin Labette for his keen eye of quality and attention to details. Here's my story... In around October of 2012 I purchased (2) 15" rim sized Falken Rocky All Terrain tires from a Discount Tire in Nashville TN. I couldn't afford 4 so I purchased 2. Then they put the new ones on the rear and the best of my old bald tires up front. Great service as usual. Fast forward to Nov 2013.... I called around for the best prices to get my final 2 tires. I used my original receipt from D.T. with the exact model numbers and asked around. Not only did this location have THEE best deal in town, Darin beat my originally costs from the Nashville D.T. I went to! NOW this story gets better.... Upon my arrival, Darin noticed that someone accidently put the Falken Ziex model tires on my truck, not the Falken Rocky's I originally purchased. He said this was a rare odd situation but an honest mistake. The Falken name and their model numbers on both tires are very similar! Since this was a D.T. mistake from another state, he corrected it by replacing them for the correct tires at no cost. I drove almost 40,000 miles on the wrong ones! I purchased the final 2 at the negotiated price and I now have a complete NEW set for these crazy michigan white slip & slide winter months. Thank you again Darin. After being unemployed for almost a year and just starting my third week at my new job up here in the "D" I TRULY needed this. Snows a coming and I've got a 45 minute commute each way to work. Again thank you, your 5 star mechanics and Discount Tire for living up to the name on the front of their stores. Sincerely M.Porter By the way, while calling around, Bell Tires best prices were $68 more and they refused match or go any lower .!]
