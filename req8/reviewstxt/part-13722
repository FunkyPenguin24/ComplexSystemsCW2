[103207040456893681279,100897364552053757532,I love Applebee's, and there was a time where I liked this particular Applebee's. Unfortunately that time has passed. It would appear that management has changed in the last year or so, as the service has fallen considerably. Where I was used to prompt and continuous service, I can now expect my waiter(waitress) to completely vanish once my food has been served. A fact that is magnified by cold food being served my last couple of visits. On my last visit, my waitress completely disappeared (I have no idea where to) and I had to wait 45 minutes for a check AFTER I had finished eating. Other customers might have left without paying, but I did my best to give the place a chance. I will not be returning any time soon.]
