[105252932225215374151,101005173047581544427,EVERYTHING Food In Bloom provided for our event--the food, the presentation and the staff were exemplary. Their professionalism and execution exceeded our expectations. We will certainly recommend Food In Bloom highly to anyone in need of their services. And, we will jump at the chance to hire them again for our next event. A special thank you to Krystal Kelch, Tom Sted and their excellent servers. The staff magically set everything up and then boxed the leftover (delicious) food, swept the floors and exited the building cleaner than it was when they got there! Simply wonderful! If a five star rating is the best, we give Food In Bloom 6 stars!]
