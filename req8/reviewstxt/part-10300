[114838082871112883739,100710529717331086497,I ordered dinner from Cristino's online. When I got there, they had not received my online order and in fact could not find it. I say they have excellent service because the owner went above and beyond to correct this problem. It ended up they had technical difficulties and my order actually came thru while I was there waiting. So, even as they were slammed (and for good reason, the food is amazing) he pushed my order through. When we got home, everyone - friends and family- were so impressed with the quality of the food, we never even gave the little extra wait another thought. Bravo! Cristino's!]
