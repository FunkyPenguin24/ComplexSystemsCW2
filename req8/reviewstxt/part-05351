[103341788272456543202,100443958280071247428,I have been to a lot of dental practices moving around Atlanta and this one is far the best. They are so personable, the office is very nice, they ALWAYS are on time and they explain to you everything that they are doing. They take detailed notes about everything you discuss with them in the office and remind you of it when you come in for your next visit. The front office coordinates with the back during your appointment so your next appointment is scheduled before you even get out of the chair. I have never had a bad experience there and they don't pressure you about services like a lot of other dentists do.]
