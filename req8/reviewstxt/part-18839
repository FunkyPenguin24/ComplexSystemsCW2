[105631332745259609277,101174528807961286361,This has to be the worst resort I have ever been to. The sheets are at least 10 years old and really rough on the skin and caused my gf to get rashes. The taxi driver they arranged to take us around the island threatened us. The food is barely edible, the prices are outrageous. I could go on and on about how bad this resort is, do not go. You will regret it]
