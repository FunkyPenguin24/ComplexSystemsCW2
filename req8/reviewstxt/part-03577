[103757515131266084757,100345269403200966229,With Disney I have come to expect excellence.Maybe this is because I have stayed at Animal Kingdom and Wilderness Lodge Resorts in the past. The Coronado was not living up to the same standards. True the resort is spread out and requires a lot of walking, but this maybe should be obvious based on the layout mapped out when booking. There are 4 bus stop locations. If you stay near the 4th stop it is sometimes difficult to get a bus. If full, they skip the 4th stop. The bathroom area in the room was disappointing. The shower had mildew which caused an odor. After complaining about the smell and mildew, I was told they would clean it, but nothing was done. Later I complained it was not clean. They appeared to try to do something, but maybe not enough. They did give our kids to plush Minnie Mouse dolls. But nothing which would make me run back or walk back this this resort. Ordered pizza in the room after a long day at the park as kids were tired. When ordering they said it would take an hour. An hour and a half later still no pizza. Not much longer after that the pizza finally did come, but it was sub-par at best.]
