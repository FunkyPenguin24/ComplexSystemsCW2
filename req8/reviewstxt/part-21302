[101765876945723866728,100129412754140322996,I've stayed here many times. It's a basic Motel 6 setup with affordable clean rooms and friendly staff. I usually reserve a room online with a promo code to get a 10% discount before I arrive. This location is two doors down from Hopworks Urban Brewery for good inexpensive food and there's much local nightlife/entertainment of the kind Portland is known for up and down SE Powell! In the AM there is free coffee in the office, but I recommend driving the mile up the way to Stumptown's on SE Division.]
