[103478860184443885330,100423501773667332159,Went there looking for help. I am a newbie to salt water aquariums. Needed advice on just about everything. The staff was very helpful. They answered my questions and asked some of their own to get a better idea what I had in mind. Never felt any pressure to buy anything. I did end up purchasing a filter system and heater. I can't wait to go back to get the stuff for phase two.]
