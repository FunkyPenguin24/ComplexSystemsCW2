[101506822333992113553,100767678125207477803,When I walked in and saw the trompo (vertical spit for the al pastor), I knew I was going to enjoy the experience. The al pastor here is fantastic--best I've had since living in Mexico years ago, in fact. The lengua is delicious as well. There's a great little salsa bar. It isn't the most varied selection, but what's there is solid. And the horchata definitely hits the spot. Service is friendly. I love this place!]
