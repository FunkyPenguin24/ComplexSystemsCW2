[116072927479957259781,100407705879368521694,Prior to walking through the front doors at Bob Rohrman Schaumburg Ford, I dreaded the entire car buying process. I even brought my very informed neighbor and friend for "back up". All those negative thoughts about purchasing a car disappeared instantly when I was introduced to my salesman, Paul Van Duser. He was the most kind, knowledgeable and "non-pressure" salesperson I have ever dealt with, which totally earned not only my respect and trust, but the respect and trust of my friend and my husband. I will highly recommend Paul Van Duser and Schaumburg Ford to my family, friends and acquaintances. Thank you, Paul and Schaumburg Ford! Sincerely, Teresa Colby-Dokubo Schaumburg, IL]
