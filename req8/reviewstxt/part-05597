[100649813418583088514,100455875921199171629,Stay away from this company! They installed my system and after 1 year it needed maintenance. It needed maintenance the following 2 years as well and we were charged for every visit, finally they figured out that it was clogged with debris and they tried to charge us $1500 to fix it! After a year of pushing them to fix it they fixed it for free. Next year same thing!!!! system was totally clogged and they refused to even look at it without charging for maintenance. We had to pay over $500 for them to fix it again. These people have no understanding of decent customer service. We LOVE heating our pool with the sun, and when it works it is great, but they installed our system inappropriately and blamed us for it at every step. Find another company these people are rude, unfriendly and will take every opportunity to fleece you.]
