[115837633944221451142,100094285548042722291,I have been going to Kelley for approximately 12 years. She is amazing and does an awesome job with nails, hair, eyebrows anything you need. She is very personable and her new salon is very professional but relaxed and a great place to spend an hour or so getting pampered. I have referred quite a few people to her over the years and they all have been quite pleased. I highly recommend her or any of her colleagues. Keep up the great work!!!! Also, I see nothing wrong with taking coffee somewhere they are providing you with a service. It's like an extra tip for a job well done.]
