[111003890509137047749,100926153719000199335,Excellent service provide by Dale and his company yesterday. Efficient, professional, well-presented, courteous, friendly and nothing was too much trouble. What sets one company apart from another is often in the small things, the details. Dale telephoned me to say he was leaving the collection address and again to say he was 5 minutes away from the delivery address. This kind of attention to detail leaves you with a good feeling about the experience, it makes it memorable and so you are inclined to use the company again and recommend it to friends. It seems so obvious and yet too many companies ignore the logic of this inescapable truth... to their cost. Dale made what could have been a difficult or tedious day for me, go without a hitch and I am grateful to him and his colleague. Thanks guys!]
