[108906575473549005581,100008601066891889228,This place is awful - they will rip you off in a heartbeat. Took a flat tire in to get fixed and was told that it's "company policy" to replace it. Didn't even take a look to evaluate if it could be fixed, just wanted to sell me a new tire, the cheapest being $150. Took it to another place to have it looked at and turns out IT DIDN'T EVEN NEED TO BE FIXED. The cold had caused it to go flat - just needed some air and I was good to go.]
