[104353032029621247353,100117852846301039420,My experience at Curry Honda was perfect. The sales associates were wonderful. They all greeted me as soon as I walked in the door, but it wasn't overbearing. They were extremely nice and helpful. The car dealer and general sales manager that I went through to trade in my car for a new Honda made the experience extremely painless. They explained everything to me as it happened and were very patient with me. I recommend this dealership to anyone buying or trading in a car!]
