[108219578437223821079,101119165032278845107,Dr. St. Matthew-Daniel and her staff are fantastic. It had been several years since I had been to the dentist. It's certainly not on my top favorite things to do. From the moment I arrived, I was provided comfort and pampered through the entire process. Everyone made sure my experience was as anxiety and pain free as possible. Not to mention the great job that was done on my teeth. All I can say is, I found my new dentist for life. Experienced Dentist that really cares.]
