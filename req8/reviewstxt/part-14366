[106172296219258025308,100933065831997343908,We wanted to do a small vanity remodel to spruce up a secondary Bath. Modern Mosaics came to the property looked at everything and then proposed a very classy looking project that allowed us to reuse the existing cabinet. The mosaic tile back splash and expensive looking (but not really expensive) faucet made the project pop. Everything cam in on budget and looked great. Kudos to modern Mosaics for that level of customer service. Great selection of unique items in this shop. Well worth a visit.]
