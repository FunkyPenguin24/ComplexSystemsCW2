[110416381916730101698,100298110077088425696,Misleading Floor Plans - note there is NO outside storage, even though their layouts and brochures tell you there is. Poor Move in Process - the apartment was very dirty on move in Parking - lucky to find a spot. You can rent a covered space or a garage, but this is only helpful if there is one near your apartment, and they are also pricey. Landscape is Bug Friendly - the bushes make beautiful landscaping, but attract lots of bugs! I have been fighting a bug problem for 3 months! Pool - nice pool, however the lights around the pool are too bright at night, if your apartment is pool facing, expect to never have a dark bedroom at night. The light floods into your room!! Appliances - Everything works great but the over and water heater. Gym - mimimal, and the temperature is set to 82 degrees, which for any gym goer is too high! Community Events - None Property - the gate codes only work 60% of the time. Mailboxes - there is no outgoing mail slot. Area - the area is nice, lots of things close by.]
