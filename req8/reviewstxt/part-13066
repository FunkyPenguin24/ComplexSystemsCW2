[100384475569012571818,100860653979764472301,I went here tonight with my family for dinner, the service was very prompt, and the atmosphere was inviting. They also offer a selection of fresh squeezed juices along with a regular beverage selection. The food arrived relatively quickly, The appetizers and soup came within 5 minutes, I tried the lamb chili, which was very good. For the main course, I had the sampler platter, which was very well presented and flavorful, my only gripe would be, that they seemed to be out of many items that were on the menu, there was no meat pie with my sampler platter, which was disappointing, but the rest of the meal made up for it, It was delicious. Also, they were out of half of the desserts on the menu, which was also pretty disappointing. However, it was an overall good experience, as the service was prompt and courteous, which more than made up for the items they ran out of. I will most likely be attending again!]
