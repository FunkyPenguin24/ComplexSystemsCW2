[100130393560639116976,100990240701449127937,I have had nothing but pleasant experiences in the several times I have been to Big Al's. Mike and Dave are great, easy to talk to, and they explain everything wonderfully. I frequent the store a lot, with 6 work vehicles and 2 personal, and each and every time they get us taken care of quick and professionally. If you need tires, they'll get you tires. If you need alignment, they'll get you alignment (even before they offered it at this location they managed to get it done!). Its a one stop shop, good people and good work!]
