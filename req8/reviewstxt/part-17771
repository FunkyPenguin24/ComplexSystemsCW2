[100924371959823265791,101118634628179537512,I have so much to say about this comapany, but my time is short because I am so busy these days with work... ALL thanks for Pathfinders, Inc. Pathfinders has the most professional, friendly, and helpful staff. You take an exam on your first visit to the office. They have a helpful and efficient system for matching you with employers and companies in the Atlanta area. I had a few prospects, and actually interviewed with 2 companies in less than 2 months. I received copious amounts of help with my resume, employer background information, interview suggestions, and general feedback. I WOULD NOT have had such a successful job search without Pathfindres, Inc. I absolutely recommend this comapny to anybody who is looking for a hardworking staff that will assist them in finding an established company for immediate employment.]
