[113696908221929487798,100687964504432136566,Our visit to Sandpiper Beacon Beach resort was interesting. We first ariaved at 12pm for check in, we were told that our room was ready, then as they checked, it was not ready. They said that the cleaning crew goes to lunch at 12:30 for 1 hour and that we would be able to get into our room no later than 2 pm. So we decided to go have lunch since they told us that we could not use the resort until we checked into our room, even though we had already put a $200 deposit down plus the $227 per night we had already paid for the room. Then they tell us that the room does not include our 2 children and we have to pay extra for them, there is additional $45 for them. We also make sure there is a iron in the room, they tell us it is a $20 cash deposit for the iron. We also ask about the deposit, they said that at check out our $200 deposit will be returned, it is now Thursday and no return of the deposit. 3 pm rolls around and they call and said that the room was ready. We go to our room, once we get in, the shower curtain was on the floor of the bathtub. We had 6 people in our room and when we checked in we told them that we needed more towels. Around 7-8 pm they decided to bring more towels. When we went to go and use the utensils, they were all filthy dirty and the plates were also. So, once again we had to wait for them to bring clean utensils, that was about 1 hour later and they didn't give us all new ones, they just swapped stuff out. The stove was from 1980 with used tin foil all in it. The room is half the size of a room at a $40 motel. I was very disappointed in this hotel, they did not have much to offer the kids on the holiday weekend. The lounge chairs the have you have to pay to sit in them (ridiculous). Also there is no continental breakfast. I must say, for as much as people pay to stay there, they need to offer a little bit more. I know that I could have stayed at the Holiday Inn Resort and paid about $50 less per night. I do not recommend you stay here at all. HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!!!]
