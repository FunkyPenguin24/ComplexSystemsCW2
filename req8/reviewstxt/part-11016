[104804508690281593125,100748704430551081266,I've been in need of some dental work for a while but like a lot of people put it off to the point I was very embarrassed about the condition of my teeth. I found NW Smile design on the internet and decided to give them a shot. I was pleasantly surprised. I never felt judged at all, they just said "we can fix that". I really feel like they have my best interest in mind. I've even gotten a few follow up phone calls from Dr.Petersen himself on his lunch break or after hours to check up on me. How often does that happen anymore? Good people, positive attitudes and great service. I no longer dread going to the dentist. Totally satisfied customer, and yes this is a real review, I never knew them before a few months ago. Thank you guys. :)]
