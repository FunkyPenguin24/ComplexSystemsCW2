[105809911685647963330,100232521805639589979,I outsourced Michael recently and he did a great job. Once I gave him a quick intro to the network, he worked on the workstations, server and network equipment with no problem. He performed the job without having to bother me with questions which was great. I will definitely be sending more business his way!]
