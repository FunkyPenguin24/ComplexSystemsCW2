[112861833625668525526,100707556914083572623,Amazing service so far!!!! We have struggled with internet service ever since we moved out to Eagle Mountain 4 years ago. We tried Digis and hated the internet speeds we got... it was NEVER what was advertised. We then switched to RapidWave and they were ok, but then they merged back with Digis! We had NOTHING BUT PROBLEMS and were regularly getting speeds less than 1 Mbps even though we had been paying for 15 Mbps. With Direct Communications we are getting exactly what we paid for (20 Mbps) and sometimes we even exceed that amount! I am absolutely amazed and wish I had made the switch years ago!]
