[102076316599107848773,100569133862820901972,This place is located in downtown Apache Junction. It is a golf themed restaurant, near a golf course. It is in an old building but the breakfast food is good at a good price and great service. It is American style food. It is a fun alternative to Denny's for breakfast. I felt like I was eating at a vintage restaurant in Globe, AZ.]
