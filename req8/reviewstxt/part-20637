[108570636413211023804,100093077744856516059,I had the pleasure of tasting a friend's birthday cake made by Karen, and it was the best ever. It was light and fluffy, not too sweet, and was an incredible work of art. It seemed a shame to have to cut it. A feast for the eyes as well as the palate. Now I know where to go when I need a cake.]
