[115765921074935617434,100651714791742067592,Jacob, Is very knowledgeable about handguns. I learned a lot from taking his course Oct 20,2012. I never shot a handgun in my life and looking forward to shooting a 38 revolver a Smith & Wesson. Jacob and several students gave my husband and I places where we can try different guns out before we purchase one. We are new to the state of Colorado and all this information is so wonderful. I would like to Thank everyone in the class for the helpful information and all the laughs!!! Had a great day Gob bless all. Namaste, Zeula ( Aka Debbie Lee Dickinson )]
