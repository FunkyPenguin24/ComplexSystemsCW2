[100368490953068541147,100248944169351758208,I had been there once and am going again! Found the sushi I had ordered last time to be absolutely wonderful, the soup great and the service friendly and professional. for a meat restaurant, the prices were good. It is a semi fancy atmosphere and one that you could bring a date to or your family. either way a great choice!]
