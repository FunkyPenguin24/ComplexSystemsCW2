[100373374777411931375,100295781569644949849,The first thing I noticed when I first came here was the Stumptown coffee. The only other places I have been able to get this coffee is Seattle, Portland and NYC. I have been craving this coffee for sometime so when I heard this place serves the coffee here, I knew I had to pay a visit. The layout of this cafe is pretty versatile; you have tables out front, stools at the bar, individual stools/tables on the side and seating upstairs. It's a pretty vibrant place unlike other coffee shops where patrons look like zombies and the ambiance is a bit depressing. The popularity of this place is evident in the rating on Yelp and also the difficulty in finding a seat here. It's a great place to grab lunch, meet a friend over coffee or get some work done (free wi-fi).]
