[111684664533813706426,100513724926889213761,Both vets are highly knowledgeable and don't mind explaining the details to those who are interested. They always manage to squeeze me in when there's an unforeseen issue that needs addressing. They have vaccine clinic days so that people who struggle financially can still afford basic care. They have a relationship with at least two Orange County rescue groups, which makes me very happy. I need to know that the vet I give my business to really cares. Dr. Wiatt and Dr. Rossi have proven to me that they do. Another reviewer mentioned the' revolving staff', but I've always been impressed by how quickly the new staff members learn the ropes. I won't name names, but one of their more recent additions is now one of my favorites. I had been to six other vets in the immediate area before determining that Pet Hospital was the right choice for me. If you're looking for a new vet, give them a try. You won't be disappointed.]
