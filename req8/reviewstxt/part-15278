The photos are deceiving and leads the viewer to believe they would be staying in a much nicer place. The toilet didn't flush, shower didn't have any water pressure and the floors were filthy. It is a "economy" motel and basically served as a place to sleep. If you don't expect much this is your place. If you expect a little more, avoid.]
