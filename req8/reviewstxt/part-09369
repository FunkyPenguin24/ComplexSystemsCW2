[114743724172746053629,100658960598716849529,I had been to another dealership an hour before I walked into Chevrolet of Naperville and they told me I'd never be able to get what I wanted for the price I wanted to pay and kind of chuckled at me. Then they quoted me a price almost double what I was willing to pay and what was listed on their website. Their solution was to just finance more. The staff at Chevrolet of Naperville worked with me and found us the perfect car within our price range. Thank you! This is our second vehicle from a Dan Wolf owned dealership - and we'll definitely be back again.]
