Today I, literally, walked out of the store and drove another 30 minutes for what I wanted. The lady who works there should never, ever be working with the public, she should be in her PJs working from home, probably writing movie reviews. Also, if you still want to go there, make sure you get dressed up, walk in there with board shorts and flip flops doesn't even look at you. But the Cuban Restaurant next door is awesome!]
