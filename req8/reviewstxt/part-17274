Get rid of the swimming pool, open a Gym, make members pay as an example. there is nothing left here except water and seating... then if you are lucky a coffee... But I think this will be next to go if they open the new Alfresco area and coffee shop. I will be cutting up my membership at the end of this month and will never return... There are more and cheaper facilities and clubs at my local pub. Might turn my snooker que into a fishing rod and join the raby tavern fishing club.]
