[104195607576114776583,100279366357432030643,Was surprised at how cheap it was. 2 chicken pho and 2 thai tea boba drinks came out to 9.50. There is a 10 dollar min for credit cards so we ordered 2 more drinks and the total came to 11.30. The food and drink was good. The pho was pretty plain, but they provide sauces at the table so you can flavor to your needs]
