[111198491984234412343,100082684840197966876,I stopped in after a "hard" day in the heat. The iced late' was to die for. The waitress, Katelyn was pleasant, attentive, and efficient. Made an out of town visitor feel welcome and important. On a subsequent visit, while Katelyn wasn't there, those who were followed suit. It is the must visit coffee house in New Braunfels. They have made a regular out of me. See you there!]
