[114854280147498662752,100489852317854194569,I don't' know why is there so many crybabies reviewing . Over the years they serviced clutch, brakes, belts and did a collision repair on my Audi... Ford dealership wanted 3950$ for collision but Alex and Sergey did it for 1800$. They are good and they get the job done at a reasonable price. Not too cheap not too expensive. I take my wife's car to these guys and I recommend it to my friends. regards nick]
