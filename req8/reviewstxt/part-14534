[105944615760122657108,100942387442766990913,I am an avid bicyclist and originally went to see Dr. Tamar Gamliel in 2012 because I was experiencing numbness and tingling in my left leg. She introduced me to A.R.T. and I noticed a difference right away. Over a short time I have seen a huge improvement. I have continued to see her for adjustments/ As an athlete herself, she understands the issues and challenges I face and I have found her exercises and advice on posture and stretching to be invaluable. Her core classes are excellent to. One treatment and you'll recommend her as highly as I do!]
