[117404781054010460032,100133220639903376590,We had the best car shopping experience ever and when I tell my friends, they are so envious. First, they were very patient with me. I was really indecisive between getting the CRV or Pilot. They let me take my time, test drive the cars again and again, and run through many payment options. I decided on the Pilot. Jeremey was the one we worked with and he was so helpful with giving a summary of the important things to know in the manual and sitting in the vehicle and showing my me and my son how to operate all of the important and good-to-know features before we left the lot. I did use my Costco membership and had no hassles at all. The quotes they gave me on the phone were the same as when I came in. It saved me a lot of time (long drive there) and effort by getting the pricing upfront. 100% satisfied here. The Pilot is wonderful! Thanks, Jeremey & crew]
