[109544292648353472363,100084969805020415326,First time visitor went in for a recall part on my Liberty with 200k miles and they found a lot of work needed done. Ended up getting a new Compass for less money than fixing my Liberty as far as first year payments. Very nice staff and very clean facility. Thanks Chapman!]
