[116049570740135909821,101104422712668110731,I just love this place....my dentist next door suggest I go to New Image. I am 30 years old with braces but no one can tell since they are clear. Not only am I greatful for the smile they have given me but for the friends I've also made with the staff and the ladies up front. Everyone is sooo freindly and so sweet! Its been 2 years so far and I am so happy with the results. They are great with payment plans and helping you out with the BEST RESULTS in any way....they will work with you!! Thanks for everything New Image!! You are the best.]
