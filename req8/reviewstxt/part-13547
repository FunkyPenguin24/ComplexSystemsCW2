Every now and then the food will be a little sub-par or not like it normally is. I used to get the #4, but it had become too dry or overcooked so I avoided it. But I keep to my regulars and it's usually fine. So you might have bad luck and have the less-than-great food they serve about 7% of the time. But the other 93% is worth the 7%. Margarita's are strong but still taste good - expensive but worth the money. A few times we have gotten unflavored when we requested flavored, or on the rocks when we ask for frozen - but hey, they're margaritas so we just drink them anyway. Although once we requested peach and it tatsed like lime. They skimped us quite a bit. A few of the waiters could afford to learn a little more English in regards to their menu because we think sometimes errors have been made because they're too busy and don't take the half-second to really listen to what we're ordering. But the payoff is typically extremely fast service and food. IN SHORT, eat there. The longest we've had to wait when they are packed (Friday's from about 7-830pm) is still only about 15 minutes or so.]
