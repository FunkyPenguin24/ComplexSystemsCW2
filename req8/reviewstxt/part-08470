[105377337996358211447,100612250845077792473,Hello. Daniel Bridgman represented me in my social security case. As is the case, I was turned down by the government at the first stage. I had prepared extensively for this journey, but knew at this point I needed an experienced attorney to handle this. I searched long and hard, having already been forewarned about becoming a number with most of the advertised television attorney's. I didn't want to be a number...and I wasn't. Mr. Bridgman met with me at the first appointment and was with me throughout the case and into the administrative hearing. He was always available to answer any and every question I had and even called me out of the blue just to update me on my status. I highly recommend Mr. Bridgman and his firm and am certain that he will do his best to win your case. He won mine!!]
