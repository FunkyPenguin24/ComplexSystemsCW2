[108435217681401973530,100226773292312872209,Cheap food that tastes good, nice atmosphere, good drinks... I don't know what there is to not love about this place. Well, maybe the wait on weekends... I avoid anyplace on the weekends though. If it's not busy on Friday or Saturday on the Peninsula it's not any good. $3.50 texas tea is delicious. The buffalo chicken wrapper is great and huge. I eat half and save the other half for the next day lunch. Little disappointed they boosted their prices a tad, but I still love it.]
