[104335345885203108606,100614364528349736622,After a long and exhaustive search for a new vehicle I finally purchased a brand new Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. It’s a cute little SUV but is filled with safety features and tons of basic features that were part of the base model. It’s loaded with everything from Bluetooth to an inside temperature display and all for less than $17K. The best part is that I got a bumper to bumper 100,000 mile warranty and a 5 year Roadside Assistance Service!! When they told me that, I was sold. Plus, they helped me with the financing challenge of being upside down in what I owed on my old vehicle. So, a big Thank You to RC Hill Mitsubishi, especially Jeff and Bob for being so helpful!!]
