[110989843677392205776,100363459656384340540,First time here, on a Saturday afternoon. Great service, they operated as a team to make us feel welcome. Answered our questions about the ingredients. Invited us to the Sushi Bar to watch Liki himself make our rolls which was a fun experience and he described what he was doing which was interesting. Decor was very appealing. Food was ample portions and very delicious, and the prices were very reasonable. We will definitely come here again! Thank you Liki and family! -Justin]
