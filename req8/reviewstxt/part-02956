[112660380114414933201,100312039143476677422,From the time we moved in to the time we moved out the front office staff has never had the same answer twice for the exact same question. They overcharge for EVERYTHING, on our last day we went in to pay our final utility bill and it was $60, the front desk woman said no its only $30, so we paid the final bill, Just for them to take out $61.99 from deposit for our "final utility bill." The complex is nice don't get me wrong but if you are not an aviation student you don't matter to Weidner (the management company). They have horrible customer service if you call, you can bet they 1. won't pick up or 2. will be extremely rude with you, and don't bother leaving a voicemail they never call back. From the first month to the last month my roommate and I had nothing but issues at Aspire and we were there over a year and a half. From our first bill being incorrect to our last "bill." Needless to say I will never live at another Weidner owned property.]
