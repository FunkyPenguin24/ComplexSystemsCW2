[115421726878598338708,100070253593341290525,Went last week (June 30th ish) in the drive thru to wait and wait.... drove up to the window, nobody there. Then a female worker holding her kid in her arms go through the kitchen to get the headset to tell people they are closed.... needless to say i only assumed they were shorthanded for the night,. Now fast forward to July 7th, I give them another try... the automated system tells me that they are unable to take orders... overnight crew needs to be trustworthy or at least take down the 24 hour sign]
