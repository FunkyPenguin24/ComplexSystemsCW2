[100291049508290588466,100470173408768736228,The only real option for Italian food in the McCalla area. Overall the good is good but the service is severely lacking. The fresh baked table bread is excellent as is the marinara sauce. The meatballs are pretty bland - little more than balled up hamburger. Entrees are for the most part quite good and are a good value for the price.]
