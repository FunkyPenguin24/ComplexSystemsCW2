[100635211498495119235,100169866721299068348,If you're looking for a unique and quirky place to stay while visiting Portland, this is definitely the place to stay. The rooms were extremely clean and very well taken care of, the most comfortable beds we had experienced while in the area (we stayed in 3 hotels whilst on a week vacation), free movies while you stay, free PARKING for guests which is a very rare find, and the staff really couldn't have been any nicer! All in all, after paying to stay at a hotel almost double the rate on a previous day, The Kennedy School is one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in. It really was a great experience.]
