[114589067504277337474,100843878127611054923,We've been bringing our cats here for ten years. I recommend their services highly. All three vets are excellent and the office staff is friendly and accommodating. After reading some of the other reviews, I especially wanted to add something about my family's excellent experiences with Dr. Swann. Dr. Swann is the vet who usually sees our cats and he's always gentle, thorough, and very helpful with my questions. When our 19-year-old kitty had to be put to sleep after years of being treated for renal failure, Dr. Swann let us stay with him and hold him throughout the procedure and gave my husband and me time alone with him both before afterwards to say our goodbyes. He and his staff even helped us make arrangements for cremation. When we pulled ourselves together and went to check out, we were grateful and astonished to find out that there was no charge. A few days later Dr. Swann sent us a book about grieving for a pet, along with a lovely hand-written letter reassuring us that the extra care we'd given our cat had added two good years to his life. That's the kind of personalized service one rarely finds these days, and one of the reasons we love Dr. Swann and The Vet House.]
