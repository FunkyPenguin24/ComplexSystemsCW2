[102711572434553933589,100581822353920680484,Do not go here. They make money by lying to you. A car I bought about 4 months ago was brought here by a family member for repairs. Despite the warranty, my family member was charged $480 for repairs. Looking at the bill, maybe $100 of it was necessary. the only price that was given over the phone was $210, and upon arrival at the dealership at the end of the day, the price was $480. This is your typical scum bag car dealer. If they tell you your car needs 6 things done to it, you only need one.]
