[108295919546356384288,100815593458375342134,This place SUCKS they are very stupid and non compassionate. My daughter is on temporary financial assistance from the state (no reason to explain).Anyway had an appointment at Comfort dental and when we got there she told us the dentist called in sick and we would have to reschedule. When I asked why they did not call me she said they didn't have my number. I asked then how did you call me yesterday to confirm my appointment and she said she must have written it down wrong. The she said I can be seen at at different location which took me 20 min to get there. We got there and filled out new patient paper work and they call her back and she comes back out 5 min later and and said they will not see her I asked why the HELL not they said she either has to be pregnant or a child and when I said I would pay the $19.99 they said that is illegal. What the hell is this the F%&*** Obama crap or what just happen???? I still do not understand this.]
