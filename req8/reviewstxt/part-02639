[103273935640279461934,100295167503830077510,Last Saturday in Portland, it was over 100 degrees. Perfect day to be driven to four great breweries and learn a bit about Portland's great beer culture. Despite the fact that the OldPDX bus did not have air conditioning, the tour was well worth the money. If you like beer, hop on the bus!]
