[101469812538898899722,101014327492085512041,Eponymous cajun/creole menu that can be overwhelming at times. Imagine a NY diner sized menu with over 100 different creole dishes? It's impressive but you wonder how they can make everything on that menu with the same level of quality. Drinks are good as well as the scene. Great for lunch on a warm summer day with a friend!]
