[102838179672520271087,100308139635822567155,Good price vs other hotels/motels on the bay and was able to book a room for 1 night, last minute, without an upcharge unlike the bed and breakfasts. My wife also used an online coupon for an additional $10 off the quoted price. Staff was awesome, place was clean and updated.]
