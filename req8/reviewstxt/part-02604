[106527527006154430947,100293455108228567737,I have attempted to try Starbucks coffee many times before. Again this morning I went through the drive through and explained what type of coffee I was looking for. The young lady on the other end just stated "I like have no idea what you're asking for". I can not stand going to places that are stuck up and act as if they are better than you. I've been to this location a few different times and got the same reaction. As well as a few other locations. Hopefully one day I will be able to try their coffee.]
