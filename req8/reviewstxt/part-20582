[111960219407326913988,100090308389133979541,Oh my....Where do I begin! First off, I thank God for directing me to Dogdeland! Mr. Randall Stansell was by far, the best salesperson I've dealt with up to date! The professionalism, courtesy and friendliness were well beyond the standard! And as a U.S. military Soldier that I am, the respect was even greater; but I'm sure Mr. Stansell treats all his cutomers that way! It was too easy and quick dealing with Dodgeland. I went there, told him (Mr. Stansell) what I was looking for, and the first words from him was "Which color do you want?" Lol. And now I have "Polar Bear!" (2013 Bright-White Dodge Durango); that's what I named the vehicle. ;-). Thank you so much, Dodgeland and Mr. Stansell for your help on finding and getting a new vehicle to suit not only me, but my family as well. God Bless, less stress!]
