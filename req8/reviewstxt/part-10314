[106581561985309216591,100710963562441258146,Grady Nerad is, in my opinion, the best tattoo artist in the area hands down. Great dude, great work, clean, and has no problem chatting it up while he works on your tattoo. Also, very fair prices. I walked in with a friend of mine and just gave Grady a broad idea of what I was looking for, came back in a couple days and he had a rough sketch that looked exactly what I was picturing. Told me $250, and I paid $250 on the day, no bull****ting around! Definitely deserved the nice tip I gave him and would recommend him to anyone.]
