[105870949646105754424,100593201801569273162,John my service adviser was excellent. He made sure I got the best price on my service. He even recommended a warranty repair. He said that he remembered seeing an email about a repair that would be covered under the car's warranty. So he suggested that we get it completed while the warranty was still in force. I am sure this saved me a lot of money down the road. I strongly recommend going to Honda City for your repairs. Additionally, they run service specials all the time. So they will often be a good deal.]
