[113733807740045759667,100933307487423122458,I just recently moved and thought I would try Banfield because it is in a convenient location for me. Worst mistake ever. The customer service of the staff is horrible besides the front desk. They are rude and try to belittle you. From how they act it is clear that they do not care about the pets or their owners. They tried to talk me into getting a bunch of services and tests done that weren't needed, and getting all this medication for my cat "just in case this is what he has." Also, the services that I did agree to that I knew were actually needed, were about twice the price of my previous veterinary clinic. Not to mention the exam fees and the "hospital charges," which were also overpriced. They also said I have to come back and do all the same tests in 15 days, then a month, then every three months. No way am I spending a few hundred dollars with them that often. Time to move on to a clinic that has staff who aren't rude and actually care about the well being of their patients rather than trying to sell you everything.]
