[109984844211823641762,100620945775519830806,I've been bringing my cars (one classic Italian sports car, one Toyota Prius) to Barry at Black Bear for the past four years, and I've never been disappointed with the work done there. If I need him to diagnose a problem, Barry will call me in a few hours and explain it to me in plain English, and what my options are. His prices are very reasonable and the work is done quickly. I can't recommend him highly enough.]
