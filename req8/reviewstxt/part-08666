[110428644226468932188,100621890009990808691,We had a blast on Viking - (we are about 60 yrs old). We opted for the Danube Waltz. It was sort of "spur of the moment" - just a few months off. Viking gave us options to control our air flight (for a little extra charge) and to add on a tour at the beginning or end of our cruise. We did that. We added a trip to Prague. The cruise was really interesting as were the other 142 folks on the ship. We got to know a lot of them as we had so much time, tours, and meals together. I thought the tours were fabulous. And they were included in the price, so that was easy. I took a ton of great photos that helped me re-live this trip over and over, and wish for more. We'd done ocean cruises to Europe before, and loved the experience, but this way we saw much more, and at a better price. Sure there were some bumps in expectations due to low water in the Danube, but Viking more than made up for it; they take the best care of their clients and I strongly recommend them.]
