[102075613266858515289,100694050644540639860,I purchased a bed frame from Wolf Furniture. The bed frame cost 400 dollars. It is very poorly constructed. The wood is not solid, it is hollow. The finish on the frame is not well done. There are portions that have a different color from a lack of time spent doing the job. It took four weeks for this bed frame to arrive after I ordered it and the quality is so poor that it should not have cost more than 100 dollars. This furniture store is, by far, the worst store I have shopped at.]
