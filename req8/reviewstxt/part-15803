[116452061919085929891,101010552346451976386,If you are an actual food lover, don't go here. It is uninspired, dated, dark, and way overpriced. Those the claim to be picky about their food must not eat at fine dining establishments much. This place is not much better than a roadside diner with linen tablecloths. The decor is awful, the table settings are cheap (the sour cream came in a paper diner cup), and whole place reeks of late 70s/early 80s vintage remnants. It's just awful.]
