[100793472713125717080,101112169477007765882,Was here recently for niece's birthday party. Very impressed with the recent renovations; looks (and smells!) much cleaner. Even the pizza is markedly improved. The same animatronic characters were a surprise to see (same from when I had my bday parties there 20 years ago), but fun was had by all. Friendly and helpful staff!]
