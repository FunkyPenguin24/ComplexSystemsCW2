[108980049399829985913,100015967187857165520,I chose to get a pizza to-go on the recommendation of a customer of mine. He said that this place had the best pizza ever. I arrived at the end of the night, you could tell that they were getting ready to clean up from an earlier rush. The pizza was made quickly, although I was one of few people there at the moment, and the service was friendly. I cannot claim that this was the best pizza I have ever had. I'm sorry, just being honest; however, it was the best thin-crust pizza that I've ever had. The dough was wasn't so crispy that it shattered but stiff enough to hold its shape. It didn't taste like flour or a saltine cracker either. It was perfect. The sauce was full of flavor and there was plenty of cheese. They didn't skimp on toppings either. So the food was a total 5 stars for me. The atmosphere seemed nice too. A few tv's up to watch a game, video games for the kids, pool tables for the billiard junkies and a good selection of drinks for those interested in taking the edge off of the evening. I wish there was one in my neighborhood, but there's not. So if you live nearby, go grab a slice then have another for me.]
