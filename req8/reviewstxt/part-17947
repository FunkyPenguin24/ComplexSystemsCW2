[117515881859745563890,101126226710566561379,The staff was friendly, helpful, and completely tolerant of our eager and active two year old. We weren't even sure they'd be able to look at his mouth let along clean his teeth, but the doctor did a great job of working with our son. They generally go at the pace of the child and don't force anything. Thankfully, he was calm enough to get a full checkup and even a little bit of cleaning. The place is very kid-friendly and parent-friendly, allowing both my wife and I to accompany our son. They gave us some great advice on tooth care and diet, and sent us on our way. And to top it off, because of his age, there was no charge for the visit. Amazing! Based on our first an only visit so far, I'd have to recommend this dentist highly.]
