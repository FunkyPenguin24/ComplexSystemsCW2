[102177147312838059859,100906299140362206921,These guys know trees. I had a giant locust tree looming over my house, and it needed to come down. I met with Matthias, the owner, he was professional and knowledgeable. He answered all my questions straight forward and in detail. While his quote was higher than the others, I went with him because of his professionalism. We scheduled the job three weeks later and the crew showed up in uniform, along with an enormous crane. They worked efficiently, impressive to say the least. Now I don't have to worry about an enormous limb falling on my roof. They took out the stump too. I highly recommend Advantage Tree service, I will only use them in the future.]
