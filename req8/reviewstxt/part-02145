[113503231004705003972,100269775491901020966,My new, favorite cafe in Portland serves up highly distinctive roasts from around the world. I come for the coffee, but the architecture and the staff are wonderful as well. I'm currently drinking their Rwanda, but the Burundi, and the Ethiopian have been excellent. The staff has a lot to say about various growing regions, globally. Finally, they spin some choice vinyl on a turntable. Love this place.]
