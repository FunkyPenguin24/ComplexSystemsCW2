[113707043162819750951,100496798296366021930,I love this place...it's a thrift store but it's nice and organized like a Marshalls or H&M (much better than Ross!). I got a lot of stuff (including boots, a sweater, a cute purse, and an amazing bracelet) for less than $23. I saw some brands there like Prada and Guess...I had to make myself leave the store! Definitely one of the better Thrift stores I've been to.]
