[109150773127399521999,101009497360631665888,I stayed on the Queen Mary for a conference and it was a lot of fun. The food was pretty good at the places we ate, and the staff was very nice. The downside is that the coffee bar can't handle a large crowd, nor can the restaurants, so there were days when we didn't get a chance to eat because they could not accommodate the amount of people actually staying on the ship.]
