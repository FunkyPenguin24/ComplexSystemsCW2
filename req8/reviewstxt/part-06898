[105802431935878804418,100527506449273737739,What a joke took the girls today to see monsters University at 12:30 and we sat in the dark for 1hr 30 mins watching a blank screen. Then we where given pass to come back any time that are only good for 72 hrs. I spent $31.25 on popcorn soda and to kids packs for nothing. And what made it bad was how it was handled. The staff there has no training on how to deal with this kind of stuff. I will never waste another dime on such a poor excuse of a movie Theater.]
