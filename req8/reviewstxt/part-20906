[103280783870480094310,100108250153639435011,The 6th street location is very nice, good quality product and atmosphere that doesn't look cheap and quick like competition. The service, however, is lacking friendliness. I found that the staff treats its friends and regulars great but newcomers are frowned upon. I have been coming here since 2010 for every friday night open mic night and poetry singing. Snacks is very as is everyone else except employed staff I enjoy coming here and probably will for a long time. The coffee, bagels and quiche are all great. Just wish service wasn't so moody and inconsistent.]
