[104413802787023283923,100124498475592223298,I was recommended by my friends and i must say that this is one of the rare aircon company in Singapore that is certainly honest. I request for a chemical overhaul which will cost me $150 per unit but they told me that i don't need to pay so much because my aircon are still very clean and they did general aircon servicing for me and i paid only $35 each unit x 3 = $140. Very honest and professional. I will certainly recommend Singapore Aircon Services to anyone!]
