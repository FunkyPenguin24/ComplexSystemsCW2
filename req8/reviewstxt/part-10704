[105082601342901250353,100731716467833872935,The service SUCKS. I made an order for 144 cupcakes. thats ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR beige cupcakes for my sister baby shower (for a boy I may add) we get there to pick them up. They hand us 12 (TWELVE!!) pink freakin cupcakes. -___- and instead of apologizing and getting to work they decided to argue -__- (wait but the argument -- not about that we got 12 instead of 144) the woman wanted to argue that the color wasnt pink -- thats their version of beige. -- we just stood there and waiting almost 2 hours for them to decorate 144 chocolate cupcakes and they didnt even offer a discount smh. HORRIBLE never again. apparently its not the first time my friend order for a sweet 16 and they got the order all wrong as well and began to argue. screw them]
