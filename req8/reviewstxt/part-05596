[105643096806783435155,100455843010529152649,Terrible. Over charged for our stay and WAY too many complaints. when we got there, there was a dead rat on our roof. The upstairs shower leaked to downstairs and had two settings: hot or cold. The down stairs shower was very touchy and almost impossible to get to a useable temperature. the lady at the front desk was VERY rude and unaccommodating. There was no real maid service. Our fridge had no shelves in the door so it was hard to store things. I'll stop here but out list of complaints went on and on. P.S. don't believe the bottom review. It was left by the owner of the place just to have a good review.]
