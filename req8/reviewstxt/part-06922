[108003158107615275151,100529233751978405391,What a fabulous experience. Generally, I hate shopping but in about an hour, Jill sketched out the design of an outfit for one son's wedding. And because there's a second wedding in a month, she figured out how to adjust that first suit to be different for the second event. What great fun! A perfect fit. I may never shop in a regular store again!]
