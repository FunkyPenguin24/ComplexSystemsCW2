[112798806102861792400,100440577470047958087,My family and I have been training with Nico at the Phoenix/Glendale location of Fitness Works since June 2013. We have all had great results! When I signed up for training I wasn't quite sure what to expect but I have been pleasantly surprised nonetheless. Nico is a motivator, without being a drill sergeant. He encourages you to do your best without being condescending. He will even make you laugh in the middle of a set of reps just to keep things light and remind you that working out can (and should) be fun. Nico has the personality that allows him to push you without seeming pushy and encourage you without seeming that he is preaching to you. As much as he tortures us (which is what is seems like during training), we enjoy the sessions and are pleased with the results, not just in weight loss but in building muscle, gaining strength and balance, and just overall improving our health and well-being. I would highly recommend personal training with Nico at the Phoenix/Glendale location of Fitness Works.]
