[102622140693875185769,100024548273816673603,I have been coming to Pangea 25 years now. I know the owners, Arnaldo and Stephen over 30 years now. They are amazing, warm and the service is out of this world. When I come to Pangea its like going to family for dinner because you know its going to be a great evening with outstanding food and good company. The decor with the beautiful art work surrounding the restaurant makes the feel of the room, intimate and inviting. My favorite appetizer is goat cheese and beet salad, seared Salmon for dinner is one of my favorite. The menu changes with the season which is a great touch. my favorite dessert used to be tiramisu but haven't had it for a while since it has not been on the menu and hoping to see it again soon. Everything about Pangea is wonderful along with the special events that they support. New Years eve is a wonderful treat at Pangea. If you have never spent it here, you should try it. These guys have been in the restaurant business over 30 years and know how to do it right. If I lived in the East Village i would go broke eating out every day at Pangea. Since I live on the Upper West Side, its a nice treat to come to the East Village Neighborhood for a nice evening out for dinner , brunch or for a get together with friends for drinks and appetizer. The price is right, so ease on down to the East Village and enjoy eats at Pangea, you will enjoy it.]
