[111849344016559250890,100021242562313398961,Absolutely the best orthodontic team around! Dr. Enoch and his entire staff are professional, extremely helpful, fun and knowledgeable. My daughter loves going to the office and the appointments are always on time. Dr. Enoch does not recommend any procedures that are not necessary and I never feel pressured or rushed. From the first appointment where the entire process and timeline was discussed to the most recent appointment, our experiences have been nothing but positive. I would recommend the Enoch team to anyone!]
