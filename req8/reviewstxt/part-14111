[104747097314308666348,100918065670645157521,Fusion is one of the best casual dining restaurants in the Fort Walton Beach area! Unassuming from the outside, once inside you'll feel like you are in a hip bistro in San Francisco or Chicago. Fusion offers Latin, Asian and American "bento" boxes as well as salads and soups, including excellent wonton soup made with delicious homemade wonton (if you like spicy, don't forget to ask for a side of Sriracha hot sauce to stir in!). With the bentos, you get an entree and side salad with a ginger vinaigrette, then choose noodles or rice (or some come with chips and salsa), plus one more side (the grilled zucchini is my favorite). All for around $7.50-$9! I have been there dozens of times and go back every chance I get. Try it, you'll LOVE it!]
