[113200180495399232019,101047492069290848372,They took three hours to change my oil and do a vehicle inspection yesterday. They tried to sell me on at least four repairs that were over $100 a piece (some that I had just done recently and definitely didn't need), and then tried twice to get me to open a Firestone credit card to pay for their outrageously expensive services. These guys are salespeople through and through and didn't seem to really care about me as a customer.]
