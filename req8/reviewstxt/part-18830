[110456915025408537145,101174120614014232648,Beware!!! The health department should shut this place down. 8 of us ended up with severe diarrhea after eating here. We should have walked out when the waitress brought 8 plates to our table and all of them had food stuck to them. The silverware needed to be sent back twice. The Asst Manager stands there barking orders at her staff. She is so rude to them. In her defense, she has the most incompetent staff I have ever seen. They leave tables dirty. People stand waiting to be seated and they are ignored. It has not been scrubbed for a long time. I travel all the time and dont cook. I have eaten from street vendors in Mexico, China, and India and never got sick. This Pizza Hut wins the prize of the worst place in service, cleanliness, and food.]
