[101719129297505614531,100193821696884764204,Three reasons why First Response Systems as an alarm response company is not worried about customer service, and more importantly, customer loyalty:1) President of the company is too busy to talk with a customer about some issues in his company that he may not be aware of. He had other pressing issues "as you can understand."2) The company does not take responsibility for its mistakes or oversights (especially when it was because they had to take over some other alarm companies' issues and system inadequacies...and did not did not find the issue to charge us on the install).3) Despite acknowledging their alarm sensor issue was the cause for multiple false alarms in the middle of the night, the terror of my boys running into the room and requiring consoling were not a cost to FR-Inc. The short-term gains of covering the costs of a technician replacing their faulty sensor outweigh the costs for long-term customer loyalty. I am sure the response that this was not "their system" and therefore "not their fault" and that "I should understand that costs should be shared." Excuses rather than responsibility for their services. "We [bent over backwards] and gave this customer a one-year contract"...when there were only 3 or 4 other companies that would have been happy to have the business in the recession. Good luck to a company where deficiencies in customer service equals no customer loyalty.]
