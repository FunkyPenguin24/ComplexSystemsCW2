[112386076902995801129,100181624669122149958,Our salesman Suvin Viswanathan at Criswell Honda made our car buying experience enjoyable. From the first talk my wife and I had with Suvin about purchasing a vehicle from the dealership, he did not play the normal dealer games that some sales people use. He treated us with respect and honesty, and we hold that in high regard. When it came time to talk vehicle price, he gave us his best price first and there were no high pressure tactics applied to purchase the vehicle as soon as the price was given. This gave us the sense that the timetable to purchase the vehicle was ours, and not the dealer's. Again my wife and I respect this type of treatment. When my wife and I were ready to purchase, the price remained what was quoted and the whole process was quick and enjoyable. I need to also say that manager Esteban Mesa was also pleasant to deal with at the dealership.]
