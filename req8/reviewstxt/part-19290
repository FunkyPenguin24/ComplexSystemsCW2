[110918545515676923656,100022109795281976980,I cannot say enough good things about this small little Bistro in Louisville, Colorado. The food is delicious, and at this point, I consider myself a regular. Open for breakfast and lunch, I normally get breakfast regardless of the time. The crab benedict is out of this world, with another favorite being the simple egg sandwich. If I'm in the mood for lunch, one cannot go wrong with the chicken sandwich and fries! Recently, they began testing the water for dinner service, now on Thursday and Friday nights. I've been three times for dinner, which is tapas style, small plates, and Bistro 4 has yet to disappoint! The dinner menu changes weekly, so be sure to get on their email list - or be adventurous and just show up! Always fun! The dinner vibe has a more "hipster" feel, and the cocktails are unique and stylish! If you visit in the Fall or Winter, try the homemade eggnog! WOW! Overall, the food is fantastic, the service spot on and whether you're a local or visiting, Bistro 4 is one to add to your list. J~]
