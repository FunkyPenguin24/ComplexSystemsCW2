It's the best quality restaurant in town. Food prices are fair. As far as alcohol prices, they are much higher than market area, although selection is far better than their competition. Service has many kinks. They are often very slow, even outside of peak times. To go time ranges are often off by 20-30 minutes past the projected times. Overall, its a good restaurant. Just be prepared to wait -- and then wait. But, it certainly is -- worth the wait.]
