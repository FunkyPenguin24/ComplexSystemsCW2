[108380375534804604663,100858093242063898342,This place is terrible. I've been there a few times. The last time I went I ordered a drink, and was standing next to the wall minding my own business. Some girl who worked there walked up to me and hit my drink out of my hand spilling it all over me. She did it on purpose, and then I was escorted out. I had no idea who she was, and I wasn't causing any problems whatsoever. To say the least...I was very surprised and disappointed by their service. Hopefully Logan opens more bars in the future so that people aren't forced to go to crappy places like this.]
