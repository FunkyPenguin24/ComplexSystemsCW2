But unlike some of the horror stories I have read in the reviews it was more than adequate. The room was comfortable, clean and relative quiet for its location. Check in was quick, efficient, and the staff friendly. I did not partake in the continental breakfast as I left early in the morning but my overall impression is that I would not hesitate to stay their again for their bargain price and location.]
