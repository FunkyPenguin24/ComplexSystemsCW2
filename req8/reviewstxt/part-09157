[109850956148441312109,100647116190662669680,I would take a massage at Equilibria over a new pair of shoes any day of the week. Really. The atmosphere is incredibly welcoming and very comfortable. I had a massage last week and I left giggling, and continued to smile for hours, because I felt good, lighter and relaxed. I have done a number of things to my back over the years, and it lets me know. So, when i start daydreaming of a massage, it's time for me to get one, in fact, Iâ€™m probably overdue. It's a quality experience and you feel the attention to detail and consideration. Absolutely wonderful, good for the body and the soul.]
