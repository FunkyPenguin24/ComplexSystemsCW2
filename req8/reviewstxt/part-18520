[114165727012378171996,101157219646270027764,I moved here back in September from 3 hours away. Automatically when I needed medicine refilled I used Walgreens as always. I have NEVER dealt with a pharmacy soooooooooo slow. I thought maybe it was the day however everytime since has been the same. There are times I travel so Walgreens is convenient, however I am so close to finding a new location. If anyone can recommend a better location in Peru area please contact me. With as much money we spend on medication each month any pharmacy would love to have us.]
