[106055951449114236523,100014414076606569954,Coming from South Africa we found that the accommodation at Quest Warrnambool was great. It was self-catering, spacious and well equipped. Great to have a washing machine and dryer as well iron and ironing board. All these home conveniences made travelling easy and enjoyable. And everything was in excellent condition, clean and neat.]
