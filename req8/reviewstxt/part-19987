[110893770729631798016,100059396867077860996,Friendly staff, immaculately clean dining area and kitchen. Things were quiet when I showed up, but I was helped immediately by the staff and my meal was cooked fresh as I waited. I ordered chicken with sauteed vegetables, hummus and salad for $10. Chicken and vegetables were great, hummus was good, side salad was good too but nothing out of the ordinary. They get bonus points for freshness, everything was cooked as I waited by an older woman who looked like a greek mom who had been cooking for years! The only thing that was unusual was there were french fries included in the vegetables, and I don't recall if french fries - or potatoes - were on the list of ingredients. Overall I will definitely go back. The friendly service, clean restaurant, and cooked to order food were all worth a return trip. Next time I need to get some of their fantastic looking baclava!]
