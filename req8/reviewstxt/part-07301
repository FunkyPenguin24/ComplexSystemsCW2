[100928947512774261892,100549208909226961908,Recently Channel 7, ABC did a piece on Neighborhood Eats and I was fortunate enough to be interviewed. I meant everything I said...the food, service, and the people are great. I totally agree with the other comment about the best Beef Patties in The Bronx! Everything is good! It will be worth the trip!]
