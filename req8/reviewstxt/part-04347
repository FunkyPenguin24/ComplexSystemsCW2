[111840723743245776440,100389528241404476911,HORRIBLE customer service, and misleading representatives. Never return phone calls, and when you ask them for the detail on costs, they refuse to help you. Seems like they were trying to take advantage and when we called them out they didn't want to do our job. After 4 days of running around! Within 2 hours of cancelling service with them, our window was fixed for less than $200!!!]
