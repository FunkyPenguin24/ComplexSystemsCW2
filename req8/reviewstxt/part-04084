[100343029872053875991,100374088979930777169,This is where I get my tires. This is where I get my inspection. This is NOT where I get my bullsh!t. If they delivered babies here my wife would have come home w an oily daughter. I would NOT go anywhere else. Some folks may think the place looks sketchy, I think it looks like a garage because that's what it is. The folks here do what folks at garages do and don't F you around. Fast and polite and professional. There's sometimes a line but that's because there's resolution without shifty crap at the the end. I'm not kicking your crotch, if you go here you won't ever go anywhere else. The Manger might even drink a beer w you while you wait. While I was there my first time I saw him send some of his people up on the freeway right above them to rescue a woman in her children who had broken down in the Texas heat. Course it didn't matter if it was in the Texas spring . He had been towed to place for free and did not obligate them to use his services other than that. gave the kids some soft drinks and got her to a phone. Your first visit you'll be waiting for the other shoe to drop because everything seems too easy as most stuff nowadays is not especially when it involves money and services. The only thing that drops are your keys in your hand and your level of anxiety. It's great to have it so close and they're open till midnight. Holy crap, use these guys]
