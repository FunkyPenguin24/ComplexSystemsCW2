[109601647180945755503,101013451550392200674,Our grandfather is suffering from parkingson's dissease and this conpany has given us the security and trust that we were looking for him. He is 76 years old and we are not always available as we do work 9-5. Advancare offered us the possibility of sending us a professionally trained caregiver that is with him throughout the day. The caregiver takes him out for a walk (when it's not that hot) she does the grocery shipping for the house with him so that he gets distracted. She is extremely polite and responsible. Parkingson's dissease is hard as they person with it can not do activities for too long. That's why someone should be there in care our grandfather needs to go back home. Im glad that we found Advancare, it's been over a year with their service and we can say we are 100% satisfied!]
