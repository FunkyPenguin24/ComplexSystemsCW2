[103173250755636484300,100532075233853788707,I bought a 2013 Honda Accord from this dealership. Since then, I've taken it back for basic routine maintenance. Every time I came here, the staff made me feel welcome, treating me with courtesy. The salespeople aren't paid on commission, unlike most dealerships. Therefore, they go out of their way to help you find the best car according to your needs. Even better, they are knowledgeable about the products they sell, unlike some dealers, where it seems like they have nothing but canned information from a website. The service department is fast and efficient. Plus, they have a nice waiting room with free coffee. Never had any complaints - they are professionals. If you want a great car, possibly the best car for the price, get a Honda. And if you're going to buy a Honda, go to Planet Honda. Truly among the best.]
