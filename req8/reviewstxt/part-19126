[105836519731681470790,100012297143565208578,We have been going to this Jason's for the past 12 years and have enjoyed dining there. The last few times we have gone things have changed. Unacceptable things that we are now experiencing are food all over the floor, no clean glasses available, no utensils, no clean saucers for things like cornbread puffs, etc. It gives me the feeling of being in a facility that is in the final stage of going out of business.]
