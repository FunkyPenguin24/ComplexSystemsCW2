[105764919654547765137,100422094732607035037,I stayed here on 7-2-13 and the place looks nice and the front desk lady was helpfull but when we finally got into our room about 9:15 we noticed that we only had a full sized bed and not the Queen that we paid for. So the next morning I said something to the young man who was working the desk and he looked at me like what is the problem? So i decided to call the next day when the manager was on duty and she had the balls to tell me what i slept in was a queen bed. I know how big a queen is i have one at home. I will never stay here again.]
