[115454562632868928914,100563005947348541230,Really enjoyed my time at Lakeside today. It was one of several attempts to find a decent barbershop that does straight blade shaves. Mike took very good care of me and had a great sense of humor. I can't vouch for the others, but everyone there seemed more than capable. I got a cut and a shave, and the price was very reasonable. I will be going back when I'm in this area if for nothing else the shave. The reason that I did not give a perfect score is that even though the shop is clean and setup nicely, it doesn't have a rustic, manly feel that a perfect shop has, in my opinion. Secondly, my skin is very sensitive, and, this was not the very best shave I've ever had. Maybe I have impossibly high standards. That said, I will return to Mike. He did a fantastic job, and I really appreciate his service.]
