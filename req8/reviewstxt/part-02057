[117498317022575591694,100265251966756608807,I have went to a local Gamestop today. They had the Wii U on display. I played Rayman Legends for a few minutes. It was hard to put the controller down. It was so much fun. I could have played for hours. Thank you Nintendo. You are awesome. I have a suggestion for the Wii U. Please make it have a big sale during the Christmas holidays. It would be good for a lot of families. Thank you for putting the Wii U on display for Gamestop. Please put the real box art of games to Gamestop soon. Thank you for being so awesome.]
