[100259488062155607354,100882936134349739798,Strickland Funeral Home is an A+ funeral home. Sean and the other staff members were very kind and took me under their wings. Sean took control of everything and my family was so glad. My Mom(Billie Dove Hopkins Wood) died October 2004 and my sister (Valerie Kay Wood Dillard) died May 2004. Strickland handed both funerals. My Dad (Joseph Daniel Wood) passed away February 20 2012. Guess who did the funeral? If you said Strickland, you are right. When I leave this world I know Sean will help Tom, Matt and Kenya, Melissa and Justin and my sweet,[], sweet grandchild Julianne.]
