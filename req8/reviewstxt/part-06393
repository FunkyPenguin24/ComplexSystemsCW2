[117956217396419799175,100498202826597095885,Some friends and I came here on my birthday to grab some quick food before going out. The drinks were really watered down and expensive, plus they took forever to get to the table after we saw them sitting at the bar well for five minutes. The food was very unappealing. I got boneless wings, and they tasted like cheap, frozen, microwaved imitation chicken. My friend asked our server for extra ranch four times, then went up to the bartender to ask, and never got it. After we got back to my house, we all got sick and weren't even able to have a good night. Birthday ruined!! Enough of my vent, long story short; food sucked, service sucked, I'm not dining there again..]
