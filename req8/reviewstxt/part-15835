[114373659600589435978,101012074427509537656,I do not know how anyone could be giving this place a bad review. The food here is superb. The staff is always friendly, although service is not always quick. Just relax and enjoy the slower pace. The food here takes time because it is made to order. The Dum Aloo is the best I have ever had, the Kaju Curry is out of this world delicious, and the Mulligatawny Soup is amazing. Also try the Paneer Tikka and the Masala Dossa, both are fantastic. Really, everything I have ever had here is wonderful!]
