[112130583222855560942,100437569733428778956,If you love American Diner style food, airplanes and aviation, the Flight Deck is the place to go for lunch. It's a family owned and operated place, so the service is always good and the food is always done right. Best of all, the place embraces its location at the Phoenix-Mesa Gateway Airport (formerly Williams Field Air Force Base). There are tons of well constructed model planes of all vintages hanging from the ceiling, you can have lunch or breakfast and frequently see business jets, military transport planes and fighter and attack jets coming & going on the ramp right outside the restaurant. As a great bonus for aviation, military and history buffs, the north wall is decorated with the unit insignia, slogans and signatures of the pilots stationed at the base. If you haven't been there, especially if you have kids, it's truly the worth the trip.]
