[112952889143279090334,100059945437699766336,I'm not the same person since I started here a couple years ago. Having been more of a scientist agnostic most of my life, I came for help after what some would call an "awakening," chocked full of sudden psychic experiences, with all its initial bliss, confusion & fear. With the myriad valuable survival tools I've learned from Miwa & Mary, my 3 most integral personal basic concepts I've carried away are: A). I'm not crazy (for seeing things that others don't) B). “We are not human beings having a spiritual experience. We are spiritual beings having a human experience.”― Pierre Teilhard de Chardin (even though I've read this in everything from Dr. Wayne Dyer to O Magazine... having a direct experience with this concept changes one's perceptions beyond literary logic) C). I've grown exponentially, as an artist, a psychic & as a human being. I'm learning to set free old habits of questioning myself, my own intuition & the presence of endless helping hands in the universe... and discovering the raw truth of our innermost being: L❤VE! I can't say enough about this psychic kindergarten-to-graduate school. It's a safe sandbox of play & healing with teachers who hold your hand, guide you straight through your own obstacles, eyes wide open, and show you how to see your own gifts more clearly :)]
