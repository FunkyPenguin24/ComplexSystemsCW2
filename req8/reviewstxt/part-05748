[106763712516562221412,100463739082949297404,I had the lumberjack breakfast. The eggs, potatoes, and bacon tasted like they were all cooked in the same reused oil. And you can't pat the oil off the potatoes? I think people like this place for the hip and trendy look. It's got that "hole-in-the-wall feel, but hey, our waiters have retro hair" style,. The coffee was so-so. It had a slight taste of dirt - like the mug or pot hadn't been washed in awhile. I honestly think IHOP does a better breakfast.]
