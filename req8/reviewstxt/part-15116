[112218381296023399169,100972911962950915675,Our experience at Kay Dental Care has been excellent. Dr. Kaler gives you the time that is required to understand and digest information related to your exam. I took my mother in law for her evaluation and not only did he do his due diligence, he actually took the time to explain things thoroughly. Also, gave his expert opinion and gave us time to think on next steps. I am very satisfied with the service and overall experience has been great. I highly recommend Kay Dental Care.]
