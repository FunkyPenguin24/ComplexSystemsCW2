[100365982075090450975,100014599373215511403,James came out promptly to see an extremely heavy metal oil tank that needed removing. We arranged a date for collection. On the arranged day James and his son arrived on time to remove the tank. Despite its weight the tank was loaded onto the truck and taken away as required. James communicated well throughout the job, arrived in a large clean truck and did exactly what he said he would do. I can highly recommend this company.]
