[117324109830043586411,100153884360462737220,LOVE this place! All the girls are sweet and helpful- even if the salon can get a little crowded and/or busy. It's truly a "neighborhood" nail shop experience- join the conversation and get to know some people! Just by chance, had my first-ever Shellac mani with McKenzie and it was SO gorgeous...but I didn't realize that hers happen to be the BEST IN TOWN. I've had Shellac done at three other salons for various reasons, and nobody even comes close to the finished product of her work- I'm hooked. I can and DO recommend this salon to anyone!]
