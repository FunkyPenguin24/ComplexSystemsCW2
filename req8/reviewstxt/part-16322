[111141628079272290976,101037633099073754048,I can understand some of the less favorable reviews on here- the customer service isn't always the best depending on when you go in or why you are there- but I really had a very good overall experience purchasing my wedding dress recently and a great experience with alterations. They were patient, kind and made my dress fit perfectly down to the last detail. If I had to do it over again, I would do it the same.]
