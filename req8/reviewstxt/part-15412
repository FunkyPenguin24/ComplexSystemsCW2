[101639667879950705254,100988304366558634018,Excellent pizza. Most certainly the best pizza in Upland. Thick, chewy crust that's crispy on the bottom, excellent quality toppings that are plentiful and very good pizza sauce that's not overly spiced or tangy. 1,000 times better than the corporate pizza places! It's mostly a take-out joint, but there are places to sit. The service is very good and the decor is fine for a small pizza joint. Disabled parking spot right in front which is great for me since I'm disabled. Trust me, don't pass this place up! Give it a shot! :)]
