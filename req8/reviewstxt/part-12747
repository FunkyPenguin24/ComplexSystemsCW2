[101483854021566843676,100843023027449384402,Waited 2 hours for inedible food. Too few staff (all Asian) and uncomfortable seats. When the food arrived - mine was allegedly cannelloni - the meat was an indistinguishable grey over-peppered paste inside a tasteless pasta tube, covered with what tasted like bulk-bought pizza topping. The whole lot was slathered in stringy cheese which was also underneath the pasta for some reason, and glued it to the plate. I ate about half and, judging by the what was left on the plates of the rest of our party, nobody else had better luck. Avoid at all costs.]
