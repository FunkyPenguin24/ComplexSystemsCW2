[102417117296961848379,100954020119682703799,Angelo's has been a favourite of our family for many years. Because it is a "Mom & Pop" restaurant, you don't get "franchise" food, you get delicious, home-made food. Prices are competitive, service is great (both eat-in and take-out). No one makes a better cheesecake! If you don't have room for cheesecake after eating the generous portions of the main course, take one home for later.]
