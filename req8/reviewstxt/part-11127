I know they do a lot better in the summer time when they open their bar "garage door" and people are out bar hopping, but this place is so fantastic I feel sad that they aren't packed every weekend. Who knows, maybe I'm going on the wrong days. Anyway... the food... Dale (owner and chef) is a phenomenal culinary artist. Now, maybe it's not as ridiculously fancy as a 5 star New York restaurant, but for small town Waukesha, it's a diamond in the rough. Not only are the dishes unique and full of fantastic flavor contrasts and combinations, the food is attractively plated with colorful garnishes and the portion size is just right... if you want to hate yourself after a meal go to Golden Corral. Overall, this place is so good and I would love to go there and have to wait for a table... cause that would mean people are giving it the recognition it deserves!]
