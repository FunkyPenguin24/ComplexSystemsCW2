[103006119068440529726,100903467062740565426,This store was pretty good when it opened, however the range of bikes and equipment has been watered down to low-quality chinese made brands selling at prices that are way too high. In my opinion they are cashing in on the uninformed buyers out there who just want to stroke their ego by buying at a shop that gives that "extreme" image. Honestly? Forget the "extreme", most of the bikes they sell (dwindling numbers of top-end Jamis bikes excluded) would fall apart after a few weeks of mild road use.]
