[102937582749868727758,100600579516639882746,We were impressed with what Envision had to offer and with a better price than the ADT which we already had. The rep. was very professional and very clear with presenting the information which we required. The switch over was very simple and the install went smoothly. There was a glitch when setting the perimeter, however it was corrected with the wireless system. So far we have been extremely satisfied even though it has only been a week. We really appreciate the 2 key fobs at no extra cost. ADT wanted almost a hundred dollars for the second fob. They charged us extra each month to have the cell phone number as a back up. Thank you envision for such good service and pricing.]
