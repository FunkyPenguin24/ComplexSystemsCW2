[100606848072782693145,100732243698016739501,I haven't had good experiences with these guys. They recently charged me Â£178 to service my bike, there were various charges applied that were not made clear at the time I made my booking and they weren't overly contrite about it. Very poor customer service, they seemed to do a decent job on the bike though.]
