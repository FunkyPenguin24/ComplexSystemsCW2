[108945429718254162427,100278311864534569382,Brian, Paul, Josh, and crew were very hospitable. They installed a Bluetooth/XM Ready radio with special harness for steering wheel controls in my 2007 MINI Cooper S. While actual install time went over due to issues out of their control, they were super awesome and let me know what was going on the whole time. Their install was clean and professional and the radio looks great in the car. If you want a local company who will take their time to ensure that EVERYTHING is up to your expectations, give them a call.]
