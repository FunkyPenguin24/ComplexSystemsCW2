[102711324977431268356,100112441368008560831,My family and I have been enjoying this place for years. It is a perfect example of an old-style neighborhood business where the owner and staff are very friendly, appreciate your business, and keep you coming back with consistently good food, good service and a pleasant atmosphere. An all around good value. Their Hot and Sour soup (a personal barometer of Chinese restaurants) is among the best I've had. Kitchen will gladly accommodate requests like 'Extra-Spicy' and similar. The popular lunch buffet is small but much fresher than most. Only drawback is no liquor license. If you feel like a drink with dinner, this isn't the place.]
