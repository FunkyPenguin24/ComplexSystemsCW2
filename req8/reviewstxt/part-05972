[103549047457401810712,100475640429719620589,I went to see this doctor with my wife for simple immunizations shots as we were traveling abroad for two months. We were told he doesn't take insurance after the fact of getting the injections. That it would be $600 out of pocket, which is completely overpriced but again Health Care system is corrupt. I paid 100% of the bill upfront. I came home after our trip to find out Dr. Daniel Caplivski, MD decided to charge us even more money. This wasn't discussed and you should beware of this doctor he will SCAM you! He is now trying to earn an extra $300 extra after the services was completed and paid for. He will take advantage of people, avoid at all cost. AVOID like the plague.]
