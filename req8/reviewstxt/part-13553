[101322119895921982509,100888039009393398874,I visited the White Magnolia at their Tampa location. The store manager, Ashley, was absolutely amazing! I brought a pretty big crowd with me, but she acclimated them just fine and made everyone feel welcome and comfortable. We tried on SO many dresses, but Ashley didn't mind. She was fast at helping me and keeping the store looking neat at the same time. She was so sweet and knew exactly when to say something to help me decide between a couple dresses. I was able to narrow it down to about 3 and was really torn. Ashley didn't rush me and said just the right things to help me make up my mind, all without being pushy! It was an amazing experience and I definitely would recommend this place to any and every bride I know!]
