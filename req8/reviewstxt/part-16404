[103723828051847470481,101042092550121678189,I just had my wisdom teeth taken out here. On my first visit the doctor explained everything about the procedure and helped me fully understand what was going to be done. After the procedure was completed he even called me to see how I was doing. I can't say enough good things about this office. The staff is so friendly and experienced. They really work as a team. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Wilson!]
