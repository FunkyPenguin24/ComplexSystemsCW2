[102056602121671424357,100730148908474065177,This is a beautiful range nestled in the mountains near Castle Rock State Park. It is well maintained and the Range Safety Officers are there for YOUR protection. I've seen many families come up here to teach their children to treat guns with respect and learn how to shoot the right way. Definitely a "must" for any gun enthusiast!]
