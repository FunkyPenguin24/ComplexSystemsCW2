[100967691004911467161,100972097143524866295,I have been going to Gentle Dental in Braintree for the last 7-8 years. I recently broke a tooth and called the next morning as soon as they opened. I got an appointment first thing that morning and had work underway to fix the problem that afternoon. Dr Shapiro was great going over my options and got everything in place to take on some challenging work.]
