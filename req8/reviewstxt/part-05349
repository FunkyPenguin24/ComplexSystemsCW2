[111942749545801255513,100443902105912814775,Probably the best Mexican food in Buffalo. Definitely a must try if you enjoy Mexican food. I'll be honest, the tables are always sticky and first time I went in I was skeptical but the excellent quality of the food keeps us coming back! Never ordered a bad dish. Prices are low, portions are big, and service is fast fast fast! We joke that they must know what we want before we walk in the door they're so fast!]
