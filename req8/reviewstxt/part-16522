I agree with the reviewer who said there should be a better catalog, so you could get information on any object, not just one or two per room. But even so, there is a lot to enjoy aesthetically and also in terms of human interest. For example, Napoleon hated the Canova statue, which depicted him as a naked Hercules, and made his actual average height look short and squat by comparison. The moment he saw it, Napoleon banished it to the basement of the Louvre. So of course, what object does Wellington make sure to bring home and feature in his main stairwell? Seemingly nice but profoundly insulting. And so on. Really, go!]
