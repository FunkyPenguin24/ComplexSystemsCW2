[103542873556006880714,100604850765562064063,I've been to Paint Along several times and love it. I don't understand people who want to complain because they wanted the rules to change for them or expect a small business to make a policy change just for them. The lady that owns this studio is awesome and very funny. If anyone has a 'bad' experience it might be because they didn't get their way or special attention and NOT because of the studio itself. Try it and you'll see that this place is AWESOME!!!]
