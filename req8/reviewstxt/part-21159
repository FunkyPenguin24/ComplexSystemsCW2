[109882764802310440139,100121082686984600676,This (Monday) morning, Fred from Callahan's came to service our Electrolux clothes washer. This is a high-end washer, and he knew everything about it. Our issue was the lack of water pressure pushing on the fabric softener dispenser tray, plus the yucky issue of black gunk (which he said was mold) which had coated some of the parts in the tray. So he replaced some little part and then advised us how to clean out the mold and accumulated junk - (hint: this is something that should be done monthly): wash it with a bleach vinegar mix, scrub with a toothbrush, high pressure hosing etc. I had already used a straight bleach rinsing solution, and told Fred a trick he had not heard about - run the dispenser tray through the dishwasher (no heat added). In the end, the dispenser is clean, and my wife is happy. That's the important moral of the story. Fred was friendly, knew his stuff, and very helpful.]
