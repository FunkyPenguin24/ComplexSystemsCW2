[100532580564389534235,100695840677587355120,Out of all my frequent visits to this Zara location, most have been met at quite unpleasant terms. Majority of the staff is quite. . . unkind. Well, thats one way to put it. Not what I would call polite, nor helpful, but not fully rude. The place is a little too dark for my liking, and the men's section could be a tad extended. Overall, OK; however, I don't intend to go back anytime soon.]
