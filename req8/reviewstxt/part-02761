[108612139291350798610,100301379808468251581,My husband bought a new Nissan Sentra from Gary back in 2003. His experience was so positive that we decided to return our business with Bommarito Nissan to trade in the Sentra for a 2012 Rogue. Matt was very professional & clearly had experience in dealing with car sales. He treated us well from the very beginning & never haggled with us on price. He understood our budget and worked in our favor to bring the price down to what we can afford while still getting us into a new car. Kyle was also very professional & courteous as he also worked with our budget for the extended warranty. Both Matt & Kyle were patient & understanding with our toddler as they have little ones of their own. Thank you to everyone at Bommarito for making my family feel important & giving us an overall positive experience!]
