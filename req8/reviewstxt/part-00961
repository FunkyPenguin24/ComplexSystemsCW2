[101209866637836937806,100208849142961831684,The team of doctors and staff are phenomenal. The oncology department, there are no words to describe how I feel. They are friendly, professional, caring, compassionate and determined. I have to say like any other hospital, you will find some unfriendly people no matter where you go...overlooking that, I have to say UAB Hospital deserves its praises. The place is beautiful, clean and HUGE,.My mother a cancer patient was treated with the best care, The doctors work diligently in getting our mother health back on track. I would recommend UAB Hospital to anyone.. This is my first visit to the hopsital and I was completely satisified... You be the judge..........THANK YOU UAB,[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],[],]
