[114916084258093619123,100035240486363653040,I have been going to buy all my jewelry from Dan and his Dad for over 10 years. They listen to what you want and their custom designs are unique. My daughter had her engagement and wedding ring made their too. All work is done in house so you don't have to worry about anything happening to your jewels on repairs too. I wouldn't go anywhere else]
