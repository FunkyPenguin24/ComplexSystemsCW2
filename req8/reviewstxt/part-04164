[103337300904149449691,100379598030992160253,Compared to carboard box rental/purchase services beetleboxes are reasonably priced and much more practical + environmentally friendly. Beetleboxes saved us on removalist costs - so much faster to pack and stack than cardboard boxes! No mess to deal with afterwards, once the boxes were picked up. Because the beetleboxes are so sturdy, they are easier to pack and we ended up using much less packing material too. Our move ended up going wrong and we had to extend by a week - which also wasn't a problem. I'd highly recommend Beetlebox to anyone moving!]
