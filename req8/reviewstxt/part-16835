[103191282042721020720,101065407585613878431,Bought a car and the next day the check engine light came on and we took it to a mechanic and nine different codes popped up in the diagnostic, and they had said if anything came up within three days and we weren't satisfied we could get our money back (we paid cash) and we took it and couldn't even get them to cover repair cost.... Worst experience, wouldn't recommend this place to anyone but scam artist who could rip them off]
