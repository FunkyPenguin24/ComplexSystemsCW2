[101803494837859865877,100222588360882423960,I have been going here for about 8 months now, it is "OK" for the options that around this area. First of all the first review on here about the tanning supplies isn't accurate, at least not for me. My contract hasn't changed at all. I purchased my eye protection from them, they have them right behind the counter, along with other items. You should NOT tan without protection, it can cause serious damage to your eyes, they are trying to protect you! *Pros:* Open 24 Hours Lot's of Aerobic Equipment Staff is friendly in my opinion Lots of weight equipment as well. Large Open Space Pretty much empty before 6AM *Cons:* The equipment is not very clean, think they need more staff working on this. Lack of free weights, think this is a Planet Fitness style, to avoid the "Lunks" Almost every ear phone plug for the TV's on the equipment either doesn't work or is too hard to hear. Bathrooms are not very welcoming either. My remaining issue, really isn't anything directly against Planet Fitness. But just gym etiquette in general, for the love of god people rack your weights!@#!]
