[113367808269571712047,101124737365869387670,I have been considering prk surgery for the past 6 years and finally made the leap this year. I am 2 weeks post prk and have never seen the world so clearly. Waking up in the morning and being able to see without the trouble of glasses or contacts is the most amazing experience. After three consultations from three different places, I made the decision to go with TLC and Dr. Holzman. From the moment i walked into the Tysons Corner office i felt welcome and comfortable. The staff was so helpful and put me to ease at each of my appointments. The day of my surgery, I was extremely nervous, however, when I met Dr. Holzman, I immediately felt comfortable. The procedure itself was painless and fast and Dr. Holzman talked me through it the whole time. By the end I was like "That's It?" :) From day 1 I was seeing clearly with some bouts of blurriness. But in the past two weeks, my vision has become so clear and as long as i take the drops as told, my vision is good. Needless to say, I am a very satisfied client and will be recommending Dr. Holzman to anyone who needs lasik or prk. I just wish I'd made this decision 6 years ago :)]
