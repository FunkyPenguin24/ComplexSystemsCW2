[101396629420046689341,100934291338229087452,Repairman arrived on time, was polite, clean and professional. My clothes washer had an intermittent problem which did not occur while he was here. Rather than just leave, he questioned me about the problem, in depth; and then he proceeded to find the cause and fixed it on the spot. Very few repairmen would do this. I highly recommend Jimâ€™s Appliance Repair.]
