[111319824459828533519,100944201618485949126,I don't recommend this salon...It took me 3 separate trial runs for my wedding updue. The first time I went, Liza was unable to braid my hair and I left with no idea how my hair would look on my wedding day. The second time I went, she pawned me off on one of her new hairstylists (even though my apt. was with Liza and I drove over an hour to see her). The hour I was there, the stylist was unable to put my hair up. The last time I went (a week before my wedding) we finally figured it out, and I did love the final result. She quoted me a certain price prior to my booking and on the day of my wedding said she would not honor it because after all I did have 3 trial updues. She refused to give me a receipt, which I called over 4 times for in the course of 6 months, she claimed her computer crashed. In my opinion, the whole situation was unprofessional.]
