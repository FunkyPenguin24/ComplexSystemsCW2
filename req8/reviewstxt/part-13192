[111865204685648492735,100867667182269661417,Admitting that it is a good place to eat Sushi, I am always disappointed by the service there. There was once a bunch of friends gather here and order the buffet. No one attend to us 30 min after we get seated. Most surprising thing is, the first appetizer we ordered finally come, after we paid our bill :( . I notice that there are very few people serving the tables, and that might be why we get this terrible experience. Maybe it will be a better choice for lunch, if it is not so crowded and you have lots of time and great patience.]
