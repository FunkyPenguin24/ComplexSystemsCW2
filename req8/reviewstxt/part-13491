[100782620200847186964,100884795368693668152,I felt dirtier after taking a shower in this room. No coffee maker, microwave, fridge and a TV over 20 years old that had the worst reception possible. The bed was way overdue for a new box spring and mattress. They had absolutely nothing that was positive. My wife and I came all the way from South Dakota and brought some friends of ours with us. They had to pay $90.00 a room and their room was worse than ours! I would NOT recommend this place to ANYONE! You can get a cleaner place to sleep under a bridge off I-70!!!]
