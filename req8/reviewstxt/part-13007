[104065413135271413602,100857236123174026879,I have nothing but good things to say about this place. I first inquired online about the price and selection of the Focus ST's, and within 5 minutes I had an automated response, and 5 minutes after that, I had a personal response and buying options from Hugh Monahan. He was incredibly quick to respond, his answers were succinct and informative, and he was very personable. I work graveyard shift, so any time I need to get something done (like buy a car!), it means I'm staying up well past when I should be sleeping. It was preferable to me to be able to complete the process in one day, and they came through. Hugh transferred the car I wanted up from Olympia that same afternoon! That was HUGE! Also, I traded in my '06 Mazda 3, and they were very fair with the trade in pricing. That also influenced my decision to go ahead with the deal. I didn't NEED a car, but with the price I got for my current car, and the financing/price I got on the new one, it was an easy choice.]
