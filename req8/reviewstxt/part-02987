[109789321505864547770,100313597714951569987,I've known of Pixels for a long time, been renting from them on occasion for the past year or so, but this past week I finally had the opportunity to print with them. The image turned out great! Exactly how it looked on screen, and at 24x36 it was nice to see it so clearly. The employee that helped me with the print was very friendly, we started talking about mattes and she quickly led me over to their section of matte corners where I spent quite a while going through there huge selection. They let me lay my photo out on one of the tables so I could pick just the right matte for the photo. I figured it all out and had them cut the matte. They had to order the matte in but even with that it was 2 days turn-around. Which was fantastic! I could have an image printed matted and framed within days. When I went back in to pick up the matte the employee that helped me was also very friendly. This makes the biggest impression on me, when the people helping me, especially at a place that is for those that do/love something (like photography), clearly enjoy there jobs I am just that much more likely to enjoy my experience and the outcome of the product. This place gets 5 stars from me.]
