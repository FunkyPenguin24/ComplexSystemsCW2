[109957750960026720210,100505486475925117810,Working with Dr. Wahl was a fantastic experience! I highly recommend anyone with back or neck pain/issues to use Dr. Wahl and Chiropractic Care and Sports Rehab. I had lower back pain for 12 years from sports injuries in High School. A small fender bender aggravated the pain to beyond belief. After an initial consultation Dr. Wahl, he put me on a program to address the chronic pain, and then he set up a maintenance program afterwards. This was the best money I ever spent. I am back to normal and my back doesn't have any lingering issues. Considering that it used to hurt just to roll out of bed in the morning I am eternally grateful to Dr. Wahl and his professional and courteous staff. Keep up the great work and thanks for helping me get back to normal!!!!]
