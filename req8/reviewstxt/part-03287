[112058469337503330482,100328966646048063058,Zayna's is the first hookah place I went to outside of someone's house and the atmosphere is great. Ian and John are always helpful whenever you need anything. If you're there and you don't know what to get, all of Ian's recommendations are great. If Ian is busy John is always ready to help so you're never without assistance.]
