[101703842110592581494,101140389658993542262,Stopped in for lunch today. I'm on a diet so I really limited myself on the lunch selections. That was horrible because everything on the menu looked very appetizing. So I decided on the Salmon with Soba Noodles. Awesome!!! The service was excellent, too. I'll be going back soon....]
