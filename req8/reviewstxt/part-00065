[106441845472370039681,100162148249128210632,I had a great experience. My auto broker took care of the price negotiating and when I got there I just had to sign the papers, car was washed and ready. Everything was as discussed. Brent, the finance manager, was awesome. ALSO I asked them if they can hook me up with a free oil change and Vanessa, the sales manager, told me my first oil change would be on them. Definitely would recommend this place!]
