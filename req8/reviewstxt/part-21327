[106917121415879603303,100130533384472502936,This has to be my favourite restaurant in the Chelmsford area. I have now become a regular and tried most things on the menu. The set meal is what I tend to go for....only Â£15.95 for two courses which is absoilutely excellent value in my opinion. I think it is even cheaper at lunchtime but I usually visit in the evening. Today I had braised steak which was melt in the mouth served with creamy mash and I couldn't resist the lemon tart....so good I will eat it again later in the week if they've still got it on the menu.]
