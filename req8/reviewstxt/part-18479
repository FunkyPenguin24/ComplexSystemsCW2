[104509695670033344236,101154881685346261511,Had a great experience with the dealership when purchasing my new 2013 Elantra, awesome vehicle... In fact, my partner loved the car so much he went and bought him one as well! The only thing I have bad to say about the dealership is the Service Department, which in my opinion is very poorly staffed and not reliable at all... The management either needs to be replaced, or train your folks a little better to deal with customer service! What should have taken a little over an hour turned into 5 hours, was not at all pleased. I have seen other bad reviews on the service department which should tell them something? Hope it improves as I do like the dealership and would like to continue to bring our cars in when service is required. Thanks.]
