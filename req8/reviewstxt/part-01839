[102222481279131558949,100254295319402635757,My friend Carol recommended this. I visited Last month (around the middle of November 2013) and loved the service. The restaurant was moderately busy on a week night, and the cold outside was quickly countered with hot tea and friendly service. The food was great. I'm not a big fan of Chinese cookies (they are bland for cleaning the breath and palate), but the Spicy Kung Pao Chicken was great. It was also a large enough serving to enjoy 3 meals. I dined alone so this was a fantastic plus. I also saw one couple sharing an entr√©e. Other couples throughout did presumably the same as I did; taking home extra for lunch or dinner. I was frequently checked on during my short visit, and the staff was quick to accommodate my needs. I appreciate Carol's recommendation and will gladly share it with anyone interested. PLEASE NOTE: This is not your typical Chinese buffet type restaurant. If they do offer a buffet, it is at scheduled times and I am positive the buffet service would be equally satisfying.]
