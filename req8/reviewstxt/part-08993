[108164169294592455270,100637944584735784370,I would not recommend Church Services. I called for air conditioning services and specifically asked if the technician would come out and look to see what the problem was and not just add more Freon to my unit. The lady said this would happen on the phone. The technician came out and did not even bother to look at the inside unit nor the outside unit. He recommended just adding Freon. The issue is I had a leak somewhere but that was another $300 to find out where the leak was. I asked him he was going to bother even looking at either the inside or outside unit. The technician said he could only add Freon. At this point I have a hot house and not many choices. I spent $300 on Freon plus the $80 service call. I wanted to find out where the unit was leaking so I did not have to keep adding Freon. I had another service come out (who I would highly recommend) and the leak was on the outside unit right and very visible. The customer service department from Church Services called and I let them know my frustration with the service. I have never heard back from them. I typically do not write reviews but wanted the buyer to beware.]
