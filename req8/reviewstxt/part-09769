[106984933229601883184,100680267500944987049,The price at Fon Jon is incredibly reasonable (about 42% less for daycare than where I used to take my dog!). When we start to drive down the street my dog gets excited and at the end of the day always leaves happy so I know they are taking great care of him. I would highly recommend Fon Jon's to anyone looking for doggie daycare :)]
