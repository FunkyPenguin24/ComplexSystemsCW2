[113934583598335131538,100729983151882603192,Best Chiro experience I have ever had. Dr Sherrod knows what he is doing. Bulging disc in my neck. This problem has almost brought me to tears several times. 1 single visit to the DR and I was good. He KNOWS WHAT HE IS DOING and is gentle as compared to other old school chiros that just want to yank your neck around!!! I would recommend him to any and all who need help.]
