[102223067789804592614,100769829739815052734,I absolutely love the new Jungle Jim's Eastgate. Our family had been anxiously awaiting their opening and we haven't been disappointed. The selection, from beer to cheeses to the salsa bar, to hot sauces to fresh produce..., is incredible The service has been very good every time we've gone. It has become our primary grocery store which I frequent at least a couple times a week.]
