[100011244261480411740,100124465424922261736,high end italian food, arrived earlier to my reservation time, but had drink in the bar which is packed and a cool place to hangout. dinner was very good (tuna tartare and spaghetti with meatballs), authentic italian, very vast wine list, pricing was expensive, but well worth it. the DJ spinning nice tunes all night. everything was great UNTIL the dessert arrived, I ordered Tiramisu (my favorite) but the one they gave me it appeared to be out of a pre made dessert box from walmart, that was the only negative of my dining experience, otherwise it would have been perfect]
