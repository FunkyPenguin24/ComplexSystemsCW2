[115922551822895041538,100218443264082275257,Went into Capitol Guitars roughly 3 years ago when I was in the Twin Cities taking care of an ill parent. I was just curious about how some different pickups sounded in different guitar woods and they helped me with everything I needed with a great attitude. Once I proved I was a musician I had basically my run of the place. Knowledgeable guys that just wanted to help me out. The only thing I bought their was a tremolo arm, had I had more money I would have went out of their with a lot more. This is how a music/guitar shop should be. Guitar Denter could learn a lot from these smaller privately owned stores. I still have family in the area and will be back the next time I'm in town. Made a great impression on me in one afternoon.]
