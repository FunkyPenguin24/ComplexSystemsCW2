[107577784433676791375,100069940837525285506,In October of 2012, I purchased my very first vehicle. After researching the best possible option for myself and my budget, I landed on a Nissan. I found the staff at Dave's Jackson Nissan to be friendly, accommodating, and very helpful. The salesman I worked with, Andy Nastally, was wonderful in assisting me with my choice without being overly pushy. He helped me through the process and made buying my first car a great experience. I highly recommend this dealership.]
