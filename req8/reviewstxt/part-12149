[108778348340524711382,100808921450376532850,My power went out today when it was around 104 degrees. When I called Haddox and Sons, the owner, Chris, answered and suggested I try a couple things first before telling me he could be here in a couple of hours. Since what he suggested didn't work, I had Chris come out. He had the problem fixed in a very short period of time and gave me an estimate on replacing the whole electrical box since it's so old. I will definitely be calling Haddox and Sons to replace the box and strongly recommend this company to anyone who needs a friendly and professional electrician!]
