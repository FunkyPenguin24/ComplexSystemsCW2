[105948579106373364950,100466727435815256530,I had my catalytic converter stolen right in front of my home. I am really picky with my baby(car). I general stick to one mechanic. Unfortunately, my mechanic does not work on exhaust. He recommended Select Automotive. I was skeptical, I called and the receptionist was so nice.( I later found out that it was a family owned business) That put me to ease right away. I needed my car done the next day. she informed me it could be done. That night I received a call from the owner informing my car was on his premise. I was shocked. Before any work was done to my car I was called and was asked if they should proceed, you never get that anymore. To make a long story short. My car was done by 12 in the afternoon the next day, I paid pennies compared to any other place. The service was awesome. I would definitively recommend anyone to this shop.]
