[101845371129332443398,100031241433046722718,This store is just great! Iâ€™ve been to Germany 2 years ago and this shop saved my life. Staff there is very nice and helpful. They have a lot of very interesting things to see and buy. The owner speaks English very well. Had a great time in Germany and this shop part of it. They order stuff on request too so anything you need, you'll get it! And hey! Dont forget to ask the owner there if you can throw and kick some beer crates around! :P He just might let you!]
