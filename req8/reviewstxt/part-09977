[107251508495370432487,100692312324592020361,I visited Sheehy Nissan of Glen Burnie, along with a few other car dealerships in the area, a few weeks ago. On this particular day I was only there to explore my options and was not ready to buy. When I returned this week, I was pleasantly surprised that my salesman, Kenny Pursley, not only remembered me, but remembered the vehicle that I was interested in, and most importantly what I needed and why. I was very impressed since I didn't leave my name or phone number on my initial visit. Not only did he listen to my needs, he was also very knowledgeable about the vehicle and extremely welcoming to me and my family. I felt very comfortable talking with him and never felt that I was being pressured to make a purchase. Kenny takes the time to get to know his customers and their needs, in my opinion, that is the basis for excellent customer service. I would highly recommend Kenny to my friends and family.]
