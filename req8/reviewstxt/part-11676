[104608150512167658416,100784211661418537006,During the Utah 2013 Pride Festival ; my party and I of about 7 other social gatherings were approached by security about no glass, or no alcohol, on the premises. It wouldn't have been bad if they stated this rule out for the additional 7 other socials there. We were all there to have and enjoy ourselves. That family of 9 looked pretty suspicious, way to many smaller kids for two parents to watch. (way to single out our LGBT group out of all of them) recordings posted to my blog.]
