[100792874616663118393,100603633145809910524,Do yourself a favor and do NOT shop here. To be fair, we found some nice desks (we shopped for a computer desk) for a pretty fair price. Nelle, the owner, seemed to be happy to help at start but quickly got distracted. He tried to push more products and suggest a special drawer stand for the desk for us for an outrageous price. Since we had no time, we agreed to it at the end. Drawers cost us more than $100, where I could get something similar in Staples for probably as little as $40. And then things started getting worse. Nelle promised us a delivery date he could not back up. We ended up waiting for more than two weeks for an order that was supposed to show up after a week. He did not contact us, did not leave messages, he basically did nothing to inform us that there's a delay, we had to call and find out on our own. The was a delay twice. In order to sweeten the deal, Nelle said the desk will be assembled for us. That never happened. The desk came in three different parts, still wrapped up. If someone tried to put it up, they did not finish the job. The guy who delivered the desk was in a hurry, mumbled something, and left the table as is. The furniture seem to be in overall okay shape, but I could have just showed up and take it on my own, for the price they charged us for the delivery (the table is not put up together anyway). The owner also confuses his customers and doesn't seem to know who he's talking to. I gave him identifying information, but he cut me off and told me he left a message, when in fact, it wasn't me he was thinking about. After some back and forth he gave me a quick "yesyesyes" and assured me the table is on it's way. Good thing I called to find out. In short: They have okay things, some of which are for normal prices (do not get drawers and chairs there!!), but they know nothing about customer service and responsibility.]
