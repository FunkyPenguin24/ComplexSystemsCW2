[100744065282542240401,100520392832299364292,This hotel was recently purchased and is under new ownership. The lobby has been remodeled and is really nice. (I hear the previous owners had a fire.) The rooms are clean, the sheets are new, towels are fluffy (best I've had at a hotel) and the shower had lots of pressure. We had an opportunity to speak with the owner (between phone calls with various contractors) and he shared his plans for total remodel. If you need a place to stay in Needles, this is your best bet.]
