[109483149080556310613,100144153056691053287,Hello Today's Mobile! Remember me?! I hope you do because I hope you you see this! It's the girl whose phone you screwed up! So this is the first time ever that I am writing a review and congrats to you guys! you got my virginity on posting a review! Aren't you guys glad you guys suck. First of all the quality of fixing my phone was fantastic which was I had to agree was a good appeal in quality since the first guy who helped me did everything perfectly in fixing my crappy tmobile phone's screen which I only fixed to get my contacts and important files (Thank you for that)---Its after that is when my series of events went down hill and worse. I asked if they also did contact phone transfers to my new phone which was why I got my old fixed in the first place. The new guys seemed hesitant to do it which, I should have trusted my instinct in my first place and gone to Metro (my new phone company to transfer my files) and what happened? They lost ALL my contacts that I had back from when I 18 yrs old! (I'm 24 now) Though they tried to fix the solution my contacts were gone. I tried to ask if there was any other solution to getting it fixed and said I was upset that this happened. I guess the fat balding middle-eastern dude tried to explain it was not their fault?! When I had and checked that my contacts where in there? AND he never once apologized and started yelling at me making me more flustered! Thanks a bunches easing my worries and not helping me find a solution and yelling at a girl! I just want to say thanks to original guy that fixed my phone and F*** you to the fat balding middle eastern dude and I will be spreading bad inputs about you particularly. Hope you guys enjoyed my review!]
