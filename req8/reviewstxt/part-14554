[106418283455149180169,100943097115597891355,I started taking my Apollo out to DogTown after having a TERRIBLE experience with another boarding/daycare facility out on Winchester Rd. The staff at DogTown are all great with the dogs and I have to fight Apollo to keep him from dragging me up the stairs to get into the building every time I drop him off! I always recommend to all of my friends that they take their dogs to DogTown when they have to go out of town.]
