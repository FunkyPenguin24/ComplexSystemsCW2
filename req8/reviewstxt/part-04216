[106151713422014902987,100382955823211881227,When we first moved to Atlanta, we went to a dentist in East Cobb that a friend had recommended. He told my husband and I that we both needed all our fillings replaced and gum grafting, costing thousands of dollars. Being skeptical, we went for a second opinion to Dr Nagode, who another friend had recommended. After examining us, he told us we didn't need any of the things the other dentist told us, and we have been going to Dr Nagode ever since. Dr Nagode is the best, most honest, and kind dentist in Atlanta and we would never go anywhere else. Our family of five has received excellent dental care from his practice. How many people can say their children like going to the dentist? Ours do! His office staff is so friendly and helpful that they feel like family. If you are looking for a dentist you can trust, I would definitely recommend Dr. Nagode. We drive from East Cobb to Sandy Springs to see him, and it's worth the drive.]
