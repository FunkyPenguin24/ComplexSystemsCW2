As a purple belt, I can say that the advanced curriculum is top-notch and taught by excellent instructors. The fundamentals curriculum is solid as well, with an emphasis on details that'll help build tough grapplers. Here, you can also round out your game with excellent striking instruction or improve your cardio with fitness classes. Plus it's the cleanest, best-looking gym I've ever been to. It really is a great place to train for men, women and children. Great vibe. Check it out.]
