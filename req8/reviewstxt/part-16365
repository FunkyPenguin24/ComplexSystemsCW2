[101227398390190441348,101040281260619297976,Incredibly shady mortgage company. My mortgage was sent over here by Bank of America and it's been 2 months of failure. They are 0 for 2. I was double charged my mortgage on the first month, overdrew my account. So I should be good for next month right? Two payments for the first month, so I'm good right? Nope, got charged again. So that's 3 payments in 2 months. I sent multiple emails, don't expect them to reply. These emails are being sent to some sort of void where people aren't seeing them. So when I called them, they admitted to the double payment but do they take care of it? Nope. I have to send in all this paperwork from my bank for some crap reason. It's obviously a ploy to get people to not reverse the payment. I'm immediately looking at other lenders. This one sucks.]
