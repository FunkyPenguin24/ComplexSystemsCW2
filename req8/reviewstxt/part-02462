[103868001219737108574,100285817446010622198,I went to Texas Road House wanting to like it. Some of my extended family went just after it opened and were not impresses. My wife and I just went there on a date. I will say that the service was great. We were seated fast and served well. However the food was terrible. I ordered a Berger with fries and had a onion flower as an entree. This is one of my favorites to get at other restaurants in the chain. Everything was so salty that I couldn't handle more than a couple of bites. On top of that they burnt my Berger. The mistakes were managed well and they let me order some pulled pork instead. That was better but still nothing to write home about. My walk away conclusion is that until they find better chefs I will not waste my time and money by eating there in the near future. I might try it again in a year or if I hear from people that I trust that they have improved their food.]
