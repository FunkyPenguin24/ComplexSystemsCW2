[117474076465074300548,100736788126320916823,I placed an order for pickup, my estimated time for pickup was 7:23pm. When I arrived at 7:26pm after paying for my order they informed me my pizza was ready but that they had forgotten to prepare the breadsticks I ordered and I would have to wait. Normally I am a patient person and would have waited the 5-10 minutes for my breadstick however this is not the first time I have had a problem at this specific location. (5825 W Bell Rd) About two months ago we visited this location to grab some quick dinner after some shopping at the Walmart in the same parking lot, we order and were told it would take 15 minutes for our pizza to be ready for carryout. After waiting almost 45 minutes we finally received our pizza, we decided at the point we would just eat there and went and sat at a table to eat. About 2 minutes in a employee male I believe his name is Jonathan came over grabbed a chair from a nearby table proceed to turn it around and sit in the chair backwards to talk to us. Very rudely he told us we were not welcome to eat our dinner there since we ordered carryout not dine in and the prices are different. He even accused of doing this on purpose to get a better deal, which was not the case at all. I am normally not one to complain being a Manager in the service industry I understand ever situation is perceived differently by each costumer. However after two unsatisfied visits to the same location I felt something needs to be said about the location and the service or lack there of. I was never once apologized to this evening for my order being incomplete. I had them refund me and took my business elsewhere. I order from Pizza Hut a lot not just for personal but business as well and have never had issue like I have with this location.]
