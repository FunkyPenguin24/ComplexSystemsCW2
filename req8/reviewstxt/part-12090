[115456331080441105677,100806188190363944049,I was a long time patient of Dr. Chen's but after a change in insurance I decided to go with a "Plan Dentist" to save money. So started a series of discouraging and disappointing visits with other dentists in the area. Not only were their facilities not as clean and modern as Dr. Chen's, but I ended PAYING MORE than I did with Dr. Chen. I also did not have the trust in these other dentists that Dr. Chen had earned with me. So I am no HAPPILY back with Dr. Chen and his incredible staff!]
