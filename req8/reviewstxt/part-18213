[107636404997270340568,101141257917422184964,Sams is one of my favorite low key bars to go to around town. The food is great, beer is cheap and the servers are on top of it! You get away from the downtown hype, but can still enjoy karaoke on Friday nights, happy hour specials and good company. It's definitely one of my favorite places around town. And it's non-smoking now :) I highliy reccomend the chicken ceasar wrap, trivia outings on Wednesday night and two for one specials on Tuesdays!]
