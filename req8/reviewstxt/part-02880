[103125530336557146281,100307687531890952898,Hmm... I totally understand the other poster's sentiment regarding ridiculous charges (I know from experience that you are best off ordering from their website; corporate is a whole different beast than retail, and MUCH more consumer friendly/helpful). However, I called in to the store regarding an update issue that has been plaguing my poor phone in regards to the Android 4.3 update, and the person I talked to actually had useful ideas. By contrast, the Fullerton store has the most useless staff I've ever encountered - NEVER go there. Anyway, he explained that there is really nothing to do besides a diagnostic (because it's most likely just an OS/Sprint system issue), but explained a workaround that I could easily do myself involving a factory reset to my device. Good info that I will probably try if my system update continues to fail; minus a star because he didn't tell me his name and his greeting was extremely abrupt.]
