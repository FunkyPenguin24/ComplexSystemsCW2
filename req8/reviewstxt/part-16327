[117044132628737956476,101037830665998781300,I've been looking for some nice rims for my Honda Accord the past two weeks. My friend told me about this place Car Tunes and sure enough they had exactly what I was looking for. I checked prices at some other local places and they ended up having the cheapest price. I went ahead and ordered them and while I was there I got my windows tinted. They use Viper brand tint, not that cheap purple looking crap you get from Wal-mart, and I have to say I love they way it looks. They even covered the dot matrix on the rear window with vinyl to make the tint look seamless for a little extra. It was definitely worth it. Also while they were finishing up the tint job I talked to the other guy there about coming back to get a complete sound system ( head unit and speakers) after I got the rims taken care of. The quoted price ended up being cheaper then the total my roommate had spent at advance custom audio about three months ago. I would highly recommend Car Tunes to anyone in the Morgantown area that wants quality work with superb customer service.]
