[112283916935570327974,100204742304568493090,I hope this review saves someone else time, money and frustration. Where do I begin, I guess getting stood up twice and not getting any of my phone calls return was the worst. Seem like a nice guy, but while cleaning the carpet some kind of powder residue made 2 big, noticeable stains. This was a house i moved out of so I didn't find out about the stains for a week. I would expect a professional to have called me to inform me what happened while he was cleaning. Let me say the stain is not hes fault, but he should have called to inform me. After i called him to ask about the stain he had nothing to say but to offer to come back out and see if he can get it out, and only charge for his gas and chemicals used. We set up a appointment and he was a now show. Called him several times with no answer, left voice mail he never contacted me back. 4 days later feed up with him not calling me back I decide to call from my work phone, i was surprised when he answer. When I told him my address he remembered who I was we setup another appointment. And once again he stood me up. Save your money, time, and frustration call someone else.]
