[101335723844330925426,100791101711563987428,The transmission went out in my 97 4runner so I brought her in for them to look at. They took the time to drive the vehicle and give her a free inspection. I left her in their hands and they did not disappoint This Aamco went out of their way to get me what I needed and was able to work with me financially. The Truck has never run better and I am 100% satisfied with the care they showed to me and my vehicle. I will say the only drawback is the sites location does offer limited parking but other than that they will take care of you. Theyâ€™re good people!!!]
