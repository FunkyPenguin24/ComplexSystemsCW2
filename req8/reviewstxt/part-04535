[105548688513648037219,100400660950118272682,My daughter was driving home from college when our car broke down. She brought it into Mr. Tire for repair, They did a computer scan for a cost of $116 and recommended services that needed to be done. It was expensive but what choice did we have, my daughter needed to get home. We asked that they return all the parts they removed from our car so that we could show it to our mechanic at home in New Jersey. Our mechanic showed us that Mr. Tire did not change our plugs which were listed on our bill. In fact, the plugs that he claimed were removed from our car and changed would not even fit our car. Our original plugs were still in our vehicle, verified by the serial numbers. We called and asked for a partial refund for work not completed and he told us to bring the car back to him. We live 3 hours away and we certainly did not want to break down again. Nice job to take advantage of a student from out of state. That isn't how I would choose to make my living!!!]
