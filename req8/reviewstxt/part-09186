[106012862485264423879,100648790518131118947,Just got done with my first appointment with my new dentist Scott Grant, DMD. I've been to a lot of dentists and this by far is the best one I've been to! Right as I walked in the door they were friendly and actually giving away a BBQ to a patient for referring more patients, and they treat you like family there, making sure your as anxiety free and comfortable as possible. There up to date in technology too, they can make a porcelain crown right there in the office. If you need a dentist or just want a better one give them a call and let them know Cory Maas referred you (so I can potentially get a macbook air). Oh ya, if you refer 4 people they just give you an iPad mini...who does that!?!?!?!?!]
