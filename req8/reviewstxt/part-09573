[103569033536856630208,100670239851293974065,HP/COMPAQ has very rude and unhelpful technical support. I tried twice and spent more than two hours on the phone with tech suppport, tryingt to find drivers after a reformat. They kept insisting that I buy a driver cd when the drivers are online!!! The site was just very difficult to use and I wanted a list of required drivers. Stupid. Eventually, I found what I needed . . . just using try and failure. See, I am online!! It would be great if the tech support guy was willing to help instead of insisting I buy something I didn't need. I very thoroughly regret spending money on their worthless warranty.]
