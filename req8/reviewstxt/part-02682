[105749465752432148578,100296864364643181077,I worked with Alfred Martus in purchasing my 2013 4Runner SR5. Not only was he friendly and courteous but, he was very knowledgeable in the products he sells. He went as far as taking me on 2 separate test drives, showed me his own vehicle for comparison, and worked with me to get a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend Alfred and Charles Maund Toyota to anyone interested in purchasing a Toyota.]
