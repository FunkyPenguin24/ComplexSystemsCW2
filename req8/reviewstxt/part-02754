[105365063783004577187,100301042384744142063,Gear Peddler rips off my 12-year-old son. My son recently bought a used bike from Gear Peddler in Bend and it fell apart within two weeks. Before we made the purchase we asked if the bike had been gone through and they stated the bike had been checked. We also asked “What if there is a problem after we purchase the bike?” and they responded that they would “take care of us.” When we brought the bike back because the crank was falling off (we already had to replace the handle grips) they refused to take the bike back and their idea of “taking care of us” was to pay them to fix it. I explained to them my son bought the bike with his own money and the manager was unapologetic and made comments like “what if you bought the bike on Craigslist?” I told him I was going to give him a bad review online and he said “he didn’t really care, it happens all of the time…. we have plenty of customers.” Absolutely no care about customer service. Avoid this place like the plague; I am sure there are other small companies in Bend that will give you the service you deserve. Obviously Craigslist is a better bet! Unfortunately my son got a lesson of “let the buyer beware.”]
