[111037433730083273060,100142444059505001971,Horrible customer service. Ran into financial issues, all my neighbors are receiving services at a lesser rate. Rep said she could give me a better rate once my contract was up...REALLY DUH. Of course you are going to give me a better rate when my contract is up to try and keep me...that's a given. Wouldn't do anything to help me now. I would not recommend this service provider at all. I am telling EVERYONE I know. Social media is a great thing! Don't use or sign their three year contract!]
