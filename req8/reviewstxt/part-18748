[115106831336156677966,101170123618725089608,I went there with my girlfriend to celebrate our one year anniversary. I look at the menu and I was in shock over the prices but if she was happy, was worth it. however when we receive our food it looked bad and tasted it terrible. My girlfriend did not eat the fish and she is bringing it home to her dog. I have to work in the sun 1 1/2 days for this meal. I want to forget it and I will never go back. I am also going to share the story with everybody. :(]
