[106501242048285269262,100489380374961973847,We decided to move our closing to a few days earlier, and they were able to accommodate us last-minute. Because they were so busy, we had to wait ~20 minutes for our appointment. They did a good job of explaining all of the many documents we had to sign. They had forgot to have us sign one of the documents, so they emailed that document to use, we signed it, scanned it, and emailed it back to them; that was a bit inconvenient. That same day we were able to get our keys, and they gave us a hard copy of everything we had signed and our HOA documents. They had a small children's room for our 4-year-old to play in while we waited to begin, so that made it bearable. They also had many snacks/treats/beverages that we could help ourselves to while we waited (the 4-year-old also enjoyed that). This is the only house I've bought, but I thought it was relatively painless.]
