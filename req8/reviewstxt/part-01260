[109983003155611068999,100224035407883620248,I bought my SnugTop from Darren and the boys at AA Topper some 7 years ago and thought it was time to dish out a few kudos! 1st of all I have never had any issues with my SnugTop and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality topper. I've also purchased Fender Flares and a Grill Guard from these guys and the installation work on everything has proven to be flawless and reliable over the 7 year life of my truck. If quality products and service on your truck cap and other accessories is what you're looking for, you'll get it here.... and Darren will remember you regardless of how long it is between visits:)]
