[110930016838149857968,100223879474437702916,The best service, the most professional people all in one happy place!!! I highly recommend this dental office. I had a great experience from setting up the appointment and filling out forms before hand, to walking in the dental office being greeted so friendly by the staff to the highly experienced dental assistants to Dr. Redd who is so good at what he does!! He is very friendly, very professional and great at talking through each step of the way. He is detail oriented and makes sure you are ok and well numbed. Lol I had my old fillings replaced with porcelain and had my wisdom teeth pulled. This is a high tech dental office w/ up to date equipment. Why go anywhere else?]
