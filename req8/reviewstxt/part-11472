[101245497655159770265,100771937066878557323,Since 2002, several members of my family and I had been admitted into this hospital more than once under different departments due to various surgeries. My mother had been under the able care of the Late Dr Sanjeev Dhawan for over 12 years. Barring a few small incidents, our stay in this hospital had been mostly satisfactory. Even today, several members of my family are under the care of its various doctors. I wish SGRH a bright future!]
