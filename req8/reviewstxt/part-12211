[110981029417940301632,100812565364648216164,Me and my family have been going here for years, and LOVE It! If you dont want to spend a fortune to see some the the newest family films out then this is the place for you. The popcorn is still being popped fresh and smothered with REAL butter and is very affordable. We usually get there early, and bring a pizza from a local shop... and let the kids play with a ball or some fun outdoor sport till movie time. Gotta get there early to get one of the good spots! This is meant to be a family place so there are kids but that's what makes this cool... no 100% quiet and boring like the movie theater and since you control the volume you can turn it up or down depending on your own needs. Going there again tonight for the 1st time this season and look forward to several more. Go and enjoy!]
