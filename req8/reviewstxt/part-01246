[110124364456376566862,100223521783532597471,I was always worried about where to get a haircut in Las Vegas before I found NY Hair. I have curly hair that can be very hard to cut with style. Now I always go here to see Nikki. She's amazing with different styles and is also extremely friendly and willing to work with you to develop your look. My haircuts have been getting better and better the more I go. This place is always busy because everyone comes back. So check it out it's the best place I've ever been to and I've tried many of the high end businesses in town. They are all really cool, talented, and know what looks good - especially Nikki.]
