[108812061961849535340,100104507236630219697,My daughter bought a ticket for Logan Airport and was told it was $45. She expressed surprise but paid in cash and later saw that the one-way ticket was only $25. She phoned us, we went back 10 minutes later with a pdf of the ticket and the woman who sold her the ticket said first that it was the cost of a round trip ticket, then when we showed her the pdf denied that she would have sold her a one-way ticket for $45. Nothing to be done. $20 not returned. Buyer beware. The prices are not posted anywhere--look it up ahead of time. An unscrupulous teller can easily pocket some extra cash this way.]
