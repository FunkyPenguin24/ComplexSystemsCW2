[102938214279518998423,100867726333188420967,Dr. Eduard Burt is a very competent chiropractor. He has done excellent work on my back. I had an injury on November 2nd, which for me, at least, was fairly extreme and dealt a blow to my back, causing a misalignment, one inch on the top and one inch on the bottom. He carefully assists in its realignment. I am glad for this.]
