[114972420239570681105,100236007952382824473,Agree with Abby Doodle... Briar Grove is worthy of your support. It's a survivor amidst the Walgreen & CVS sweep, and for good reason. To wit: After a recent major back surgery, my doc recommended a pain medication, for post-op pain, that would allow me to return to work quickly. I could NOT find this med anywhere in metro Houston (12 phone calls, spent 1/2 day chasing it down) w/o a 1 week order delay. Briar Grove had it in stock. The staff were also very courteous in the way they handled the "checking" they had to do in order to dispense this scrip. And, were quick to offer some customer insights into the various side effects I might expect. The store has an interesting mix of diverse inventory as well... see Abby Doodle's review. Good people, great inventory management... worthy of your business!]
