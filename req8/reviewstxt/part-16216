[117463393723683848628,101032715864565742770,This church is has been instrumental in my Christian walk. The campus pastors really present biblical truth in a life relevant way. I'm at a point in my life where serving has given me a totally new perspective on what Jesus meant when he commanded us to love one another. Wherever your at in your spiritual journey, I encourage you to give 2|42 a test drive and see if your experience prompts you to take your next step. If you're led to check us out, be sure and enjoy a hot cup of Zingerman's coffee and look me up. I'd love to meet you. Michael Elenio]
