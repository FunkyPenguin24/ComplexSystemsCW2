[110293924857079583359,100032618634574696977,Having just returned from a fab day out to probably the best Zoo I have visited, I feel compelled to comment, not something I usually do! However, overall very clean and well managed, themes are fantastic and above all (and most important) the animals are very well looked after yet accessible and visible (my 4 yr old daughter had loads to see). Only two things to feedback on.. Firstly the aviaries (Parrots) area is unkempt and overgrown, I appreciate its important to get as close to natural environment but you can't actually see anything for over/under growth, secondly the poor old lonely elephant should go into retirement now, at 43 she looks like she needs a rest from public view. Money well spent..]
