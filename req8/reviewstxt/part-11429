[114456307662515872083,100770270901793159533,Open arrangement, delicious food, friendly staff & a wide variety of food. Ocean's bar & grill had really great food & great prices. Their beer is tasty & the feel of it make's you never want to leave. What I really loved is that I ordered a banana dessert & the waiter actually ran next door to grab some, fresh off the tree. If you're looking for a place to sit back, watch some sports, drink beer & eat nachos, then Ocean's is where it's at.]
