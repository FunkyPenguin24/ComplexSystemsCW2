[100166147472937442567,100445679280908487111,They are still going through going through some growing pains, but they are solid other than a few hiccups. I had the mushroom truffle burger which was as flavorful and mouthwatering and the smash fries...oh the rosemary garlicy goodness! Dip both the fries and shroom-truff burg in the smashsauce for a B'OMG flavor'splosion! This is my third time at this location and the cashier seemed confused with the order process, yet again, but recovered and per the usual the busers I interacted with were nice and genuinely seemed to happy to be there, which makes my restaurant experience enjoyable. I will continue coming back as the meat is always fresh tasting and I cannot get enough of the fries!]
