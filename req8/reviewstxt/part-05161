[103525192666303845573,100432203726405252728,Just at Clark's tonight for Happy Hour. We went there because they are on the water with a beautiful view. We were told by our hostess that we could not have the 1/2 price appetizers outside on the patio or anywhere else for that matter except the bar area. Matt, our wonderful server, reinforced this stupid rule. Love the atmosphere but will not be returning for Happy Hour!]
