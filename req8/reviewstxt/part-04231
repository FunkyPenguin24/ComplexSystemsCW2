[114574585868805412189,100383400833131280643,Terrible service; terrible, over-priced food. Got a combo plate which included coffee/tea but there was no coffee or tea served with the meal; asked for mild spiciness and got a fiery, mouth-burning concoction. Server did not speak to us once during the meal except to ask for our order.]
