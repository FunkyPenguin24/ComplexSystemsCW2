[104130198325654537658,100322739603781784146,Excellent food and service with classic personal style from classically uniformed crew of waiters, who bring your food to a separate serving table for final preparation. Quite expensive at ~70 CHF for dinner not including wine, but perhaps worth it considering the attention you get. I recall the waiter had to set an extra place for me and he precisely arranged each implement "just so" with a small smile. My osso bucco with pomme fritte was perfect. The green salad at 14 CHF is overpriced, with a dressing that I found too sour and salty. Everything else was good. Like all restaurants in Zurich, it is a bit loud when full.]
