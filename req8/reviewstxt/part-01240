[107254016305238640938,100223203908033888307,I got my new car from Steve Rayman and after just 16,000 miles the tires got worn out. The tires were of KUMHO company and were of pathetic quality. After driving around 10K miles the tires were worn out and my friends pointed the same out to me but I did not believe them thinking that I just bought a brand new vehicle and how can the tires get worn out. Later when I realized, I complained to Steve Rayman dealership and to my surprise was told that the tires do not have warranty. I have been really a disappointed customer with this experience and in future do not see myself buying a GM or chevy vehicle any more. I had to pay in order to get all the 4 tires replaced for my new vehicle. I have put a complain to KUMHO tires as well. I would not recommend Steve Rayman to anyone for buying a vehicle.]
