[117632404468153121753,100605667030499799606,When I walked into Goodwill in Fridley I was greeted by happy employees! I walk into other store and no one seems to like their jobs. This Goodwill was like a breath of fresh air. Their clothes were name brand and in very good condition. I now shop there every Tuesday for their 1.49 color tag sale. I am proud to say ....my closet is now filled with beautiful name brand clothes in excellent condition! ...and I still have money in my pockets!!!!! Thank you Goodwill in Fridley!!!!!!]
