[100061644811223050252,100869544735299303750,This is my first negative review ever as I dont think anyone should be judged based on a single experience. It's also important to note that this review isn't about the chararcter of the people at Bemer Motor Cars (as they all seemed nice enough). However it is intended to warn people of the lack of professionalism and the potential damage that a "repair" from Bemer can cause. I brought my Range Rover to them as they were open on a weekend and the amber engine light had come on. The owner was quite nice and helpful. There is a long list of issues after this, incomplete repair, almost zero communicaiton, delays upon pcikup (which I had to do repeatedly) and finally a repair that created a worse engine problem than I started with. I literally had to take this vehickle bucking, lurching and leaking to the Range Rover dealer. The Land Rover dealer called me in to review the the mistakes that had been made so they explain why I was goiong ot have to pay a 2nd time for the exact same "repair" Bemer had completed just days earlier. I brought this to the attention of Bemer Motorcars believing they would do the right thing but I have not heard anything as of yet.]
