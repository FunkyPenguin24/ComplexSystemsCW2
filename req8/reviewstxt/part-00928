[103267209258942703955,100207377733388882272,I've had the opportunity to take two classes through Ride Chicago. I initially took the scooter class with Jenya a few years ago and had a really positive experience. It made me a more confident and composed rider, better able to face the mean streets of Chicago. When I began to think about upgrading to a bigger ride, I knew that Ride Chicago would take good care of me! I took the Basic Licensing class even though I had my license already, mostly to learn the ins and outs of operating a manual bike. Although I happened to choose two of the hottest days of the year (pushing 100 degrees!!!) Eric, Tim, and Brad were all friendly, enthusiastic, knowledgable, and completely unfazed by the searing heat. The instructors made the class incredibly fun; goofy conversation topics were plentiful and kept us laughing throughout the entirety of the class. I really had a great time and now feel ready to tackle the next challenge of riding. Having had the experience of taking both classes, however, I'd recommend that people thinking of taking the scooter consider the Basic Licensing class as many of the skills are transferrable and if you can ride a motorcycle, you can most certainly ride a scooter! Also, you get to spend an extra day with the hilarious instructors! Definitely worth it!]
