[111210312672273301113,100382254095554406025,Overall we were pleased with our visit to Luccas last night. We started with their higher end, $32, Robert Mondavi Cabernet (meh), followed by the garlic parmesan wings, which were crispy and tasty. For our pizza, we tried the Margherita and the BBQ Chicken. Both were very good. Service was somewhat slow, but the place was hopping, so no worries, and the waiter was very responsive. The atmosphere is fine and everybody was friendly. My only advice would be to bring your own wine and pay the $10 corkage fee, rather than drink what they stock. We'll be back!]
