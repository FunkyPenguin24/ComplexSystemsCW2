[105010221882003435891,100247713464316294157,Joe Corsmeier is one of the finest attorneys I have had the pleasure of working with. I first contacted Joe in an abundance of caution to ensure we were complying with the Florida Bar rules pertaining to how we set up our law firm and client trust account. Joe was always prompt, friendly and easy to work with. Further, I have consulted with joe on many occasions since and each time it has been a pleasure. His staff has always been first rate as well. If you should ever require ethics advice or legal guidance concerning issues with the Florida Bar or the Board of Medicine, this is the lawyer you want on your side. I have personally avoided ever having issues with the Bar by seeking Joe's guidance from the outset. I strongly recommend this attorney without any hesitation.]
