[115902518734336603015,101054759376427984819,Has been my family's home church since 2005. This church has so much going on for the Kingdom of God that it may be too much for the first time visitor to comprehend it all. Once plugged in, one finds more than friendly people, but loving congregants that are dedicated to following the Lord Jesus in every area. King Jesus reigns here. My walk with God has grown and been strengthened by the teaching, preaching, and serving at this church.]
