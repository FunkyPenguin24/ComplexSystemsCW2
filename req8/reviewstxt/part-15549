[101351420076470548241,100997020531413427261,these places are VERY old. They do not keep up on maintenance and during the summer you get ants. Also, for some reason we had little black nats in the kitchen. it was gross! and of course the main office did nothing to help. They are sooo lazy, they move as if they were dead. Also, you have to pay for a laundry card $5.00 and they tell you that they will give you your money back when you move out, but they don't tell you that you have to call the # on the back of the card and try to get your money back from the company they contact the machines through. Neighbors are loud and the complex NEVER has doggie bags for people to pick up their dogs poop. Best thing we did was move out.]
