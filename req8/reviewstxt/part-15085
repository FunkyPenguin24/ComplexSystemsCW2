[103506570113354263211,100971103212402393529,I had never heard of Rice & Beans, but the name of the restaurant leaves no mystery to what they offer. A friend of mine suggested the place, he spoke so highly of the place, what I initially assumed was embellishment I would later discover was genuine candor. Upon entering Rice & Beans, we were not only greeted with a warm smile from all the employees in proximity but also by the aroma of authentic Latin food, at least affordable Latin food on a college budget. I ordered the lunch special, for about 6$, I got a generous helping of mixed rice and beans (from a choice of three types), a few fried plantains that were perfectly sweet and savory with a soft inside and a slight crisp on the outside, stewed beef with potatoes, and a side of black beans. They also had grilled chicken, pork stew, and chicken stew. My friends got the grill chicken and all of our meat selections were cooked exceptionally well, one of my friend picked up his drum stick and before he could go in for the bite a big chunk of chicken swan dived back in the bowl, and the beef pieces in my stew would shred apart each time I pricked one with my fork, needless to say our meats were very tender. At the end of our meal an employee cleared our table for us and offered us coffee, we declined but it was a nice gesture. We came with appetites and left with full stomachs, and instagram pics.]
