[106062024425055738869,100617376421207903481,Received a voucher as a birthday present, just after my new puppy Blink came into my life, and was so pleased to see it was for Brighton Dog Photography. Had some amazing shots of my German Shepherds and Collie previously and was really looking forward to seeing how Rhian would capture Blink. Again was over the moon with the shoot, so much time and effort taken to ensure we had some great shots, and preserved some of the puppy memories i have with Blink. AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING]
