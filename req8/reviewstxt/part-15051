[101012285377525210105,100969512062899214735,I found this place walking by and decided to give it a try. I needed a part replaced which had to be picked up from a dealership, brakes changed, inspection, oil change, and my front plate mounted. Not only did Chris tell me how much everything cost before he did anything and how much labor it would take, but he kept to those numbers which were quite reasonable. I thought my car would be in for a week, but he had it ready for me the very next day. Outstanding.]
