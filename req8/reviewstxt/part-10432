[100696576390425627936,100717098647209180785,What an awesome campground! We camped 3 nights in a tent in the Osprey Loop. Campsite 20 is amazing! Large campsite with a short walk to the bathrooms and showers that are very clean and have nice hot showers that are free. You can walk down the short trail to the lake, which of course provides a beautiful backdrop for the campsite. Everything about the park was very well kept up. Very impressed with the price and amenities.]
