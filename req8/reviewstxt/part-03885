[107104250415395286916,100362711861498410396,I was looking online for just the right car I wanted. After about 5 minutes, I had the vehicle found exactly at Van Hyundai. I requested information and by the next morning I had an email and a phone call from the business. I set up an appointment to look at the vehicle and was greeted by an excellent sales staff. I told him why I wanted the car I wanted and he showed me another option based on my criteria to compare the two. I still chose my original pick though...But I enjoyed that fact that I was offered choices and could make a more educated decision. The staff worked fast to get my SUV ready and made the necessary detail appointments, first oil change appointment, showed me step by step how to use the technology of the vehicle and did it again when I wasn't so sure. I was introduced to the maintaince and parts department, then the office ladies, and anyone else that was there. Made me feel like I was the only reason they were there. I received weekly follow up calls just to be sure everything was okay with vehicle. It wasn't a "now it's yours, leave us alone" attitude... I would greatly recommend this dealership and also my sales person, Anthony Sollis, to the anyone wanting a great car purchasing experience.]
