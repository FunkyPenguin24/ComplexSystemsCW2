[108455315372572539742,100837620617313885820,The new Tesco Watford store blows every other UK supermarket out of the water! Sainsburys, Morrisons, Asda, Lidl etc etc - they all look like backstreet dumps imo compared to the newlook Tesco Extra. The US has been an expensive detour, but I suspect that Tesco has learnt a thing or two from our American cousins. Not such a disaster after all, perhaps.]
