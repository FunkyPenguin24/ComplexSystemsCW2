[104828660745347891074,100201202001673326011,The staff at Neff Physical Therapy is very personable and caring. They take a strong interest in each patient to help them get better. Dr. Neff helped me get rid of my back pain in which the cause was unknown to doctors and all testing. I got very frustrated because my pain wasn't getting better but Dr. Neff never gave up and was persistent when other doctors were not. My dad needed PT for his back and I recommended Dr. Neff without hesitation. Neff Physical Therapy is right in Quarryville so it is convenient for the community but their care is worth any distance. Above all the staff and office is small so they give you one-on-one quality care, which cannot be said at larger organizations.]
