[116231149882387491597,100105872345679345385,Carson at the Studio is so amazing! I go in with a photo, and she cuts it to what I want, and what looks good with my face. I always walk out feeling beautiful, and confident. She also is very good about saying that if I'm unsure about the hair cut later that I can always call her, and get pointers on how to style it. I will always keep going to her, even when she moves to the new location!]
