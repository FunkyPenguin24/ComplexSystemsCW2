[107293615518557166247,101024452578396232029,Once again! You guys are awesome! Late night delivery here on graveyard shift was right on time. Being from Texas, I've ate some damn good wings in my day... And to say that Big Daddy didn't contend is a mere lie. Some of the best damn wings I've had in a LONG time. (Hot Wings), Pizza and all was hot as hades when it got here. You guys rock. Keep up the great work!]
