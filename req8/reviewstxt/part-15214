If you're looking for friendly service and great breakfast, look no further than Country Foodly. Whenever I have guests from out of town, I take them here for breakfast and they've all raved about the food. Their omelettes are terrific and hash browns put Waffle House to shame. Also, ask them about their intricate system for cooking bacon. The bacon slices always come out crisp w/o a lot of grease. See you there!]
