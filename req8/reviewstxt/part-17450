[112908450565363048472,101100585470207059369,I've been going there for the past couple years since it opened. Maybe it's that they share my enthusiasm for classic gaming or maybe it's that they're a small and close-knit business, but either way the customer service and selection of games is nothing short of phenomenal. Not only do they sell games for nearly every video game system ever made (at least as far back as the 1970s Atari), they can fix them, too--cleaning cartridge contacts, replacing lasers for disc-systems, or even buffering scratched CDs. I recommend Play Again Classic Video Games for those who want to get back into the games they grew up with, and for those whose games have stopped functioning.]
