[118070781500717367487,100066144194149867039,My family and I have been frequenting La Orient in Esher High Street for close on 10 years. In that time the standard has never faltered: Consistently great food, excellent relaxed ambiance and superb service by management and team who have all been there since I can remember. Love the place. Possibly the best restaurant in the whole of South West London. (And heavens have I wasted money at some places!). We've booked for tomorrow night - can't wait.]
