[105191298228460776709,100097294493173646817,Recently went in to get a used car with low income (which proves difficult for obvious reasons) and these guys were able to get me financed on an 08 Sentra. Rob Plume and John Hayes were both a lot of help: they were very kind, prompt, and took the time to show me around the lot and help me to feel comfortable. Love my car! Thanks, guys!]
