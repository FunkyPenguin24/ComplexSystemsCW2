[105459525276960201395,100175634213265291684,I got my wisdom teeth removed here on 5th Sept 2012. while giving the anesthesia they gave it to my nerve which caused l"lingual nerve injury" due to which my face got shaped out and i dont have control on one side of my face even 10 days after surgery. the doctor didnt even explain me dos and donts after the surgery. when asked after surgery can I go for running after surgery he said "you can", but when i searched in the net I should not as any physical exercise will cause over bleeding. they are completely money minded and there is no process, they dont even maintain patient record on their side. avoid this place.]
