[103304010123925204797,100087771991065365132,I have no idea why Mr. Gordon would say it's like Ruby Tuesday's or Chile's. It's a fast-food chicken joint with a slightly more upscale atmosphere. Think Popeye's with the decor of McCallister's Deli. The food was pretty good, though. And the onion rings were excellent.]
