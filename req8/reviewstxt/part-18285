[102917807012332078400,101144418019154202330,The hotel, hotel staff and location are great. Unfortunately hotel management and Holiday Inn customer service is a whole different story. Had reservations for the NHL Winter Classic. The hotel charged my cc a no show fee even though the reservation was cancelled with supporting documentation. Very disappointing! I have stayed here numerous times due to its great location. I understand mistakes can happen but the VERY, VERY poor customer service and complete lack of communication from the Hotel managment, Holiday Inn and IHG hotels is extremely upsetting. Looks like ill be staying at one of the many other Downtown Detroit hotel... Marriott, Courtyard, Greektown, Hilton Garden Inn etc. No amount of renovations are worth the headache]
