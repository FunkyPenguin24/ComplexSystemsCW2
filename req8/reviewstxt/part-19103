[105896356794908066232,100011234963373285898,About a week ago I traveled to Carrollton, Georgia to visit Scott Evans Nissan to inquire about a trade-in and see what kind of inventory they have there. I traveled from Peachtree City to Carrollton due to Scott Evans having the ability to match me with my wants and needs when making a seamless transition between automobiles. Once I arrived to the lot I was immediately impressed with the overall presentation (cleanliness, organization, as well as employees) of the facility. I met with an associate named Lauren Mandler, she was extremely knowledgeable about what has on her lot that fit my price range and even had a folder with potential vehicle fits. She basically built a profile for me before I arrived, which made for a productive afternoon instead of me kicking tires and reading window stickers. Lauren was extremely accommodating working with me and my credit issues, helping put things into perspective before such a major purchase. While Lauren was running back and forth addressing my questions I couldn’t help but notice how friendly the rest of the sales team at Scott Evans was. Members of the team came up and introduced themselves making me feel welcome. After a couple of test-drives later we successfully narrowed down what car best fit me and my financial abilities. Toward the end of our visit Lauren gave plenty of information about the vehicle we settled on and I will be returning as soon as possible considering I don’t suspect the car will be on the lot very long. All in all, I’m impressed to say the least with Scott Evans and his employees. I have tried Union City, Jonesboro, and Newnan before settling on Scott Evans Nissan in Carrollton and will be returning for all of my future vehicle needs. (9.8 out of 10)]
