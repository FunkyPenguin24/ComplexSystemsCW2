[108796031056441833765,100568171021504237678,Nice place, seemed clean and was pretty quiet. Small indoor pool but it looked inviting and well-maintained. My only complaint is it is 2 levels and there's no elevator (that we could find). We were on the second floor and lugged all our stuff up the stairs ourselves, and then back down again for check-out.]
