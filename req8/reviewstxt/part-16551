[100792150981481322219,101049806664841976122,DO NOT USE THIS SERVICE!!!!!!! PAY MORE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE!!!!!!! If there were a lower scoring I would use it, poor-fair doesn't descirbe the "service" this company provides. When you call they will tell you get a "full bar" in the limo...it's mostly soda. They will also tell you that you get VIP access to about 12 clubs in Denver, unfortunitly thier drivers don't have the list of clubs or know where they are located. I booked thier service for a bachelor party and I was sorely disapointed. I was told SEVERAL times that I was getting a black Chrysler and got a white one. The driver was lost ALL NIGHT, using nav on his phone to find addresses, the raido in the car didn't work and the driver didn't know how to fix it. We even called for a pick up twice and got a voice mail. We told the driver where to pick us up and were told TEN MINUTES, then watched the car drive right past us. When I called to complain I was blown off and told that I should have "read the contract"......REALLY????? Does the contract say you will get crappy service??? It should.]
