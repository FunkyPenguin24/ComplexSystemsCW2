[113248561902992824112,101104677934255992572,My husband and I went yesterday to buy guitar strings and picks. There were not many people in the store, it was close to closing time, and as soon as we came in we were attended. We did not have a chance to browse or walk around the store. After our purchase, the sales clerk directed us to the lady by the door to check out. She took everything out of the bag and took like 5 minutes to check that the items on the receipt were the items we paid for. It made me extremely uncomfortable and I felt like I was treated like a thief. While she was there, why not include a freaking pat down. If the clerk put the items in the bag himself, there was no need for such an extreme order purchase verification. Next time, I will tell my husband to buy the items he needs for his guitar online through another retailer. I don't need to feel like the TSA is in a guitar store. Seriously...]
