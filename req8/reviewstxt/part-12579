[100495069744022308339,100832566770971206662,We come here a lot and we love it. Classy, pricy, Italian food. Some dishes, such as the ravioli, won't fill you up. You really need to talk to people to know which dishes are the best or just try them yourself. I highly recommend the pork chops with the sliced potatoes, peppers, and onions. I usually wind up taking 1 of the 2 pork chops home. I would have given 5 stars, but there are some drawbacks. The waiters can be strange, and the background music skips sometimes and sounds funny lol. It gets busy during dinner time, 5 p.m. to closing. If your a passerby and are looking for a inexpensive meal, you should go to some of the other restaurants on Washington Ave. In my opinion, this is more of a place for locals. I've never been to the bar area, but it looks pretty good. If your looking for a taste of Nutley and Belleville's Italian food, this is the place to go.]
