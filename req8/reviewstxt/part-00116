[111664608882938014892,100164838022392684727,Vito's is a great family restaurant with a friendly staff, excellent service, and amazing food. This was the best pizza we have had in St. Louis! The atmosphere is just what we expected and the drinks were fabulous as well. I would recommend Vito's to anyone. Cheers!]
