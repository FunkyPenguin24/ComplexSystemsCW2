[105324010768084332296,100723825789351530940,okay - it's not a lavish resort - our room was big, bathroom huge, and unlike the other guy, wookie, plenty of hot water. the GOOD: 24 hour room service, card grants you access to only your floor, they don't allow loud crazy people in rooms, the food was good, i had wings and cheesecake at JavaCafe. staff was nice, ice machine convenient. covered parking with a cat walk to guard ya from the elements. the BAD: (not thaaat bad) a lil dirt on the comforter, the chair and foot stool were stained (just a spot) the shower curtain was frayed a lil and a few of the stations on the tv didn't work - couldn't order a movie. one thing i did also notice - our coffee station was missing stir sticks - it'd been opened, they were removed - and it's probable that the staff didn't notice it on clean up. it's an older place, smells a bit like smoke as most of the casinos do - but it's nice for what it is. i'd say built in the early 90's? limited updates but for 67 bucks - it's worth every penny. The snooty kids'll not be fan but the less fortunate not in the habit of having the latest and greatest will enjoy it juuuuuuuuuuust fine. it's free drink btw - while you gamble - if ya hate the room that much - go have a few more drinks and ya probably won't even notice. i'll def stay there again.]
