[101058733154022371552,100554617352639747575,Parking is a nightmare! No assigned spaces and very little control over unauthorized guest who park in the garage. The garbage room fills up with trash bags at least once weekly. The trash chute gets so filled residents just drop their trash bags in the room on the floor. Keith the main maintenance person is excellent. Responsive to residents needs 24hr/weekly. The office staff is extremely professional and again, Neil, Rachel and company respond immediately to resident concerns. It is a luxury apartment complex and you do feel as though you live in a special place. The horticulture is amazing. Well kept and watered. The Mansion itself is for rent to host parties..a great option!]
