[101651695563474121520,100131512719123706839,I have worked with Jamie at Sync3 for the past year and their service is excellent. I have now retained Sync3 to provide monthly maintenance and monitoring of my office computer systems and network, and to maintain our website. They are great to work with and always response and available when needed. They also set up my new offices with all new Ethernet lines in the walls in each office and new patch panel tied into the telephone room of the building floor. Also complete set up of our computers and network at our new office. Great work, and great follow up. I highly recommend Jamie and Sync3.]
