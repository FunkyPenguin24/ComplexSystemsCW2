[103578565035672457192,100679153217501005643,Casual place to bring a group - picnic tables outside are especially nice. Do the Fried Pickles and the Fried Chicken tacos - a must. Boiled peanuts are an acquired taste. The Flatbread was also pretty awesome and good to share. I tried the Black Bean Burger because I was trying to be "healthy" - good, but I would have just gotten the Fried Chicken tacos on a normal day. I got a Georgia Peach cocktail which was one of the best drinks I've ever had! Served with a grilled peach on top.]
