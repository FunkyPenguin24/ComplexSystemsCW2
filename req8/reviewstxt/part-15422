[102880642303294626999,100988701072664772279,Didn't even get in to see the Dr. Called for a general checkup and they insisted I see a Physician's Assistant instead of a Doctor. I waited 10 days for the appt. The Friday before my Monday appt they called around 11 am and left a message saying I was required to call them back within 4 hours to confirm or they'd give away my appt. I couldn't - I work full time and wasn't able to make a personal call within their prescribed 4 hour window. Wasn't my initial calling to schedule the appointment enough of a confirmation? Not sure why I'm forced to call again. Was a total inconvenience and a waste of time so I'm on the look out for a better Dr.]
