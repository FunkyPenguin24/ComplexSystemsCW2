[105150801912360221371,100864755418061293038,There were about 8 other customers in the restaurant yet it took 10 minutes for a waitress to even acknowledge us. They were out of the first 2 beers I ordered, we waited at least 40 minutes for our food, and then it was mediocre at best. I thought for sure given the inconviences (we were pretty vocal about the food taking so long) there'd be some sort of a discount, even it was a coupon for a free appetizer, but no effort was made. The decor has been the same since this location opening (15 years ago?). The Bloomington location closed a few years ago and I'm guessing this one will soon as well.]
