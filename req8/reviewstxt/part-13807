[100929136107588465805,100901101199467008189,Best Micro Brewpub in Louisville. We love this type of place and were really happy to locate Cumberland Brews right here in Louisville and only a short walk to Bardstown road from home. They have a great atmosphere, an awesome staff, excellent pub fare food - we love the Ky Bison Burger and we always enjoy their great beer. If you get a chance check out the upstairs area, very cozy and nice.]
