[112855437837472417189,101084380122440412733,I have had 2 body contouring sessions out of the 8 I purchased so far and can say I have had a great experience. This is not my first time having body contouring done so I do have something to compare it to and there is no comparison. Tana was very professional and curtiouse to me. She took the time to make sure I was comfortable, which I was. The equimpment was up to date and the room was pleasant. I would highly recommend going to LaserPro MedSpa to anyone looking for body contouring treatments. I am so looking forward to seeing the end results of my sessions!!]
