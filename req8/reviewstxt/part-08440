[116149717872307722239,100610478394706441288,My package? I called on Friday after my Amazon order said "Delivered left at front door." There was no package at my front door. I call the Tampa, FL office and spoke to a lady who said she would call the driver and find out where my package was left. The driver said he might have left it at the wrong house (using GPS and obviously cannot see the LARGE house numbers on house). She said he would deliver it that evening and she would call me back. None of those things actually happened. And I didn't have my items for my party that I paid for as promised by the $80 Prime Membership I pay to Amazon. I've spoken to many of my friends and they have had the same experience with your "delivery" company. UPS and Fed-Ex have ALWAYS delivered on time. I sincerely hope you lose Amazon's contract because you don't deserve the business. And I sincerely hope Amazon learns that although your bid no doubt was lower it is not worth it if they lose Amazon Prime subscriptions. Best Regards, Where is my package in Madeira Beach]
