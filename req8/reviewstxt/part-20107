[104234352371998316654,100065815273303905922,I work across the street from here and have to say; the food is pretty good. The chips are fresh fried, and sometimes, you even get about 1/4" of the frier oil in the bottom of the basket. The salsa leaves a lot to be desired, though edible (tastes like tomato sauce with a few spices). That being said, I'll probably be back. Probably.]
