[107410244966661466331,100560939186779315318,I had a n nice experience. Great price for the room, clean, and nice set up. Very Polite receptionist. Parking is a bit pricy, but very worth the price considering the 100.00 ticket I got for being one minute late to move my car from the street. The Restroom was a bit cramped, but overall nice room.]
