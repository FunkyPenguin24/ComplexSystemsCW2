[103714095885546007375,100942812931895704319,We visited T&K for repair of our used car we purchased a while back. They accommodated us on short notice. Staff was courteous. Manager is pompous and overrates his work. Obviously customers pay for the service, but you gotta do the work "complete". We found that cost is 20-25% above NTB/Discount-Tire/Firestone etc. Our car break were squeaking before we dropped our car for service. When we drove back home after repair, it was STILL same. Manager their will push you into buying more stuff out of their place rather than fixing problems at hand. Battery replacement cost insanely high and the battery brand was never heard off. Looks like some cheap option. I will never visit this place, nor recommend it !!!]
