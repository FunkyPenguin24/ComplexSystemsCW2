[101351917345293653332,101173492185734731089,We got our 6 month old puppy there about 3.5 months ago. He is a Pit/Lab mix and just an awesome animal. We live in a rental and they did check out with our landlord and ask a lot more questions about us and our past. Gauss is a huge part of our family and we are so happy that we found him and they let us have to time to get to know him before we got him. We previously adopted two cats there, Pixel and Bit as 7 week old kittens who had been abandoned. They were both sick, which they had let us know about and also explained that it would be easier to recover in a home. We were really nervous about Bit, who would not eat or drink and they walked us through the process of caring for them. They are both healthy and loving animals. The vats have also been great, they all remember him and our two cats. They do care about the animals and it is sad to see the state of some of the animals that go into the vet clinic. It is just hard to get in for an appointment sometimes and they don't always run on time due to the amount of animals they have to serve... hence the very good instead of excellent.]
