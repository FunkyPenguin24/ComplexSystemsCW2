[117284076693801077225,100039334434997499576,The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice. We were even treated to a surprise performance by a well known jazz musician. The service in the restaurant is awful. We had a reservation for 1:30pm. We were seated promptly within five minutes of arrival. Our salads arrived within 15 minutes of ordering, however the entree did not arrive until much later. We were not served our entree until 2:35pm. The waiter refreshed our soft drinks and water several times, however he did not offer an explanation as to why the food was taking so long to come out of the kitchen. The waiter also double charged our credit cards. He attempted to explain that he had to wait for his manager to revise the charges which in turn took another 30 minutes. If you decide to visit the restaurant, I would suggest that you have exorbitant amount of time for dinner or just have drinks.]
