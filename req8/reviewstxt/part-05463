[118216447637140581372,100449409287211976205,I love Trader Joe's, This location does have great prices on the majority of their food items,the employees are always helpful and very upbeat and polite and always ready to help you find an item,if out of stock,recommend a similar item,the only problems I have with the store is that the meat prices are very high and their parking lot,it is a nightmare,but all in all,this is a great place to shop,I highly recommend.]
