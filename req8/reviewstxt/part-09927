[104353032029621247353,100689325767668930832,I landed here looking for > 2010 car. They had precisely was they had advertised in Autotrader and their stock (I had been to other places they didn't have what they had listed). Used cars I tried were cleaned up and maintained for the best experience. They work with you on the pricing, but as in every other place, be ready to deal with professionals, yet kind and enthusiastic sales personnel. I worked with Tyrone and Kalvin, and they are both great, but also bounded by their managers on what they can do for you. Kalvin took the time to show me a great car, and he was not wrong when he said the car was in great conditions and an excellent car. You never know when what somebody is telling you is the truth, but in my case, Kalvin was right and he introduced me to an excellent car. I tried 5 other places with the same kind of car 2010+ Acura and Hondas. The best of those I tried at this place and at the Acura itself, although Acura had higher prices ($3000+) I think. Other places, the cars did not just run as well or were more deteriorated. Overall, I recommend looking around, then landing at Honda Curry so that you can compare. I found them with higher quality for the price. Thank you.]
