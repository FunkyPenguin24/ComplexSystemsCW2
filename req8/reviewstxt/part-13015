[106576726578269057976,100857736980244394833,Simple menu, expertly done. Service is good and fast, even when the place was rammed. You can pay more for a better steak in London, but only in a few places, and at least twice the price. Don't forget to venture downstairs for an excellent old fashioned, you can watch them carve you off a piece of crystal clear ice for your glass right in front of you. Arrive early. My part of 4 got there at 6 and we got one of the last tables.]
