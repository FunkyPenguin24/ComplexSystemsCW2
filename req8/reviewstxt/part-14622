[106468778585703986853,100946252135287316327,Great gym, very helpful and friendly staff; I would highly recommend personal training expert Luke Hayes. I have been involved in fitness for over 20 years and never had a personal trainer. I decided to try a session one day and it was the best decision I made. Lukeâ€™s knowledge and motivation has helped me reach the fitness goals I previously set and now I continue to set new goals I am confident I will achieve through his help. I would highly recommend Luke for anyone out there wanting to improve themselves and achieve results. Whether you are new to exercise or have years of experience Luke will make you a success in the gym.]
