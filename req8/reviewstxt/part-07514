[103647944939103478695,100561574016010864571,There is a reason why this shop has been around for 25+ years: Mark, the owner, know his stuff. When I started collecting comics I went to different stores, but this is the one I liked most. Been going there for 10 years now. The staff of this store is made up of only one: Mark. I see the other reviews regarding his bad attitude or bad tone of voice, but that's the way he speaks. You don't like it, go somewhere else. He won't be able to change his vocal chords for you. If you bring kids, just use "common sense" and keep your kids close, make sure they don't move or break something. Any store owner who deals collectibles will get pissy if you let your kids loose in the store. In my experience, he knows all about comics, sports, cars, collectibles in general, so it's fun to talk to him about any of this when going to pick up my stuff, it makes the trip more worthwhile. He has a lot of back issues dating decades back, a nice stash of CGC comics for sale, plus if you have a pull bag, he'll call you to ask if you want some variant coming out for a comic you might be collecting. That's personalized service. Give this store a chance. If not, no need to whine, there's plenty of places to get your comics fix in town. -OY]
