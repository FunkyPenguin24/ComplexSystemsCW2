[110500105195308460249,100917914496707361976,i work at PrintTime in Modesto and my boss got two small peach pies which were the BEST ive ever had. I HATE PIE... but wow did they change my expearience with pies. You can still taste all the freshness in the fruit with each bite. Had to google where they are... theyre a distance away :( at least for me. they should have a delivery system. i'd have they're baked goods each morning if i could.]
