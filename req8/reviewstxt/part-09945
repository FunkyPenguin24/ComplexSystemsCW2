[108031033578142521479,100690933831462415459,It was a mini-vacation with just me and the wife. We stayed in the cottages, they were very clean and spacious, and VERY reasonable for lodging on labor day weekend. Beautiful views outside the windows all around. Loved having a coffee in the morning enjoying the bluffs and the Mississippi. Rented a boat from the resort and did some fishing. we were centrally located from Alma and Nelson and just across the river from Wabasha. A big "THANK YOU" to Wes Stensland for making our stay comfortable and stress free. friendly folks! definitely would return]
