[115032570916126735880,100459424665427573807,These are NOT a luxury apartments! The neighbors don't follow the quiet hours from 10pm to morning. Fighting, partying, sex, and smoking is what my neighbors do religiously. The management will charge you for anything and everything after you move out! The old plywood of the cabinets are peeling and crumbling. The hinges of the cabinet doors are rusty. You need to know that there is nothing luxury about this place.]
