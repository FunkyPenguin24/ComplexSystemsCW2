[116917400841951301088,100886074069273405185,My favorite place.... I loved Chef when he was at Swoon in Hudson, and at AFITR they do what excites them and you'll love it too! Great feeling of community and a connection to local ingredients. Inventive dishes every bit as good as NYC, but healthier and a bit cheaper! Lots of Bard kids and families which is nice. Dinner menu changes a lot which is always a good sign even though you fall in love with a dish and then it's gone... Front of house is more casual and friendly than professional which I can live with. Dessert & coffee service always seems to fall apart, but the plates and entrees are the stars here. They've upgraded the short wine list with Rosenthal selections which is great, and are happy to let you taste beforehand. Children are welcome and the burgers and homemade sodas are excellent and healthy too! Must try the homemade mozzarella & awesome Hudson bread w/ salty chocolate Share, experiment, and expect to fight for the last forkful]
