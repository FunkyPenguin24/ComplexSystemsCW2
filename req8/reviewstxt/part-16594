[104231566246502012991,101052813229888940767,Checked in 5-20-2013 and checked out 5-26-2013. Worker gave me an amazing weekly rate. Much cheaper than staying off of Fowler. Located in a quite town right on the out skirts in Tampa in Wesley Chapel. Its actually located behind the Cracker Barrel between that in the Groves Mall shopping plaza. No jacuzzi but the pool is large and there are plenty of chairs for me and my colleagues. Breakfast was provided, staff was friendly, prices were amazing. Will save my company money by booking with this hotel for our next conference.]
