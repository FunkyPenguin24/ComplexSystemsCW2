[102007834339274374566,101172658122974863104,After reading the other review I needed to post my experience. I have been seeing this practice for years. I couldn't be more pleased and recommend them to anyone looking for a primary physician. The reasons M gave for not liking are the very reasons I left my previous physician. I never wait for scripts, never have trouble getting an appointment AND my NP respects the decisions I make regarding my health.]
