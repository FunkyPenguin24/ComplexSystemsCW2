[103027075983735195382,100976269940614061312,I have used the services of Covina Animal Hospital for 30 plus years and our cherished pets (over the years, a couple of cats and several dogs) have received the best of medical and kennel care. The veterinary doctors fully explain any treatment our pets may need, or have received, leaving little necessity for follow-up questions. Additionally, the staff is equally professional and courteous, leaving us confident that our pets get the best of care. I highly recommend the animal hospital to pet owners who are seeking expert and caring medical attention for their pets.]
