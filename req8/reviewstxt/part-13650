[113801398195487798710,100893218523297340700,Nick Mildfelt was the sales person that helped us. He is awesome at what he does, made us feel welcomed. He took his time with us and answered all of our question. This was our first time visiting Rusty Eck Ford and will not be our last. Thank you Nick and everyone else that helped us in my daughters first car buying experience!]
