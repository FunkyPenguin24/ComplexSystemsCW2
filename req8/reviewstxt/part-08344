[102791618971778038016,100605892434836759909,Some time ago I brought my 14 year old son here after he had injured his foot during a soccer match. He was in serious pain and naturally my wife and I were very concerned. Fortunately, it turned out to be only a minor sprain, but I will never forget how attentive and personable the staff was. They managed to calm our fears and promptly took care of our son. Since then, we have continued to use the VHMA services when the need arises. We have always been very pleased with the treatment and I have never felt as though we were being hurried in-and-out. Their rates are also reasonable. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to anyone. Two thumbs up for a great little medical center!]
