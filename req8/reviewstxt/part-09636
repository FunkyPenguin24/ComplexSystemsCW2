[102535605011913702661,100673687930040537638,I have NEVER liked this place.. and I don't know if there is new management now or what but it has gotten even worse.. it was dark.. dirty and the food was so bad that my 10yr old son refused to eat it... the kid is normally up for eating anything and everything!! When we complained about dried out chicken.. burned food and lack of items on the bar at dinner we were told " we always make it like that" and " nothing is wrong" We will NOT be back!!! If your looking for great local Chinese go to the one in Fosterbrook near walmart!]
