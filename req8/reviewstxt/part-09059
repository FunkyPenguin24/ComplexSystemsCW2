[109325644533909256705,100641856670564475349,I paid Craig a $10,000.00 dollar deposit, and I got NOTHING!!! No only did I get attitude, and hang ups from Craig, but he actually STOLE my sofas that he was going to re-upholster!!!! He didn't make a contract with me, and before he was going to deliver he threw a curve ball stating that his Policy ( which he had NEVER mentioned before) stated that payment needed to be made in full prior to the delivery!! UNHEARD of. Save your money, and go somewhere else!!! You don't need his attitude, and shadiness and lack of integrity!!!]
