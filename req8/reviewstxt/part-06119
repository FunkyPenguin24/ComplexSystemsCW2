[100802277688409738603,100483817808102138119,Great experience at this sweet little hotel. Unbeatable location, friendly and competent staff, really thoughtful and unique amenities. My room was clean, comfortable, and so many useful touches, such as a full-length mirror, iPod doc with sleep sounds, and a closet just down the hall with extra pillows, blankets, toothbrushes, etc. I strongly suggest avoiding the hotel restaurant - my herb omelette was terribly overcooked, completely unseasoned, and swimming in vegetable oil next to some potato crumbles and the service was well below what I encountered in the hotel itself.]
