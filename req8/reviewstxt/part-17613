[114451670118955121351,101109383121609696042,The food was great and always loved to go there on Saturdays. The pizza and potato/chicken was the best dinners to have hands down. One of the locations in Palmdale had the Asteron Belt LaserDisc arcade game. That alone made the trip worth every time. I miss going there. I now live in Texas and no one's ever heard of the restaurant unless they themselves come from California.]
