[116272822110806238956,100190231704003921031,First off as soon as I walked in I was greeted by Bob who answered any questions I had. I used to sell cars so I know how the whole sales world goes. But Bob was just a genuine person beyond trying to sell me anything. What's funny is I told him I was "just looking". Before I knew it I was purchasing a Gibson LPJ. Amazing guitar!!! Very affordable and you get that all American Gibson sound I've been dreaming to own for 15 years. I can honestly say that if it wasn't for the crew and how nice everyone was I really would have just kept looking. I could have held out for another month and gone back home to Texas to purchase the Gibson from a Guitar Center where the customer service is as bad as a smelly fart. Instead I bought at George's in Springfield, PA. Again thank you guys for your "southern hospitality". I will be coming by soon to say my goodbyes to all of you and maybe have a few cold ones as well!]
