[102288824000737287820,100986796252189051535,We moved from Corona to Carlsbad with a very short, yet critical timeframe to find a home. Kids school, work timing, high standards for a new home and the fact that we had a contract with renters moving into the current home we were living in made for a complex house hunt. So I called Brent at Humpherys Homes because I knew that Brent would deliver like he had when we purchased another property in Downtown San Diego a few years earlier. Within 24 hours of looking with Brent, we had found an incredible home only to find out that our offer was the 3rd offer. Brent skillfully and strategically guided us through this process that had the seller accept our offer over the other two. It was pure genius. I love Brent's energy, dedication and most of all his integrity. Both my wife and I knew through the entire process we were dealing with a pro. I usually don't do endorsements like this but this is a no-brainer for me. If you're looking for an agent, I highly recommend Humphery's Homes. And if I ever think about moving again (though not planning on it any time soon) Brent is my first and only call. Mike and Jennifer Foster]
