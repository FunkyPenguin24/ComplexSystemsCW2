The Food- I had the Red Snapper (Alex Style) - it was the best fish that I had in the Dominican (better than my resort). I also enjoyed a great tasting rice dish... just can't recall it's name. The Decor- Probably the best thing about the restaurant is the decor. Simply stated BEAUTIFUL. It looks exactly like the pictures on the website. The Service- The waiter, Manuel, was courteous, made great recommendations, answered our questions about the restaurant, and showed us pictures of events held at the Jellyfish. Honorable Mention- After dinner we walked outside to admire the exterior decor and the beach. We decided to take pictures but we were struggling to take our own photos. Manuel noticed our dilemma and came out to help us. Overall, we really enjoyed Jellyfish, it was the "Food" highlight of our vacation.]
