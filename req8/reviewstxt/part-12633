[105867555549896649768,100835853492258890358,7 girlfriends and I booked a table last Friday night for a few cocktails during happy hour. We loved how personable the staff was considering how busy the bar was, service was very good. Our table was at the very back of the bar which allowed us to have our own little corner but still were able to interact with others. I will admit, we were jealous of the birthday party guests and their hats and poppers. Will definitely be booking for parties in the future.]
