[104442299959776804369,100108975893122017452,If you miss being treated like a child, the Axiom is a perfect place for you. My wife and I moved into the Axiom because we appreciated the management's lax approach to needless "rules," which seemed overabundant in other D.C. apartment buildings. And besides the astronomical prices, our first year living here was pleasant enough. Unfortunately, a company called Bozzuto recently purchased the building and is ruining everything that was once great about the Axiom. Now no one is allowed to use the pool after 9 PM (despite the fact that this is where the grills are located and many of us eat dinner after 9 PM); no more than 50 people are allowed on the roof at once (despite hundreds, if not thousands, living in the building); tenants are forced to wear ridiculous bracelets whenever going onto the roof; tenants are only permitted one guest per apartment (last summer my wife and I often had over another couple, this year we're forced to choose just one of them to visit at a time); and all of these rules are enforced under the watchful eyes of a rent-a-cop. Most establishments reward loyalty, but at the Axiom, rents skyrocket after living in the building for more than a year. This is probably why the building is struggling to maintain its occupancy. That and the surrounding environs lack everything you would want in a neighborhood (unless everything you want is a baseball stadium). The people who live in the Axiom are living here because of its amenities. Unfortunately, the new management company is stripping away these amenities without any reduction in rent or any improvements elsewhere. For instance: the treadmill in the gym is eternally broken, at least one grill is always out of gas, and the elevators are unreliable at best. Unless and until Bozzuto changes its new rules regime, definitely look to live elsewhere.]
