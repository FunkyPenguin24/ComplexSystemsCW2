[110319403333069080318,101132620147685637181,My wife and I had our first trip to Savannah and stayed at the President's Quarters 5 years ago. We had the time of our lives! We just love the quaint charm of the Quarters and the staff was very accomodating. Centrally located, safe and quiet. We keep coming back for more!]
