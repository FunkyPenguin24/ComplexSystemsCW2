I've told all my friends about them and they have enjoyed them just as much as me. The wait staff is always pleasant. Depending upon the time of day the food may take awhile to get to you, but that's my only complaint. We eat there pretty regularly since our business is located nearby and my daughter thinks they have the best salads she has ever eaten. The Cobb Salad is her favorite.]
