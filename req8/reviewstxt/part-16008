[101519886926598747723,101021089478361817900,We stopped in here with the family for a quick bite while traveling through on I-64 last weekend to eat and let our 2 year old stretch his legs in the playroom. This was by far the dirtiest McDonald's I have seen. Every table in the resturant seemed to be dirty, the trash cans were full. The floor behind the counter was an absolute mess. Flys were buzzing about and the staff was not friendly. The play room equipment while in good shape needed to be cleaned. Needless to say I've ate in "greasy spoons" before that were much cleaner than this place. Do youself a favor and avoid this MCDs.]
