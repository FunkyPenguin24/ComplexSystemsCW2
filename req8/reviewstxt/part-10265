[101405332137765677698,100708818464258411579,Food is great, alcohol less so, I wouldn't go back in a hurry or queue for too long unless I craved a burger. Happy to say I've been and say people should try it. It really depends on what you are looking for and what expectations you go with as to how much you like this place, oh and how long you queue for. Food is very well priced and is rather tasty, the beef burger is superb in fact. I do think they over do the cheese, suppose they think it makes it American but it I couldn't taste the dog in my chilli dog. I don't think the alcohol is all that amazing, decent but overly sweet cocktails regardless of what we ordered, they have character but didn't wow. Toilet was a bit of a state, but having been just the once I don't know if it was a one off.]
