[105464351409615817068,100664691635296229329,I went to visit Dr. Gamboa in a desperate plea for help with my back pain issues which have deteriorated over the years as a result of 2 horrific car accidents in the past. I was amazed to see that Desi (love that name) was more interested in giving me relief and hearing my story than filling out paperwork or identifying insurance or payment plans. I said that I was unemployed and needed to get back to work and he replied that we can work all that out later, lets just get you fixed, now that is how I would define a true human being.]
