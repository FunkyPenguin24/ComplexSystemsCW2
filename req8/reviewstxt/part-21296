[101767800450133474406,100128981433066517132,I absolutely love this program! After researching and visiting several other Karate Schools, we were certain that this was the best school for our 5-year old son. Mr. Rockhold is very skilled with kids, and he immediately captured our son's attention. He is extremely patient, while still holding each child accountable for practicing t...he correct technique/moves. The program was different than the others in that I did not have to sign a long-term contract. I also like that we can choose from several class options, and can change the day each week if need be. This will become more important in the fall when our son resumes his busy baseball schedule. I would highly recommend this school for any level of karate enthusiast.]
