[100482401945964104628,100995693778405588057,Excellet coffee shop! This is the only independent coffee shop in Monroe where you can sit down and relax while you drink your coffee and read a book. Everywhere else seems to be drive-through shops these days. At Paesano's, you can sit around the fireplace during the winter time and sip an eggnog latte and in the summertime you can sit outside and look out to Lake Tye while drinking an iced Americano. There isn't much of a food menu, but I like being able to snack on their fresh fruit, bagels, and scones and be able to leave without that "sick, bloated, ate too many ham and cheese paninis at Starbucks" feeling.The good news is that if you're really starving, there is a burger place and a teriyaki place right next door. All in all, this is a great coffee house and once the baristas get a little better at their latte art, it will be one of the few best places to get coffee in Snohomish county.]
