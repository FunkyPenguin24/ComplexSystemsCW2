It was full in the restaurant so we were offered a high table with fold-out bar stools - not the most comfortable table ever but it was good of them to accommodate us. Decor is fine - unpretentious, functional, quite middle of the road. Verging on boring... The service was very friendly - especially considering service charge was included. A refreshing change from the hurried, bustling service elsewhere in central London. I had the pork - it was tender and well cooked, and £16 was probably about right. My companions had the steak, which was a big piece of meat - £48 shared between two - perhaps a little on the expensive side but it was well cooked and tasty. We finished off our meal by sampling their home made vermouth - which was very impressive, especially the white, which had lovely herby, earthy flavours. All in all, I prefer somewhere a little more intimate and with a stronger sense of identity. It was a good evening, with helpful, friendly staff, and tasty (but not extraordinary) food.]
