Their other products are high. I always seem to be spending over 100 dollars everytime i go and im like for what. These are some real prices Morning Glory Product (hairspray) 10.99,lets jam (hair gel) 7.99, cantu (leave in conditioner) 5.99. The cantu i saw in walmart a week after i purchased it walmart is cheaper so is the jam. And it is ghetto fab in there. The music the person with a fully pierced face and getto girls looking tired and mad. But they will glady take your money.]
