[114360112889791201750,101074213208345473230,I am appalled that it took 1 hour and 45 min to get an oil change, inspection and tire rotation. It was actually more like 2 hours because I was early. I have never had a 45 min oil change in my life dealer or commercial. I never usually file or post complaints but when I called the manager to talk to him about what happened I was told that I was out earlier then I should have expected and they gave me a free car wash. I have never heard of a 45 min oil change and certainly not 2 hours for routine maintenance and the wonderful car wash that I should have appreciated so much consisted of a hose wetting my car. I will never be back!!!!!]
