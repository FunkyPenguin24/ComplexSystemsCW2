[115309255074449657145,101016610667125377825,My perfectly good iPhone 4 stopped working immediately after deleting the Facebook app. The Home button was no longer operational. Additionally, the Home button on Assistive Touch was not operational. The phone is over a year old, so the Apple Store wouldn't do anything about it (other than offer to swap it for a new one for $150. They referred me to iExpert Studio in the Kenwood Mall. I went there and explained my problem. The support person was puzzled when he learned that the Assistive Touch wasn't working. He asked if he could take the cover off. I said sure. He took it off, and reset the battery, and voila! All is working again. He didn't charge me anything, and within 5 minutes I was walking out of the mall with a working iPhone. A very happy customer! Thanks iExpert Studio :)]
