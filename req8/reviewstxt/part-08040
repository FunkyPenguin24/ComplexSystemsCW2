[117471541271420826855,100589814273501261278,Have been on work for 4 weeks and booked an extended stay. The only reason is I get paid a very low per diem and this was the only hotel in my budget in the downtown area - about 10 mins walk from the Financial District where I needed to commute for work. For the price, I would give it 3.5 stars of 5. As others have pointed out, majority of the staff is polite and helpful. One can forgive the odd one - and I can say this because I stayed here for 4 weeks. The room is extremely small and crampy, old beds, worn out bedspreads and bedsheets, but clean nonetheless. They do your bed on a daily basis, and entertain most requests. I needed a hot-plate and a microwave since I am very picky about food and prefer to cook - they had no issues at all providing me with that. Internet sucks, video streaming is blocked, pretty slow - but for $5 for the entire stay - it's manageable if all you do is reply to e-mails and do random browsing. Overall - decent place. I would have preferred a bigger room for a little more - but they don't have that option. If you are in the downtown area, and need a place to stay for a couple of days, this is definitely doable. Worth considering on a tight budget, and other hotels in the downtown area will not even entertain the request for a hot plate.]
