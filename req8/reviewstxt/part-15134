[102442076045355832519,100973872073977815241,Went in for IPhone screen (was cracked) repair. Was told it would take a day and it would be fixed, 2 month later and I finally got my IPhone back. Was quoted £40, ended up costing me £160. Terrible service, everything seems dodgy and underhand. Would never user them again or allow any of my friends or family to use them.]
