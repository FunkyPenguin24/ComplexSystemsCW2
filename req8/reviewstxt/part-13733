[102874498128408243989,100897818756666367905,I love the Love Dog Cafe! This quaint cafe on Lopez Island is always on our list of places to eat when we visit the island. I am amazed at the wide variety of choices the Love Dog offers including many vegan and gluten free options. Our family includes carnivores, vegetarians, seafood lovers and those with gluten allergies. The Love Dog menu offers multiple choices for each person in our party no matter their dietary restrictions or preferences - including a kids menu. Plus, all of the ingredients are fresh, local and, when ever possible, organic. The Love Dog offers high quality food and many choices - which is surprising considering the size of the island. Some of my family's favorite dishes are the portabella mushroom burger, the handmade pizzas, the salmon burger (gluten free bread option) and the house salad. The Love Dog Salad Dressing is out of this world delicious (had to get a bottle to take home). The Pot-of-Chocolate dessert is a wonderful (very) rich treat that we enjoy sharing. The weather was beautiful this evening so we chose to sit outside to enjoy the sunset throughout our meal. We had a lovely meal with a great atmosphere and good service. We will be back soon!]
