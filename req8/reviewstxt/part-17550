[105291823608532910883,101105953475391942542,We had some expectations to purchase a used Honda in the near future after much on-line research. My 2001 Accord has 260,000 miles and continues to serve our family well. We got the our initial lead from on-line sites like carguru and auto trader. We were focused with what we wanted (price/value/type) which made our visit very focused. Our sales associate, Jordan D, was a pleasure to work with for a number of reasons. He was prompt in returning emails and phone calls, and during his day-off, the car sales manager was able to respond promptly. He was not overly persuasive in his approach yet he was willing to show us as many cars as we desired. We feel we received a fair price for the vehicle and they will fix a paint bubble/ chip on the front fender without extra cost. I refrain from a 5-star rating because we are only a few days into our car. When I return to get the paint fixed or scheduled maintenance I hope they earn the last star. On a personal note, I can say Jordan continues to show great character as a former active-duty Marine in showing our family respect and honor. We wish Jordan the best in all he does. If you want someone that will actually listen and not hound you every turn, Jordan is your guy.]
