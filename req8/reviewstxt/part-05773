[103530103761461462620,100465479302372889211,They have poor product selection. Their customer service is below average. Why would anyone want to shop at Gunnies? Go to Cabelas or anywhere else. I tried to do a return. They went to great lengths to make sure that it was impossible to do. If they are going to do that on a $30 item, what are they going to do to you if you try to return a more expensive item? I know that I will *never* shop there again and will tell anyone else that will listen to never shop there too.]
