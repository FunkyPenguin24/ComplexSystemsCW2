[105035982828840816287,101117640423921585965,O'Toole's has a nice selection of comfort foods in a laid back atmosphere. Live music and other in-restaurant activities can be very entertaining. The best seat in the house, on a chilly winter's day, is around the fireplace. Definitely a good place to go for a few drinks, hang out with friends, and relax.]
