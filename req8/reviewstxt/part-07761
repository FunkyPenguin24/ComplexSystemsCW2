[105157404836693442225,100574719536531603878,Well, our company went online about a year and a half ago and we quickly realized that in order to be attract customers we had to get our site optimized. We did a little research and eventually decided that ebrandz had the best rates for the most keywords. Basically if I had to sum it up, ebrandz drives guests to our site. Their work helps put us on the "map" so to speak and through their services we were able to quickly climb the google ladder and start appearing under search queries - so ultimately we get the greatest benefit there is in business - Sales and Profits.]
