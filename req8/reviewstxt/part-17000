[104699454236923718454,101075235595566719938,I seriously like this place. Great variety of dawgs, crazy creations, and lots of great toppings. My favorite is the downtown dog - a big bacon warpped dawg with mayo, onions, mustard and I add jalapanoes. Just like downtown but without the food poisoning! Seriously, they have so many great creations and funny names like the Abe Fromans (remember Ferris Bueler?).]
