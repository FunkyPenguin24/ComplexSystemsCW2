[113831267041438131160,101061661658869939974,Usually do HD authorized rentals but this Eagle Rider was located 5 miles from airport and 5 miles from our timeshare unit and they had a shuttle, with a very helpful nice driver, to pick us up and drop us off. Probably saved us $75 in cab rides. Very nice staff. Had an Ultra for a week and put 900 miles on it so had lots of fun for $1/mile. Take a rain suit, they don't rent or furnish them.]
