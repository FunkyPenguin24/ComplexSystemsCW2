[106941218394408163206,100838464584576357997,Can't get enough of this place! It is a little price and the portions might be a little smaller on some items that you're used to (but no smaller than actual tapas from Espana), but the quality and flavor is nothing short of amazing. Great place to bring friends from out of town to "show off" Asheville. Great wines too. Can't wait to come back!]
