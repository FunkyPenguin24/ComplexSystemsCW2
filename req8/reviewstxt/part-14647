[108612139291350798610,100947414054232437324,I drove from Springfield, MO to St. Louis to buy a car because Todd Eversgerd, at Bommarito Nissan offered me such a great deal on a new Xterra. The prices were much better than those in Springfield, and I felt like I was being dealt with fairly and honestly - and that's important when buying a car. I now have a new dealership. It's a long drive, but I can catch a Cardinals game and buy a car next time!!! It was a very stress-free process and I never felt like I was being "taken" or lied to by Todd. He was just straight forward and I really enjoyed doing business with him.]
