[106574345930720287496,100218457036809639957,I would just like to say Thank you to Officer Woods for assisting us last Saturday night. We had a blow-out on our boat trailer on I-95 and the traffic never seemed to slow down, so I called *HP, but Officer Woods was the first to respond. He was very helpful and professional. I am a Councilperson in Williston, SC and hope that our officers are setting the same example as that of Officer Woods. Thank you, Wanda B. Matthews 310 Donna St Williston SC 29853]
