[107915038127201835594,100437126168649779982,Terrible experience ever for online order! My order was placed July 4th. 2012, about $6000.00. after 3 months waiting, of course with over 30 calls, just heard a bunch of lies from their customer service people, then I finally got my bedroom set, but the headboard and footboard had been scratched; the dresser was on hold, and I still didn't get it yet, today it is Jan. 7th. 2013, more than 6 months now. I called today, the customer service changed their phone number, nobody ever pick up the phone, I left message, nobody ever call back either. I emailed to Ann Marie and 3 more other emails, just give them 24 more hours, if no response, I have to dispute this charge throught credit card company, because simply nobody responds any more to the internet order customers. They also changed their name to the furniture plaze, I was told now there are different company from the furniture place galaries any more. It seems this company use customer's credit card payment to do business, never refund, until customer can't tolarate anymore and suffered too much, then dispute through credit company. At the end of Sep., I had to cancel my living room set, 3 months after the canceling date, still no refund. then I had to call credit card company to dispute it. I will file this to Attorney General in NY, BBB has less power to do anything to them, even some customer said the Attorney General is also just a paper tiger. We all have to do something to protect ourself, victims of the furniture place galaries.]
