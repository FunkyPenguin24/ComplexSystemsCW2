[104704696847683257785,100900850036859070332,If you live in the Brandon area and like Thai food I would highly recommend Lemon Grass Thai Kitchen. The service is excellent with friendly and helpful staff. They seem to really care about your experience. My wife and I went to try it out for lunch and where very pleased with the whole experience. If you've never tried Thai food give their buffet a try. It's clean and well managed and will give you the opportunity to try many different offerings to see what you like best. If you prefer not to eat at a buffet they have a full menu as well. You really can't go wrong. We can't wait to go again.]
