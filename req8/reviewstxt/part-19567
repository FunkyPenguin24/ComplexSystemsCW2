[102853251181802920533,100036784521755203400,When I first walked in I was almost overwhelmed by how many pieces their were inside, and I had walked to all the shops on Capitol Hill in search of the right piece. Not only are their a ton of options but everything is quality. Ive been to literally every public smoke shop in the greater Seattle area and hands down this is my favorite. Needless to say I found what I was looking for and even better, it was at a great price. Some of the things offered at SC&T are almost ridiculously cheaper then other places, which is so cool because they aren't some knock of pieces. My Maverick disk perc has become my favorite piece now and basically stole it when compared to literally any other shop. I will be going back many times in the future for sure.]
