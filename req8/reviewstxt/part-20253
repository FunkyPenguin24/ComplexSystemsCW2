[100928334188018530290,100073096289521377840,In the real estate business, insurance is essential. It is often a piece of the puzzle that clients leave until close to the end and Dexter has time and time again been my Hero. Dexter takes a different approach from other insurance agents I've worked with. Rather than just slapping together a standard quote and coverage, he gets to know the house, my clients and their goals. If ever I have a question about a home, if it will qualify or what the premium will be, I can just give him a quick call and he'll get me what I need. He has even driven out to homes on a field visit just to make sure it won't have any issues when the inspector comes by. Dexter is also very diligent in staying on top of his files. If I put him in touch with a client, I don't have to double check that they've been taken care of - it is a guarantee. I also work with many investors and a lot of the properties being sold today wouldn't work for a standard policy due to their condition. Dexter has an extensive network of policies and providers to find insurance for any property I've taken him.]
