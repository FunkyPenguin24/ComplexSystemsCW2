[101330153125577086945,100819866653206029118,Went to the restaurant on 7/27/13 at around 12:15 am (they close at 1). We were staying in downtown cinci for the first time, and walked all the way there from the Cincinnatian hotel. We were met by a very salty hostess who couldn't muster up a word to welcome us, but rather raised her eyebrows in a smirk as if to say "can i HELP you?". She told us that we could seat ourselves at the bar. We proceeded to, but I was so annoyed by the experience that I could not even enjoy the one beer that I had. We promptly closed our check and went to Yard House, which is directly down the street, where we had an AMAZING experience. The hostess was upbeat, they walked us to our table even though it was in that bar. I have been a server in the past for 5 years and have seen a lot of behavior and am usually understanding and tolerable when I go to restaurants, but this was in complete poor taste.]
