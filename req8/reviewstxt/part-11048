[110124630957750771472,100750698557540270056,My family has been going to Affinity for years! I love coming up to Estes Park for the relaxation the mountains provide and adding a massage after a hike is always a special treat! All the massage therapists have done a really nice job relieving tension and stress I carry. The environment is always soothing and inviting. I cannot wait to see their new location!]
