[100265498355474253516,100692962744346301855,I like this place so much I made my corporate HQ use it as our default PDX hotel. Rooms are big, beds are above average comfort and big granite desks with flat screens are great for business travelers. To the guy who said there's no fan in the bathrooms; there is, itâ€™s just an always on whole building fan that constantly exhausts the air.]
