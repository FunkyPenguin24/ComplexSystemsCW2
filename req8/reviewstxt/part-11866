[104717382258916778158,100793857049961086109,The worst service ever. The server didn't take the orders properly got me pancakes instead of waffles. Then there were ham pieces in the chicken crepe. We don't eat ham so when we pointed out the mistake to her, she just justified it as being a mistake. No apology and no effort to resolve the issue. I have to other IHOPs and their service was good. but this is the worst outlet of IHOP ever!]
