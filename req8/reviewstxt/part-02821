[104111212945450345927,100304351371042180811,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!! When the waitress brought our food out, between three adults the sushi was all mixed up on everyone plates, and she instructed US to just switch it around. At this point, I was fine with that, mistakes happen. Half way through we realize we didn't even get the right sushi, so we told her. She told us we were wrong and that my Eel Roll was in fact a Salmon Roll, when it clearly was not. Continued to argue with us that we were wrong. She said she was going to ask the chef, and came back and still insisted that we were wrong. The manager then came over and this is where it gets bad. She points to my sushi, hovering over me, shoving her armpit in my face!!! Then proceeds to say, oh yeah your right, that's not salmon. Then tells us that they will credit us for the rolls they got mixed up. Fine, whatever. Then....walks back over to our table, PICKS UP MY CHOP STICKS THAT I WAS EATING WITH, AND TAKES MY SUSHI OFF MY PLATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What?!!??!?! And the sushi tasted like crap. NEVER AGAIN!]
