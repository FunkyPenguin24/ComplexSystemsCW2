[104092351193151114208,100533968209551058687,This AMPM have the rudest, laziest, gang-like workers behind the counter. It looks like they've been picked from a Mexican street gang and slapped on an AMPM uniform. Several times they short changed us but didn't not apologize and acted as if it's a norm to cheat customers! The only reason this place gets customers is its gas prices are relatively lower than others in the area. ARCO should yank their license or do something before the employees of this place start shooting at customers!]
