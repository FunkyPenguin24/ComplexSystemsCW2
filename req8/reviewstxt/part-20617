[111680663239214353338,100091875077703237502,Would NEVER recommend this place. I have had 30+ years dealing with different vets, had numerous dogs. They should be ashamed of themselves, especially Dr. Hassinger, one of the owners. I had a $10,000 experience here. won t go into all the details here. Feel free to e-mail me and I will. Simply stated, my estimated costs finally were billed at THOUSANDS above. I had to pay the bill before I was allowed to take my dog home, and then he died 3 hours later. When I called and asked to speak with Dr. Hassinger to discuss all my concerns about extremely poor treatment received at this clinic, he refused to speak with me and filtered me through their admin manager. I even tried writing him a certified letter. Still refused to speak with me, but did send a response with an offer to lower my final bill amount AND an agreement to sign to dismiss them from all other claims. Are you kidding? It s ultimately all about money here. My credit card company agreed and refunded over $2500. UNETHICAL, IMMORAL AND SHAMEFUL! It s been a year since I have even been able to write this review, it was so painful. Shame on you, Dr. Hassinger and Northeast Veterinary! Do yourself a favor, and in an emergency, make the drive to the clinic in S. Abington. Stellar service and compassion there....world s apart from the treatment your beloved pet will receive here. btw, I have proof in writing from my credit card company of the $2,732.14 REFUNDED to me! Email me and I can provide proof and tell you more about all the lies and shortcomings. Northeast can TRY to tell a good story and it s a shame that it s left up to office staff to handle and not the doctors who are actually charged with the care of our beloved pets.]
