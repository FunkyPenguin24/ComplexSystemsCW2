[110384311186275198955,100371304212617304454,Outstanding customer service. Every time I go there, I leave very satisfied. Got an inspection done.. they walked right out and asked what I needed. The inspection took 10-15 minutes and another employee talked to me as I waited.. very personable people. He introduced himself and invited me back, letting me know of their services, prices, and online coupons. My car was parked toward the exit, so all i had to do was pull out into the street. Awesome place.. far better than the 10 minute sticker shop, who came out to disrespectfully read the small sign to me that said "we are out of stickers".. as well as 4-M Automotive who again disrespectfully said they were not doing inspections at 5:10pm when they closed at 5:30pm.. and when I pointed it out.. they said they stopped at 5:00pm.]
