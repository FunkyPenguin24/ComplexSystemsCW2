[102010227424405708385,100865801469716716216,I went to West Hills in March of 2012. All went well. For the most part. I have physically tried to re-enter West Hills, twice since then, and was sent home! I even spent a 3 hour assessment, the last time, and when the assessor call the doctor I was denied. I have all the insurance criteria. I was asking for help. I am sick of their TV commercials. Here in Reno, NV. All propoganda. Now I ask? Where do I get help? NOT with STEVE SHELL CEO]
