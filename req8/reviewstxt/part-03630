[104530515001922691555,100348405278668256717,When I dined here, I ordered a plate of Fettuccini Alfredo. It came with my choice of a free soup or salad. I opted for the side salad and was not disappointed. Their home-made Italian dressing was phenomenal. The fettuccini alfredo was also extremely delicious and consisted of all home made ingredients as well. The food and service here is top notch. This isn't your average pizza shop and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys quality food and service.]
