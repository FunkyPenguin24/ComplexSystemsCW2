[100896797545962045864,100953701545540107877,Didn't receive prompt service... Funny how I go in by myself and have to search for a salesperson as they're all talking amongst each other, yet a week later I came in with my fiance and couldn't walk 10 feet without stopped and asked how we could be helped. Anyways, found a couple bedrooms sets I was interested in and finally settled on one as it had a deal going on. I knew the furniture wasn't great quality by any means( savon isn't known for quality but realistic prices), so we head down to start the payment. Well being alone they wouldn't consider my fiancee income so I didn't make enough to be approved for their no interest plan. (6 piece bedroom set and 1 ottoman came to $1,100) so they had me talk to another person who had me fill out an application to be assessed by some outside company. Said I was approved for that, anyone would be. The plan was ridiculous. The interest was so outrageous over the course of 2 years( the minimum allowed) I would end up paying over $3,000. Should've known then and there. But we desperately needed furniture. Then I was told there was a problem, my furniture would take 2 weeks until I would receive it... Here I am 18 days later and I receive a letter from the financing company saying I was denied and I am unable to receive my furniture... AFTER I have already paid $350 down. Hoping I can get my $350 back without problem, but I guess we will find out tomorrow. One thing I am sure of is the fact that I will never return to this store for anything. You may as well just save the extra $300+ to get a better quality furniture at another store and save yourself the trouble.]
