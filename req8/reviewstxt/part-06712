[100728466010572583137,100517315893341815104,This Toys R Us is the same as all the others. I write this review because I avoided this Toys R Us for years because of its location. I usually drove out to Mississauga - which is significantly further but Google Maps said it was a shorter drive to this one from downtown. It was right. But I'm writing this mostly to point out that it has a surprisingly huge 2 level parking garage (that is free) making it easy to park. And there is a really nice park across the street. So, my wife and I took our son there to get some toys but then stayed for a few hours to enjoy the park across the street - all with free parking - which is rare in Toronto.]
