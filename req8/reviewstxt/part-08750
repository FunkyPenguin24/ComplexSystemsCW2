[104924488369500417846,100626037243633212141,This used to be one of my favorite places to go to dinner so I feel really bad writing this review. I had been going to Vince's for 20 years. For some reason, the past couple of years it has gone completely downhill. Service and the food had always been impeccable. You always had to wait awhile for your meal but it was always well worth it. I asked to go for my birthday in August this year and it was horrible. There were 4 of us and only 1 of us had A beer. We waited for an hour & a half and when the food arrived, all the pasta was overcooked & the sauce did not taste right. I ate 2 bites and that was it. My guests finished half of their dishes if that. The bill was $130.00. For not drinking & getting terrible food, that's a bit much. I realized was had at least 2 to 4 refills of sodas and they charged for each one, which is a bit ridiculous when you are spending that much on a meal. So, I decided maybe it was just an off night for Vince's & returned a few months later to try again to no avail. It was as bad, if not worse. I miss going there, I hope they read or hear what's going on there & fix the problem.... :(]
