[105321027806334272690,100626163838707680587,This place gives you no jokes about what they offer, it is exactly as it is in their name. Wait staff keeps you with your drink of choice, they have sushi (which is my wife's favorite), they have every kind of americanized favorite chinese food dishes (general tso's, fried rice, mongolian beef EVERYTHING), and it's not terribly priced since you can eat to your hearts content.]
