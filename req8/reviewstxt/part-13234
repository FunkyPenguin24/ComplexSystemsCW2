[108223114007010212883,100870259504911121673,I am shocked to see people who are supposedly trained to deal with tense situations react like this. The officers know he had a dog, because they watched him put it in the car. They should have been prepared. Why does it take three officers to put handcuffs on someone who has submitted to being handcuffed?]
