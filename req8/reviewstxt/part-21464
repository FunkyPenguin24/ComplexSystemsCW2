[105879283590414423599,100137851492859342190,I grew up in Cedarville, Ill. I have not been back since I joined the miltary and went off to war back in 1970. One fond memory as a boy was hanging out at the Mobile station with the mechanics. It was much like Mayberry, everyone new everyone and folks were just plain nice.]
