[110767012190680676396,100918658746852525453,Frankie listens to what I want, makes suggestions when I ask for it, and ultimately gives a great haircut every time. I've been going to her for several years and couldn't conceive of going to anyone else. She's personable, has a knowledge of both contemporary and traditional hairstyles, and very good at what she does. She has limited availability so you must make your appointment well in advance, but it's worth the wait!]
