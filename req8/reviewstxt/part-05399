[102647874504884815719,100446386517947153113,The staff are always lovely and generous, the place is basically just a shop front for the awesome ice cream with a great selection of deli items in the back. The ice cream is absolutely fantastic - the best I have had in London served in a cone and really only beaten by a few scoops I've had with other things at Michelin starred restaurants. So for Â£4 you really cannot go wrong. My favourite is the salted caramel and pecan, but I am a sucker for both those things. All the flavours I've tried have been great.]
