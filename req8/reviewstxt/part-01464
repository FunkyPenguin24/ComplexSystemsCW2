[118359497885908692960,100234802715620168482,I contacted Herman at the Leather Hospital to repair a leather jacket. He came up with a creative solution to me problem and the jacket looks perfect. No one will ever know there was a rip on my jacket. I dropped my jacket off at 5pm and Herman promosed it would be ready the next day. He called me at about 8pm to tell me it was fixed. The service was great and so was the crafsmanship.]
