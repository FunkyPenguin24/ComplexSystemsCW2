[114503531895010273903,100331812080511748329,We used AB Moving to move us out of our house into our temporary rental. Their 3 person team arrived on time, quickly loaded up our house and unloaded everything at the new place. We were truly impressed with the service and quality of the work. When our new house is ready, AB Moving will be the first thing that we schedule to not only get us out of our rental but to unload our storage shed. Nearly 4 months later, we are still impressed with their overall service -- from scheduling to the actual move and everything in between (most notably the one guy who carried a washing machine up 3 flights of stairs on his back).]
