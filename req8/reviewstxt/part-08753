[107180994776454117327,100626129157744307701,I strongly regret to ever go to Gina's. My boyfriend and I wanted to experience authentic mexican lunch/atmosphere. We arrived and were alerted by the cook sitting outside of the restaurant and not quite looking clean and professional, however, we decided to give it a shot anyways, Service was all right, however, the food was a real disappointment: not seasoned AT ALL, tasted and looked quite old. We left the place very unhappy about our 60$ lunch that totally did not worth it. The story does not end here. Few hours later, my boyfriend got very sick with his stomach and spend the whole night and the next day in pain and severe discomfort from food poisoning. If you really care about your health, dont go to Gina's! Well overpriced for getting food poisoning.]
