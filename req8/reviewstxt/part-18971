[110683134385429198917,100004549094084344287,I have been working with Language Direct since last year, as a freelance translator. As far as my experience with Language Direct is concerned, it is one of my most favorites translation job outsourcing companies. Their professional ethics and relation with the vendors and commitment to the value based business practices are commendable. I am totally satisfied with the company for its timely payment and flexibility of the deadline offered to me upon my request while executing some projects, on some occasion. In short, Language Direct is a reliable and trustworthy company providing translation and interpretation services in UK. I always look forward to the mails with new projects from Language Direct.]
