[114740339062426940087,100886741274159253258,We were completely disappointed to learn the character of the actual owners of this restaurant. The food was wonderful and our waitress was great at first, but the evening fell apart as we were ready to get our bill. It appeared management made a decision to pull the other waitress from the floor and left ours scrambling with three new tables to seat. We waited over 35 minutes post meal to get a check and personally had to chase it down. Not blaming the waitress, as she was great during our meal, but I addressed the issue kindly with the owner herself and what I received was blatant disregard for the experience. Her integrity was lacking in her indifference as well as her desire to throw her staff under the bus. She made no effort to acknowledge or apologize for the wait and dismissively turned her back on us. Unfortunately, as great as the food was, I donâ€™t want to support a business who so carelessly esteems their patrons]
