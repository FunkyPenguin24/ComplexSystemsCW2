[115011166917312763145,101157875286158389202,-Paintballing here is the cheapest around, and for the most part they have a great field. (The staff upkeep's the paintball equipment very well.) I would recommend paintballing here. -Go-karting here is decent, the course is great but choose wisely with the carts. some are slow as hell. -Mini-Golf here is decent, the course is a bit run down but it functions well. -Arcade here sucks dick, easiest way to put it. (half the machines are not working and the other half that do most of them eat tokens.) -The haunted walks here on Halloween are pretty cool too. For the most part I only come here for paintball with my cousins or haunted walk with friends. Maybe a couple cart rides but that's about it.]
