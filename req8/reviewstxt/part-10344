Our final waiter was great but our first was not as much and the hostess appeared very confused. We had to sit at the bar first because we arrived at 5:24 PM and seating didn't begin to 5:30 PM. When it came time to move to our seats, we moved ourselves and made a few trips to bring everything with us. We were surprised that none of the waitstaff came over to help bring over our drinks and menu.]
