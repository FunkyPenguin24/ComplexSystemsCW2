[115942564153717229842,100440084735557734704,Great hotel, amazing staff, decent location. If you need a place to crash for the night, or are looking to stay long term, this Marriott property is the place to go. I heard they even have an overnight person specifically to hold down furniture and distract drunk creepy guests. I think they allow cats, because I hear lots of meowing in the lobby area, but I have yet to confirm any actual felines.]
