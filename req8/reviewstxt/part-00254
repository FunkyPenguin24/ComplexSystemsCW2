[105574455486939487193,100172390990246176909,Quality/Appeal/Service: ATROCIOUS Beware: these people are scammers! Like thousands of other customers this "company" stole from me, lied to me, and are refusing to fulfil their side of the contract. WAE+ are *not* in the retail business - they are in the business of taking millions of pounds in interest free loans by deceiving people unlucky enough not to have researched this scam outfit before placing an order. They will take your money, then claim there is a delay caused by their suppliers (while their website keeps listing the items as "in stock"), and when you finally have enough you'll be lucky if you get a refund after 30 days or longer - if you get it at all. Just do a simple Google search on them. It’s really quite illuminating.﻿]
