[105576765441514689112,100606012516769160843,I used to have my hair cut by Joe Mills at The Lounge Soho. It took me a long time to find a men's hairdresser in London who could do a flat-top properly. Luckily, a friend recommended Joe. He's been cutting my hair for several years now, and I cannot recommend him highly enough. The staff at his Barber and Hairdressing salon, Joe and Co, are as polite and welcoming as their colleagues at The Lounge, and the Soho location makes it easy to reach. Excellent!]
