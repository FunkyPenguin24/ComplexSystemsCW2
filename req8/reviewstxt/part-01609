[104315787687642246199,100242286509430322890,I've only purchased iced coffee from here, but it is SO much better than Starbucks. I very much enjoy Starbucks, but this place is much better. The coffee is better quality, and it's quieter. I order iced coffee with sugar free vanilla and skim milk. For the iced coffee, they use ice cubes made of coffee (iced coffee cubes). Their process for iced coffee with vanilla: Pump the vanilla, add a little hot coffee to dissolve the vanilla, add iced coffee/ice cubes, add milk. The dissolving the vanilla part makes a BIG difference. Plus, you're getting about 30% more coffee than you do at Starbucks. Also, I like that it's a mom & pop shop - support the local economy!]
