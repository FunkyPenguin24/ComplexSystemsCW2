[115289710034390672778,100897222324270096628,There are two Arts Market locations in Toronto, and they both offer an amazing (and ever evolving) assortment of quality hand crafted items. One location is in Leslieville, and the other is just West of Ossington and College. Artists/craftspeople rent their space and get 100% of sales they've made. The Arts Market supports their vendors 100%, and I love that about them! Plus, the owner Daniel is one rad dude!]
