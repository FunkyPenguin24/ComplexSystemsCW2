[102556144198786096787,101009538605517828589,I got the pork loin dinner. It was really good. My girlfriend has a list of allergies, that were provided upon making my reservation, and I felt like they did not really try to cater to her or provide good recommendations. She is highly allergic to fish and the waiter tried to push a sale of swordfish on her. Water glass was never empty and I never felt like they were hovering. I spent $110 (including tip) for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. Fairly pricey in my book.]
