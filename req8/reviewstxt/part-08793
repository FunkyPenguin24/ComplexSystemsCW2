[112182617861257083686,100627385269683844148,The best Thai food I've ever had, and I've enjoyed Thai food in many places. The spring rolls, golden bags, and other appetizers must have been freshly made, the ingredients were recognizable and the flavours were fresh and meshed together well. The fish balls were salty, but the flavour was delicious, more fresh ingredients, and they were NOT rubbery. The mango salad was good, though they leave out the chili flakes by default, which was a surprise. The bass fillet with snow peas, asparagus, and bamboo was light and flaky, with a lovely sauce. And all the same prices paid at average restaurants! Extremely good value for the money.]
