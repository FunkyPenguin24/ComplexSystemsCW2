[103172469906780230667,100890021124341072508,It is one of only two places in Siliguri where you can play squash, and is significantly less expensive of the two. They charge â‚¹1,000 per head per month (with no annual subscriptions). They also have ample parking space, which is very convenient. However, the facilities and staff are terrible. They have one steel glass for everyone to drink water from. There's a missing curtain in the gallery above the squash court and you're blinded every time you look at it while playing. It's been that way for weeks now. The worst thing is the staff. Cheap, irritable and supremely uncaring about their guests and members. If, for any reason, you have to borrow gear from them, they behave like beggars about it. They're rude and will send you back without even giving you thirty minutes to play because their winter timing for Sunday was changed and you didn't remember that. The less you have to speak to them the better. But you get to play squash in Siliguri, and for that alone, it's worth the price and the harassment.]
