[103840788509290282677,101001676900168069921,I have been stranded in this small town for over a week now with my car in the shop. I was looking for a place on a Sunday to grab a brew and some hot food when I came across Mackey's. The food is very good with prices that match it's quality and they have a very friendly staff not to mention the Owners are on site a large portion of the time willing and able to make your visit more enjoyable. The beer...they have several on tap and more in bottles yet they may not care a large selection of imports, but they do have many from local brewery's. I advise anyone who comes through Ontario stop in and grab a bite and a cold one.]
