[107412026797216707643,100451380602149923666,I called Washington Natural Gas in Everett for new Gas Furnace replacement quote when my existing one was broken. They came over and recommended me a new 2 stage, variable speed Goodman gas furnace with a quote of 6392.00 USD. After 17% rebate the price went down to 5810.00 USD and they said that was the best proposal. I initially accepted that proposal because I did not know the price of the Goodman furnace. However, after checking out the furnace and full installation online ($1300 USD for the same model), I realized that I was ripped off by Everett Washington Natural Gas then I cancelled the offer.]
