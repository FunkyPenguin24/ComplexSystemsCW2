[110972109276982370821,101034504807682131769,This is the second time that I used Korey with AGS. I called him because our home is for sale and our garage doors made a lot of noise and were not closing properly. I had to leave to go to a meeting before he was done - I trust him so much that it did not bother me in the least to let him finish will I was gone and he closed everything when he was done. Now are garage doors (9 years old) are running like new! We will call him for any issues in our next home - super service!]
