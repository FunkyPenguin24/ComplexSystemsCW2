[110987170674881662703,100263900889298622480,I went in to see about having a tire repaired. They told me the tire was un-repairable, the screw was in the shoulder. I know that is un-repairable, and accepted that. The salesman then proceeded to tell me that my rear tires were almost bald, specifically "both are at 2/32 of wear". Tire wear is measured in tread depth, and 2/32 is when you should replace your tires. I immediately asked for a quote for 4, to replace the one with the screw, the two he said were bald, and match the 4th. 860 dollars, about right for the truck. I decided to wait and shop, just in case. When I got home I pulled out my own tread depth gauge, and measured. 7/32 and 8/32. What a difference. I understand trying to make a sale, but this man, Matt, purposefully lied to me regarding the safety of my vehicle to get me to spend money. I will never do business with someone that lies outright about the safety of my vehicle. That is putting dollars over honesty and truth, and this is not a company ANYONE should do business with. They don't care about your family's safety, they care about making the sale.]
