[101555737223850574139,100127226525010794981,It was 9:51 pm today when I entered the subway restaurant at 811 S. Mason. The guy at the counter told me they were closed even though the large sign at the door displayed Open. I left. Then I drove past this subway on Grandpark and wanted to try my luck even though the time was now 9:57 pm. To my surprise, the counter lady agreed to make a sandwich when I mentioned that there wa s still a minute left. Eddy, her helper promptly made the sandwich for me and I was in and out in less than 3 minutes. This is called ultimate customer service. Very pleased with them both. Employees like them need to be a acknowledged. I told them I will leave a feedback and here it is.]
