[100023822283010969876,100131816562682345079,All of the 4 and 5 star reviews make me really skeptical. I had high hopes for this place, but have been very disappointed both times I've eaten here. The restaurant itself has a great aesthetic and environment. The bar looks really cool and they really put a lot of work into making the entire restaurant feel rustic and clean. The food, however, is BLAND. There's no way around it. Nobody in my group enjoyed the food either time I've visited, so I'm shocked that all 9 reviews so far are 4 and 5 stars. What am I missing? The fries are soft and have no seasoning/flavor, the mac n cheese is bland, the cornbread is far too sweet, etc. I hate to be so negative, but I'm mainly hoping the owners make the necessary improvements to really become a staple southern/bbq restaurant that can last on NW 23rd. I think the ribs, chicken, pulled pork are fine, not great, but overall the food is very underwhelming at this point. This place has a TON of potential, which is why I gave them a second chance recently. Unfortunately, the food was just as mediocre as the first time. The quality of their menu pales in comparison to Screen Door; However, this restaurant is a lot closer to where I live, so I'm rooting for Southland to pick up their game!]
