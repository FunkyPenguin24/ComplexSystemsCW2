[100378409466506792398,101155107914783342896,My family and I had the most amazing three day weekend at Hansens Resort!!! Guilliam Nel and staff were beyond courteous and knew the meaning of hospitality. The tube experience down the well maintained snow hill with two tracks was exhilarating. Great family fun and the cabins were clean and comfortable. The location is also very close to down town. Thank you Guilliam and team for a wonderful experience. See you again this winter!]
