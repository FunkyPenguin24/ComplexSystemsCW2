I tried the Rittenhouse Rowzone classes after recommendations from my coworkers and a great Living Social deal. And now I'm back for more! Rowzone bootcamp classes combine rowing machine sets on the erg with weights and calisthenics. Each class I've been to has been different, based upon the instructor and the day. Usually it's a good mix of cardio and weights that keeps your heart rate up throughout the entire class. The room is well stocked with top of the line ergs, lots of weights, mats, towels and resistance bands. Every instructor I've had has been good - they're a great mix between motivational and form-focused. I'm not sure what the qualification is for being an instructor here, but it doesn't seem like everyone has been a rower. I rowed in college, though, and know that the form they teach in the class is spot on. All in all, a great workout and a very fun 45 minute sweatfest. Look out for Living Social deals to try it out, or get one of their beginner packages.]
