[102005764605025736245,100534506759913162094,I have purchased many $$$$ from this store and am treated with indifference every time. Recently I went to return a ball of yarn (for credit mind you) and was informed I was 2 days over the 30 day return policy! Every other yarn shop I know of, and I've been to many across North America, have at least a 90 day return policy. What happened to the days where ylys would put yarn on the back shelf for you til you had the money to come & pick it up? Also, any other store you buy something you can return it for your money back. Why do yarn shops get away with only giving a credit? Anyway...I had a credit at For Yarns Sake and decided to use it to get some yarn to make a sweater for my only granddaughter's tenth birthday. I came across the pattern afew years ago & was really excited to knit it. I purchased Rowan Cashsoft DK in 3 colors with purple being the main color. There have been so many slubs in the purple yarn that I am having to cut them out every few rows! I have so many knots & tie ends it embarrsses me to give as a gift. Not only that, but because I lost so much yardage with cutting all the slubs out, I ended up having to buy another ball! The shop owner didn't offer a discount or a "gee, I'm sorry". She did say she was going to send the rest of hers back of which I assume she will get reimbursed for. We knitters in the Portland Metro area are very fortunate to have many great yarn shops to choose from and I choose in the future to not shop at For Yarns Sake.]
