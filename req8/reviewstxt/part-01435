[100707980107429617022,100232768733899992460,it is really hard to understand why if a package is already taken to long to get to you why the post office is so uncooperative with it customers. I am already upset that it came through the regulate mail when it was supposed come 2 day mail. then you have to deal with those people who just don't seem to understand you all, or really just don't care. i truly believe it's the later. I'm just so upset with all the things about this shipment. but through it all Redford post office seems to be the worst that i have encounter by far. the rest seem to be trying to get me to the package. Redford is just open your business if you want your package.Never mind its only 8 days late already and that you have other things planned . and you don't normally take time away from work. But the first time you do that cannot work with you anyway. HOW SAD IT IS THAT THEY HAVE NO COMPASSION!!!!!!! FOR PEOPLE!!!!!!!!.]
