[107775522629042247350,101029606909604576112,After having HVAC problems and receiving wrong information from several other technicians, we began to look for a knowledgeable, honest and reasonable technician. We called Steve after reading several good reviews online. He came and assessed the situation. He thoroughly explained what we needed and why. He was prompt in his scheduling and came exactly on time. He was very professional and did excellent work in removing and replacing our old compressor and handler. Compared to other quotes received, his pricing was very competitive. We are happy to now have a dependable technician to call! We will definitely be passing his card along...Thanks Steve!]
