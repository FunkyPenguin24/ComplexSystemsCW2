[101254904212972582565,101007811006044157148,my experience here was severely less than well. the staff wasn't friendly and they didn't know how to find some hardware specifications on my computer I was trying to pawn. the shop manager took over the investigation and for at least an hour he sat there quiet and didn't say a word about the status of his finds. so after that hour we decide to leave because we weren't getting anywhere. So I tell the shop manager that we are going to leave and that they are taking too long. He replies " Well we are sorry we couldn't help you, but you didn't tell us the specifications of this computer and we can't pawn something you don't know about." Customer service is something they obviously don't know about. if you expect way less than customer service, go to Pawn X-Change on pacific avenue.]
