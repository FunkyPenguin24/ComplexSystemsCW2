[108597506174134946939,101092236669843183332,Bought a new ZX-14 at the Redondo Beach store. Had to get warrantee replacement of windshield (to the correct smoked black one). Kendall made this experience seamless. From her phone call for appointment to me riding home with new part, she guided the entire experience anticipating everything. Bruce in parts was also amazing in that I was unhappy with the mirrors (shape) on my Kawasaki. I bought my first Ninja in 1968 so experience I have. Bruce had retro to new ideas, catalogs and options on hand that had never occurred to me. He showed me mirrors from Italy that were more like jewelry than mirrors! It is a state-of-the-art pleasure to shop at Del Amo. Also while outside some mechanics were coming and going. I asked about chain lube and was given a virtual class on that and the spacing of my free 300 mile check-up. Everyone here is positive and very helpful]
