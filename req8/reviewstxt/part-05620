[107276769461235481537,100457327807013072913,I love this place. I've only recently gone to a plant based diet, so I enjoy eating lunch there occasionally. There's a wide selection of food on the bar and I've loved every dish. I haven't ordered from the menu, but have eaten from the bar three or four times. The store has a big selection of products for vegans, so I feel confident that I have an excellent source for the foods I need for my program. Keep up the good work!]
