[100349147014883320008,100641602281777734766,I have been to this location twice now in the past three months and have not been impressed. This past weekend I ordered the #9 in a pita pocket. At other D'Angelos restaurants that is a grilled veggie with melted cheese.....this one added "steak" if you can call it that. It tasted like overcooked shredded hamburger. I won't be visiting this location again. I live in bedford and will make the trip across the river to try another location.]
