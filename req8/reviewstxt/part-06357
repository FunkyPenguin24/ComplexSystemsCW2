[107325422198663821396,100495997998841298690,I have done neurofeedback consistently for 10 months and it's been a life-changing experience. In the beginning I went once per week and noticed slight shifts for each time. After about 15 times I went twice per month. Now I feel more at ease, not as anxious when obstacles arises and am more focused. I'd highly recommend it.]
