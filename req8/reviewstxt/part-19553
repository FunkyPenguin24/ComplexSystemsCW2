[106195187907021231391,100035771566965657234,TERRIBLE SERVICE, overpriced food, don't waste your time or money! We waited twice as long as they said, staff was rude and didn't care about doing their jobs. We had to ask for a server twice before anybody showed up to our table. Not worth it, there are so many better places to go downtown.]
