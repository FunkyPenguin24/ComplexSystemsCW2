[114827196091815763733,100320893642714919521,I didn't think I could ever have a pleasant experience at the dentist, but I am living proof that it does happen! He was very nice and explained everything to me before he did any work. Plus his nurse held a small camera on my mouth so I could see what was going on. It was amazing. I had another dentist tell me that I needed more that $8,000 dollars worth of work on my teeth, but Dr. Thomas told me I only needed a small portion of that work done. My boyfriend hadn't been to the dentist in over 10 years because he was afraid of what they'd find, but he went to Dr. Thomas and the only things he had were 3 small cavities. I'm so glad I found someone I can trust.]
