[107653071246496756740,100496476311062380333,The White Rose is overpriced. I received frankly the worst hair cut I have ever gotten and it cost me much more than it should have. On top of that, the receptionist never told me that they do not accept tips on credit cards and I was forced to return later in the day just to tip my stylist. The service was poor and I would not recommend it for haircuts.]
