[101926461883774400229,100121141113150528934,To Whom It May Concern: Our family has been under the car of Dr. James Donovan since 1985. He has provided stellar medical care and advice. DR D. has performed bunion surgeries on both of my feet. In my position I stand up to eight hours per day. Prior to the surgeries the pain was unbearable, since the surgeries I have been completely pain and scar free. In addition to being an outstanding podiatrist Dr. D is attentive, caring, a great listener and has a calming effect. I would strongly recommend others to take advantage of DR. Donovanâ€™s medical services Thank you doctor Donovan Cindy Coplan]
