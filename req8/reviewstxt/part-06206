[102123458912023946393,100487700563191884467,I completely disagree with the other person who reviewed. I thought the customer service was excellent. The person working was very polite and friendly with me, and I found my overall experience there to be very good. Having worked in retail, I can only suggest that the other reviewer may not have been very friendly him/herself and may have been annoying the worker with their attitude (because yes, employees have feelings and bad days too). I wish the store was a bit bigger and had more product, but it's a reasonable size considering that comics don't offer a lot of profit.]
