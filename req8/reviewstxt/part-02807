[101249351120448479864,100303427362518538402,I've experienced a ton of different burgers in my life, but none that can compare to the Bully Burger at Bel Campo....it just melts in your mouth Goes great with a side of beef talo fries. Other notables are the pulled pork sandwich, and warm root side dish.]
