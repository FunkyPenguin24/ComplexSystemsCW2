[116746348491049664163,100823451951029047996,Childcare network has been such a lifesaver for me! I love Mr. Simmons, he had my son potty trained in two weeks! Thank you to everyone here, the teachers are fantastic and so friendly. I get daily reports and activities my son does and they accept and love every child. My son has sensory processing disorder and they love him and care for him and all of his needs. They take him by the hand and help him through daily activities and frustrations. I love this place, thank you so much Childcare Network! I love the hours and the price! And most of all, you are fantastic Mr. Simmons, its been such a pleasure speaking with you and helping make my son feel comfortable in a scary world.]
