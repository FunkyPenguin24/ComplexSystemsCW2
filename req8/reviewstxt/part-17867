[117202453636584004001,101122658878795356982,My first time there and I got a beef brisket sandwich with two sides and a soda. At first I thought the price was high but it was worth it. Even though the portions look small, don't be fooled. They will fill you up! I'm a big boy. I eat a lot of food before I get full and I walked out of there feeling stuffed! The chili was good. The potato salad was good. The brisket was very good and the sauce on the brisket was great. (I will ask for extra sauce next time.) College ball on the TVs kicked up the atmosphere. I would prefer a sawdust-on-the-floor look-and-feel for a BBQ joint, but it was still good. The staff were very nice and fun to talk to. I will definitely be going back regularly.]
