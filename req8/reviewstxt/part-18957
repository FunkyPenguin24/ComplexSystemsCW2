[102914385738661712576,100003782261263720511,I've going to Cafe Shane for years and my experience just gets worse every time. The food is good but my last visit I waited almost 30 minutes after I sat down for anyone to walk over and acknowledge we've been sitting there. No water, no beverage just sitting there patiently waiting. I see one of the gentleman walk right past and give a couple waiting on line something to drink. I was appalled at this and eventually I said something. No sorry for the wait, no nothing. I ordered my food then waited almost an additional 40 minutes for this guy to even comes close enough for me to ask for another water. I had to ask to pay my bill before I walked out. Still no apology from anyone except the waitress who I met before but was not serving me that day. The time before that there was another waitress who took our order then forgot to put in one of the orders then asked if we still wanted it. Are you kidding me? As much as I love the food, that was probably my last time there.]
