[110057526982570452608,100791502269268313143,Even though we did not get our piercing done at Miss Heidi's, Lacey saw us anyway. She helped us clean up the mess the other piecing shop had made of my son's first piercing. She was very helpful to us and very professional. I highly recommend Lacey if you want to get a piercing done.]
