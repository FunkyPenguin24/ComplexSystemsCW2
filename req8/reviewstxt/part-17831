[107484125315572546758,101121357881122612439,My husband and I were headed up to Spokane area to take care of some business and we were also looking to head back home with a new Subaru Impreza. We had done our research and saw that Subaru of Spokane had 2013 Impreza's that fit our requirements in their lot. So we decided to give them a call a few days before we arrived in Spokane. At that time I spoke with Bill Keenan. He assured me that they had multiple Impreza's that fit my specifications and that he was looking forward to meeting me. The day before we went to the dealership I gave Bill a call to make sure they still had what I was looking for, once again he assured me that he did. So the next day we arrive at the dealership, met Bill and he shows of the lot of new cars. We were shocked to only find two Impreza's both nothing like what we wanted. Mainly they were manuals and we had made it clear we wanted an automatic. Upon realizing that the car we wanted was not there Bill decided to make some calls. Then, once again, he assured us that he had the car he told us about, but it was at the Costco across town. So we hopped in the car and headed for Costco, but low and behold 20 minutes later this Impreza was also a manual. So we all headed back to the dealership. Once we all got back, we were ready to leave. But then, out of no where, Bill tried to sell us a CrossTreck. We never wanted a CrossTreck. But Bill wanted us to have one. He wanted us to have one so bad that he started raising his voice when we said we did not want it. We ended up leaving very upset and stressed. I do not recommend this dealership. However, we did end up at Appleway Subaru and ended up taking home the Impreza that we wanted.]
