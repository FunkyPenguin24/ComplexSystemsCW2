[109040259330129321022,100898670871928659521,Steve at the Nimnicht GMC on Phillips Hwy in Jacksonville, Florida has been our routine person for my 2007 Saturn Outlook for years. He's awesome. :) I always forget to fill out the surveys and this time I realized I needed to do it. Whether its an oil change, or repairing my a/c that was an 800+ dollar pain! He always is friendly, fast, he rented me a car and I always get a gorgeous new one to rent :) Thanks Steve - you're the best! From Ronique and Garrick Gibson.. you make coming to get service done not as bad as people make it to be.]
