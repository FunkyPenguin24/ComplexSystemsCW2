[100589941389352573735,100417607511298039268,I had an excellent buying experience at Royal Gate. They went out of their way to help me and answer questions with no pressure, specifically Stan in new car sales. I took up a lot of their time haggling and looking for the perfect vehicle for me but they never made me feel like I was bugging them. In the end, they beat the bottom line prices from other Dodge dealers and won my business about two weeks ago. I have not had a "service experience" yet at Royal Gate, only "new sales experience" -- but I wanted to chime in and offer my favorable opinion. Go to Stan!]
