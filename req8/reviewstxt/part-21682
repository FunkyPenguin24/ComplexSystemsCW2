[103770709440398462123,100149884120048046641,This is a great place to go for all your repair needs. They can fix everything you need done, and they do it quickly too. I dropped my car off on Tuesday and it was done the next day after replacing a timing belt, water pump, rear shocks & struts, and fixing my exhaust header leak. That's a lot of work in a short amount of time. I definitely recommend taking your car here, especially if you are a Subaru owner like myself. They even wash your car after they are done working on it. The owner is a great guy and easy to talk to. He will explain everything to you with no BS. I will definitely be bringing my car to Foreign Auto Specialists again.]
