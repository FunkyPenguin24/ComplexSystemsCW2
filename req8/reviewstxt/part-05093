[104900045576083270032,100428393911325776488,I have been getting my haircut and the occasional shave here for the past four years - the barbers are great, the atmosphere relaxed, and the decor inviting. I have read reviews that say they have had poor experiences with the shaves and honestly think this is most likely due to their lack of experience with traditional wet shaves. Lets be honest, itâ€™s not for everyone.]
