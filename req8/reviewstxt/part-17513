[100577870323034775688,101104043740952903668,The Kameo Coffee Lounge, in St John Street, is lovely. It has a misleadingly small entry, but extends into a larger area and outside space, and we managed to fit the pram through the aisle with no real issue. And they certainly didn't mind. I saw them assist other mums to find a spot, and the cafe is very child friendly, with toys, colouring table and highchairs available. It's not posh, and probably some people won't LIKE the child-friendliness, but I sure do. The service is excellent â€“ efficient and genuinely friendly. Husband and I enjoyed a brunch breakfast meal which was well-priced, well-cooked and generously portioned. And the TEA! We ordered tea for two and we got china teapot with loose leaf tea, super hot, with a second jug of super hot water to top up with, and a generous jug of milk. Lovely! And very yummy. I unreservedly recommend this one, and will go back any time I'm in the CBD. Will have to take a coffee-drinker with me to see if the coffee is as nice as the tea :)]
