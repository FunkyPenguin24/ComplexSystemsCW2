[115531609557761396595,100828035963130433407,Walked in to buy a single item, a wireless keyboard. After waiting in line 15 minutes for one item I tossed it aside and left. Maybe, had the line had moved just one person, my experience may not have gotten to the point of anger; however, it did. I refuse to shop at further Best Buy or other large corporate stores that do not have a line intended on quick purchases. Best Buy and Microcenter are the worst in this matter, especially as they are electronics stores without modern technology. I don't know why I gave them a final shot this holiday season; I am certain that I will no longer shop in a Best Buy retail store again. Instead, I will shop everything through AMAZON in minutes, and even have it over-night shipped at a price well cheaper than the limited items Best Buy has in stock versus what they must order to the store in longer time than other online retailers. AMAZON, AMAZON, AMAZON; unless you enjoy dealing with the crowds and all of the under-staffed retail stores over the next month.]
