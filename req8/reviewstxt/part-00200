[102575201446183909814,100169696281543144279,I am so disappointed in this company. I signed a contract with them to service my A/C and heating. I paid them extra for a contract that according to them I would not have to pay for a call out. My A/C went out on Saturday, I called them repeated times, left a message of dyer concern. I had to go with another company and pay for the call out. They did eventually call me back the following Monday. I ended up having to go with another company AV Heating and Cooling. Which was a god send. The question is will Polcock refund me the money I have already paid them since they will not be servicing any of my equipment again. Their service contract is no good they do not do what they promise to do.]
