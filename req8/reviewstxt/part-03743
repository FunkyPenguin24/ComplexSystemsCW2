They have amazing meats and cheeses. They make their own bacon and pepperonis. They have this roast beef that is so good, I had just one bite of it and I wanted to swim in a vat of it. They also have - surprisingly - a cajun crab dip that is to die for. It's so delicious, with just the right amount of spice and meaty chunks of crab meat. It's perfection on a whole grain cracker. When I was there with my husband we also got some of their smoked cheddar. I made it later into a smoked chipotle macaroni and cheese...soooo good. No liquid smoke here folks. As soon as you step out of your car you will smell the hickory goodness. Check it out!]
