[117184444634701114267,101143373059692617465,I actually would like to review C&M Auto Body works, except the don't seem to want any business. I have limited time off from my work, so it was extremely frustrating when I called twice to get an estimate done on repairs needed on a Jeep Grand Cherokee, once on a weekend, once on a Monday (today) only to have been blown off by C &M both times. The previous Saturday call last week got a "too busy, can't help you now" response. Today the individual on the phone's from C&M biggest concern was where I lived, and when I stated west El Paso, he cuts me off and says he can't help me as they are "too busy" and he then suggests "I take my business elsewhere". So much for same day service they advertise on their website. Not sure what kind off business plan they have, but I guess "business" isn't part of it. My advice: take your money and your business elsewhere as C&M apparently doesn't need it or want it.]
