[107726132244219432881,100965677999969413407,My wife and I, usually will go to This Denny's Restaurant In Sawmill Drive in West haven Conneticut on sunday mornings...however, we visited a couple of times in the afternoon and the services ws a lot more to desired. The waitress never got the service at the table like before. We had to asked for utensils and compliments items like sugar and others. She kept forgetting things and I had to borrow from the next table. She never came by to ask if everything was ok. Another day we went and ask for coffee and cream( this time a different waitress) and she never brought the cream and we had to ask several times to another waitress. The floor is very dirty carpet should be replaced. Will try a different restaurant for now on.]
