[103530103761461462620,100820638429346184271,I have to agree with the overall consensus on here that Gunnies is often over-priced, and is always over-staffed with a bunch of counter-leaning arrogant morons who seem more concerned with shooting the bull with each other and the odd regular customer (who could stand to be a regular at Gunnies? I don't want to meet that person!) than with helping other customers or new shooters. Gunnies was also a HUGE price gouger during the last scare. Asking $1500 for a $700 M&P Sport. It'll be a cold day in hell before they get more of my business.]
