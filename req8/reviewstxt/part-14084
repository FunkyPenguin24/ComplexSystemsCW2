[111412816519121457742,100916177982923083345,I Walked in expecting crazy eBay prices like a lot of the other local stores. But was amazed by the amount of stuff and the low prices. I actually stood there talking with the guys for about 30 minutes as my wife and younger brother shopped. They even hooked me up with a controller for my Dreamcast for about $15 less than what everyone else wants. I will be returning very soon.]
