[104282592808248963062,100491953362631176529,If you are between Georgetown and Charleston on Hwy 17 Sewee Outpost is an experience that you do not want to miss. The food and beverage, gear selection and warm local hospitality and knowledge are a slice of the Lowcountry that make me wish I still lived nearby so I could visit more often. GREAT SPOT!]
