[102314041804900426846,100644190035055927313,We love this place for what it has to offer but really have a tough time swallowing the repeated Lies and shady behavior by some of the management. If only everything could be run by the maintenance department and not the condescending main office it would be perfect. If you are considering moving here, don't. If you still want to try your luck here, consider this, the rent and utilities are skyrocketing because of a bad deal between nafac and the way things were billed for the past four years. Carmel is forced to raise the rent to pay for it. The office staff will lie to your face about this situation but it is public record, look it up.]
