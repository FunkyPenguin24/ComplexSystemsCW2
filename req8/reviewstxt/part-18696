[109276475308246242119,101166373262384008043,Previous reviewers are a little harsh, and must have a bone to pick. I've been to this McDonald's more often than any other, and I rarely experience any problems. "Food" and "Decor" categories are worthless here... it's exactly the same food and decor as pretty much every McDonald's. Service is usually fine. I've had a few "not-so-fast" experiences, but they've never messed up my order once, I've always been waited on in the correct order when waiting in line at the counter, and I usually get my order within 3 minutes of ordering at the counter or drive-thru box (and yes, I often actually time it).]
