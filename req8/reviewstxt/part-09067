[103757667291399863512,100642260525017998762,I had a pending medical need (but not urgent) and was looking to maximize my insurance benefits for the year. I asked my dentist of 20 years, and Dr Kee was the referral. I couldn't have been happier. The staff was professional and the service was flawless. Dr. Kee is a great professional, I am glad to have found him.]
