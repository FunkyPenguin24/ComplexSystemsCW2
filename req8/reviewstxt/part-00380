[117603836601067520071,100179022520916898445,Took my girlfriend to Tropical Taco for some fish tacos. 4 fish tacos, beans and chips... about $30. It tasted okay. Then my girlfriend found a hair in her food. It was long and dark... kinda like the cook behind the window had. Normally I would eat the leftovers she doesn't eat because she is pretty skinny, but this time I decided not to.]
