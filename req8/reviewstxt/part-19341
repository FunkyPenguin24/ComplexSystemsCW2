[109482819933076742201,100025199466316818728,Recently we were in need of dietary help with our 8 year old rat terrier. I tried calling our veterinarian's office for advice and was directed to this store. Upon arriving I was shocked by the number of varieties of dog foods among the competing brands they stock. One of the young ladies who works there was most helpful and suggested I look at the protein content of each one, as to solve our dog's digestive issues a high protein formula was recommended by our vet. The one she helped me select was, while more than what I'm used to paying for dry dog food, one that was designed for sensitive stomachs and higher in protein. While a bit pricier than say a Wal-Mart or Target, they were both helpful and courteous. I would gladly suggest them to anyone.]
