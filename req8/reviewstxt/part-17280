[116040526581095240985,101091271965712266394,First time I have ever had flowers delivered from my children. The flowers were beautiful and my daughter stated that the bouquet was better than the one ordered. Over a week later and the bouquet is still beautiful, speaks wonders for the quality and freshness!! Flowers from my spouse from other florists show wear after 2-3 days!! Delivery was first thing in the am even though no extra early delivery fee was ordered. Very, very impressive!! Will call direct and order when we need flowers!! Thank you!!]
