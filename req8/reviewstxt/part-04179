[110636764301287904950,100380387217826170551,The wet spot rocks...for the people that complain about the employees, that is sad. HAVE THEM RING THE BELL so the next person available can help you. I have been shopping there for years and have never had a problem...all you have to do is ask... It's a small business, not a corporate giant. Best fish store I have ever been to. The tanks are super clean, the selection is amazing and the staff knows their stuff...I dare anyone to find a store that can match the selection and understanding of each and every fish in this store...disease free is also a must.]
