[115188541221641376983,101170435502127063463,I've been to this place a grand total of four times. Each time I leave telling myself I am never coming back. And yet I seem to find myself there at least once a year. The majority of reviewers have hit the nail right on the head. The store itself is worth checking out. An excellent selection of comics, action figures, some sports cards, a decent amount of video games and a small amount of dvds and records can be found. The previous comment about organization is correct. There seems to be some attempt at grouping, but if your hoping for some type of coherent filing system, go elsewhere. If you don't mind rummaging through piles of interesting crap, dig in! I've spent hours just wandering around the place and still felt like I didn't see everything. The big draw back is indeed the customer service. I am a very respectful person. During my visits, I always keep to myself and only bother the staff when I am paying or when I want something that they've locked in a case. You would think this would keep me relatively safe from their scorn. Wrong. The first time I stepped foot in the place they made some sideways comment about the shirt I was wearing. Didn't bother to greet me, simply cracked wise about my clothes. Whatever, I brushed it off. I'm sure he might be a decent person outside of the store, but at work, the owner is a jerk. No professionalism, not at all friendly and at times, downright abusive to customers. I agree with the previous comment about the other employees. While not abusive like the boss, it's pretty clear they don't give a rip. My advice, check this place out at least once, but unless you enjoy dealing with service that ranges from confrontational and abrasive on a bad day to dismissive on a good day, keep to yourself.]
