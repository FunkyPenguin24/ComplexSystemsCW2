[104580966402775128435,100447627156444658376,Go here if you 1) Don't speak english 2) Like paying twice the going rate 3) Generally hate your life This place is horrible. I paid $11 for a book of forever stamps when it should cost $8.80 each. That's a 25% markup! For what?! I also paid twice as much to mail a flat rate priority mail box. Again, why such a high markup? Lastly, the owner is SLOOOOW! Like Mongoloid child slow. Took about 15 minutes to ship one package.]
