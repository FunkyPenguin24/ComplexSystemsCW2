[111369658556317497481,100983855324691870515,This hotel has gone downhill. I have been coming here for 34 years. Hot water is turned off in the in room spa's from 11pm to 7am daily. The massage I had was OK, but my husbands was the worst he has ever had. Massuse was rude and refused to work on his lower back. My massage was mediocre at best. Save yourself a waste of time and money by getting a massage somewhere other than this resort. Also, I had a broken foot. They would not give me a room on ground level even though I checked in early on a Thursday! They did give me great service in the electric cart taking me to and from my massage. Too bad the massage was so poor. Happy Birthday to me, not a good way to spend $400 for a massage and room!]
