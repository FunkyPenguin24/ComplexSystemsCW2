[118122271902262814698,100644479839990636385,Got bumped from a flight, had to stay in Toronto an extra night....... Seemed nice upon first impression.... Extra inconvenience at the front desk, when i was informed i would have to give 100$ deposit. I had no money, and i don't have a credit card. I was under the impression it was all payed for. Had to go across town and borrow money. Very annoying. My room was very small, there was a light covering of dust on all surfaces, human hair in the blankets and the tub in the bathroom. Pubic hairs on the ceiling. Walls paper thin, heard doors opening/closing, talking, etc. all night. Absolutely no frills. 20$ for low end breakfast "buffet". Staff were nice enough, but they all had that "i wish i was anywhere else" look to them.]
