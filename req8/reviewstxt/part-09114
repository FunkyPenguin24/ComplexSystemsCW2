[117009628921161419643,100645251082378667287,I recently held a sold-out event at the Lyric for my job and then my wedding shortly after. The experience was absolutely fantastic. Jack Wollman, the Box Office Manager, made the process for both events more pleasant than I could have hoped for. I can't recommend this place highly enough! It was just as perfect for my 60-person wedding as for my 500+ person work event. The rates are fantastic, too, especially compared to other area venues. You can bring in any caterer, and the tables and chairs are all included. Two thumbs up for the Lyric!!!]
