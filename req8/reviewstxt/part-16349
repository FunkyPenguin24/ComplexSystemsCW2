[106359917648000770735,101039298256200489024,Apart from a 'nice' view the hotel room was tiny, the furniture looked 10 years old, was dirty and worn. The window was dirty, the room was drab, the service was virtually none existent and if there was some interchange with staff it was less then friendly. The Harbour View room cost over 300.- per night, did not include parking, or breakfast. The Pool, what a joke. It was filled with leaves, the towels were lying all over the pool area, there was no obvious place to get a fresh, clean towel from and there was no pool attendant... The Hotel has a 4.5 Star rating - REALLY! DON'T STAY THERE]
