[100280295747316002702,100441012920010578334,Where to start. I wanted an oil change and full inspection. What I got was a loosely reconnected alternator when the wrong tool was used for my oil filter, then a day later my Axel came away from my lsd. Turns out someone unbolted it (probably to check LSD fluid.) And didn't bolt it back on properly.. if at all. I cant believe I even got my car home. No euro car should ever be taken there. In then end they couldn't get my filter off so I didn't even get my oil change.]
