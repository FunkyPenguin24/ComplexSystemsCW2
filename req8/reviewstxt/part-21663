[103275150074379665292,100148603087477214905,Fast courteous service, nice staff, I was in and out in no time . They wasted no time giving me my check up and doing all the tests . They found I had a detached retina so I didn't get to pick out frames or anything, referred me to one of the best eye surgeons in the country so I'll be back when everything gets fixed. All in all a good experience.]
