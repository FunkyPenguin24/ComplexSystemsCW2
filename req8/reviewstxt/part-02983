[103650634091272890834,100313139129491785976,Stopped in on the way home from Dallas. Great chain restaurant to eat. I pretty well stay with the same plate each time I eat JC: Chicken Marsala. There was nothing particularly special about this one, but the waitress and other staff were very professional.]
