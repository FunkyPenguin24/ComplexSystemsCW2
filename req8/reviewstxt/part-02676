[100200751604404134668,100296774318677352637,Excellent job, highly recommended! Preston from Premo Construction recently did not one but two home inspections for me and both times he was extremely thorough, knowledgeable and professional. In addition to providing an excellent write up with photographs he also took the time to show us areas of concern and offer tips on how we could fix it ourselves. Preston took the time to answer all of our questions and helped make buying our first home less stressful.]
