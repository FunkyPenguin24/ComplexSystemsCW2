[104297068174092868797,100436282318376757638,I've eaten at La Mama's many times and each time the service and food are exactly what I expected. I'm from the US and my standard for service and food is high and they meet this expectation. The price is reasonable, considering I get dinner for 2, wine, desert and some sides for 82 ron, after tip close to 100. In USD this is $22 so very worth it for me.]
