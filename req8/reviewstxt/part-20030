[115963198219558891922,100061791593321707732,I've brought my two Akita for examinations, vaccinations and experienced no problems at all. I made my appointments personally rather than by phone for the place seems to be always busy... "Dr. G" (Giangola) was very attentive and helpful and went out of his way to help me financially because I am a disable aging veteran with a fix income. Last year He performed a successful surgery removing one of the testes with a tumor on my 12 yrs old Yoroshii, (the oldest of the Akita). Because of my poor financial situation he allowed me to pick up my dog the next day and gave me specific instruction to help its convalescence. Because I get discounts at The Best Pet Rx Pharmacy, Dr. G wrote me all the needed prescriptions for me to take to the pharmacy...The Place is small and crowded so I walk my dogs instead of waiting and when my turn comes they had called me on my cell to start heading them back. Rhonda is grouchy but I think is the overwork and the small area full of people that want to get her attention all at the same time. I can only speak for my experiences during the very few occasions I had visit the place and cannot make assessments about what others had experienced. However all in all I think Dr. G has helped many and tries to help as many as he can thus the overcrowding. I also consider him an excellent Veterinarian.]
