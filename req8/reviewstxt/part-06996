[109689897713798178848,100532536183561732908,Overall great experience, car had a tire pressure light on and no spare key but I got good deal and a lower payment. They were able to get me financing through a credit union too even though my credit isn't perfect and my own bank denied me! Thanks guys A+++++++]
