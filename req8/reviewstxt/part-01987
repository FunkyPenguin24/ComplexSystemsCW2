[100461673370840839116,100262063079394715660,Jason was a huge help when I got into my accident. A man ran a stop sign and put a big dent in the rear corner panel of my car. I work 50 hours a week so I had very little time to deal with this set back. Jason took care of all the logistics with the insurance company and took over so I didn't have to deal with them at all I would highly recommend mirror image to anyone looking for quality repairs / service]
