[106083089856890591268,100100230731978459493,Working at BodyWell has let me see first-hand the positive impact that care at BodyWell can have on an individual's life. People come to BodyWell with a wide range of problems, such as migraines, injuries, anxiety, back pain - even just to check on the health of their spine and nervous system. Since my first day working at BodyWell, I've been amazed at the change in people after just a short period of care - they're happier, have more energy, and have a better understanding of how their body functions and how to achieve the best of health. I've also experienced care first-hand at BodyWell. I've suffered with severe back pain for as long as I can remember, and have seen many doctors, physiotherapists and chiropractors, and not been given a clear answer as to what caused the pain or a long-term solution. After having my digital x-rays taken and explained to me at BodyWell, I was actually able to understand what was causing the pain. Now, having regular adjustments at BodyWell, I can feel such a difference in myself: my pain has massively decreased and I am able to do my job with a lot more ease and energy!]
