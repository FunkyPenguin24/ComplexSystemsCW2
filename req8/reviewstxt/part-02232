[107918548679875546238,100274440993958040803,Hi, i consulted the gyna of this hospital whose name is Divya..When i went to her she asked me to buy medicine from the hospital reception itself and not the chemist shop .I was surprised but we went ahead with it..we paid 3000 for just four pills and when i questioned the doctor whether these medicines are available in the chemist shop she said yes but different company..she then asked me to come to her clinic after two days which i refused as i doubted her ...When we came back home we saw INR 450 written on the pills..Mind you INR 450 was just for whole strips and she gave just 4 pills out of it...Ofocurse ! i am not going back to this hospital again especially to the gyna Divya who keeps promoting her outside clinic but as the bill was given by the hospital themselves for the medicines it clearly shows hospital is involved too..]
