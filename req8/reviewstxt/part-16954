[100388308970165881910,101072785361310493924,Although the service in the fan department was excellent the checkout process is wretched. They tried to upsell me on three things. If I wanted a MyLowes account I would do it myself but I have no interest in additional emails thank you and don't care to hear the clerk explain why I should get one. If I wanted a $10 one year service warranty on my $80 fan I would be an idiot. If I wanted to donate to a cause I will choose the cause myself. I quit shopping at Sears for this very reason. At least Lowes has express checkout lanes to avoid the hassles. Still, just let me check out please.]
