[114667014123430033069,101163729880481220432,I ordered my mother of grooms dress on Feb. 25, 2013 and the wedding is June 29, 2013 and I have yet to receive my dress. I have it pre-paid and even paid the extra money that it will cost to send to me, since I live in Florida. I will be doing my own alterations. They told me it would be in the 3rd week of May. When I called that week, they told me it would be delayed. SO I called the next week and again they told me it was going to be delayed about 2 weeks. I called the Company - Jordan Fashions itself and got them involved and they would not give me any information because they don't deal with customers, they deal with the stores directly. How lovely!! So until I get my dress, if I ever get my dress, I have to let you future brides, moms, bridesmaids know, that you can't believe what these girls are telling you. I have been told so many stories....I suppose, I should have just made my own dress and tell these high dollar fashion stores to stick it!!]
