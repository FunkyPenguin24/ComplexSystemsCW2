[111258782406510596618,100000328262218933119,As a Minnesota transplant, I've found that it is hard enough to try and find a new doctor for yourself, but trying to find a good Doctor for your pet is even harder. I went to Lake Harriet on a recommendation from a site like this and hoped that it was a good fit. I have never felt as taken care of in a doctors office as I felt my poor sick kitten was at their facility. They walked me through the entire process, and never left me wondering what was going on. I cannot recommend this place enough if you are looking for a great, safe, and clean place to take your little loved ones.]
