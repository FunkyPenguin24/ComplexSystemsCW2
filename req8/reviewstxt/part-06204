[101619625176948455526,100487566639326528498,I love this place. I always have. Their delicious Pizza is even better than 95% of the Pizza sold "down the road in" New York City. The Sandwiches are always fresh & delicious, and I swear they weigh about five lbs. each; unlike a place like 'Subway', where their Sandwiches are mostly made of (all) Bread. But there's also something else about Lodi Pizza that I love. That is, that some of the same people have owned and ran it-for what has to be at least the past 40 or so years-are still there. Mainly, the two Guys with the graying hair who (now) run Lodi Pizza, who are the Sons of the original Owners. I remember them when they were Kids, doing their Homework while they helped their Mom & Dad run this very special family business. There's something about that old School kind of tradition that goes far beyond how great their Pizza or Sandwiches are. It's a reminder of how no matter how much things change, that there are still a few things left in this world that never change. And one of those few things that never changed is Lodi Pizza. May it stay a part of Lodi forever. -Ronnie Giles]
