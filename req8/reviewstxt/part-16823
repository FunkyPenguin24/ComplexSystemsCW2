[101678814607874610021,101064859879161445891,Consistently the worst fast food service in town. It seems that the teenagers that can't hack it at McDonalds or Wendys get jobs here. Only reason to go here is if you are really craving a pretty good Reuben...and some attitude from a teenager who is upset you interupted their social time for their job.]
