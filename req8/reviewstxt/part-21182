[109064973808807553821,100122149598520953182,Bought my second bike from Victor Devine dealership today. A new CBR600F is simply fantastic. The service was brilliant, everyone was very helpful and made my day. The service department are top notch - installed all extras perfectly. Fitted new tyres for free as a gift. Every time I brought my old CBR125R for service or with any problem, the issues were resolved the same day. The longest I had to weight in the past was 3 days, when some part had to be delivered. Victor Devine dealership provide top class work. This is opinion from first hands, not "a friends' friend said in his wee blog". Will certainly come back and recommend to my friends.]
