[105165533407863116096,101013572750381734133,This is a shady establishment ran be even shadier people! They are rude inconsiderate and rip of their "customers" and the bands that play their venue! Its time for springfield to stand up and rid our city of shady local buisnesses like this! If you are a band and you play there Do So At Your Own Risk! If you are a customer there be prepared to be abused, degraded and over charged! Do not go to Nathan P Murphys there are planty of other great local venues such as Outland, Outland Ballroom and High Life, etc.]
