[114350029257517608506,100899433937526258868,Naruto is a Japanese-owned restaurant serving ramen and sushi rolls. The house miso ramen was perfectly peppery and umami goodness. Just in biz one year this is the place to take in ramen as it is meant to be. I second the earlier review for good value. Cheers.]
