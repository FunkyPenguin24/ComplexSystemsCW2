Interior is also always clean, not just picked up or de-cluttered but "just been mopped/scrubbed/washed down clean". The modern technology used for menu boards, as well as the flat screens featuring current events and news, along with the totally free high speed wifi make this our favorite one to go to when we're in town. The food has always been fast, fresh, and made rite to order. And the menu prices are significantly lower than the stores in our local area. I'd give 5 stars, however, as it is with all things in life, there's always room for improvement.]
