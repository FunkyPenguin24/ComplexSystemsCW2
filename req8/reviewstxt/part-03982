[108124751083872754125,100368441373988486507,My dog Kiowa loves boarding and doggy daycare at The Pawms!! All members of The Pawms staff are very friendly and helpful and truly care about making sure your pet feels at home while they are there. Kiowa has been to stay for several nights as well as just a short visit for daycare and he always has a blast!! The staff always makes you feel as though they care about your pets as much as you do - making it a point to familiarize themselves with your pet's personality and always remembering them by name. Other than just wanting to find a place where Kiowa feels at home, I also chose The Pawms over the other options because they offer competitive pricing for their boarding packages and daycare add-on AND they have larger runs than most competitors (4ft x 12ft compared to the average 4ft x 6ft or 6ft x 6ft). In short - Kiowa and I both highly recommend The Pawms!!]
