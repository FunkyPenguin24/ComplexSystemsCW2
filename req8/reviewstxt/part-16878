[110138628968719681275,101067854736682748556,Greater Raleigh Chiropractic & Rehab blends personalized physical therapy with top-notch chiropractic care in the same facility. Dr. Jeff and Heidi Roistacher are passionate, knowledgeable, and caring people. Dr. Jeff uses a mix of pro-adjuster and manual manipulation for his patients. I've been to a couple of different chiropractors, and Dr. Jeff's method has by far been the most effective for me. He is patient, explains everything, and takes a personal interest in my life. Heidi, the physical therapist, is one of the most personable people I've ever met - I've never had so much fun doing rehab before, and the results are clear: I've never had a bigger range of motion in my life than I do now thanks to Heidi's help. Bottom line: these guys are awesome! I've never seen physical therapy and chiropractic in the same place before, and it works very, very well.]
