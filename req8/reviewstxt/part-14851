[105543406209619927951,100959627418194391690,I originally purchased my 2011 GTI from Douglas and I've been back there ever since for service. My service consultant, Rick Szucs has always gone the extra mile and taken time to go over any questions and make sure any work performed was top notch. I looked around before I decided to get my car and people like Rick is why this is the only place I'll take my VW to now.]
