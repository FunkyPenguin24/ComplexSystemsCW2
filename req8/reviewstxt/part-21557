[102889048596478599925,100142731358907329601,My "go-to" for Livermore cabernets. John Evans does some really big cabernets, and his peach mignon is simply delightful. The Big White House offers a very deep tasting menu and the setting is truly unique. John's sister is an artist and many of her original paintings adorn the tasting room, including originals of some of the wine labels. If you go wine tasting in Livermore, put Big White House at the top of the list!]
