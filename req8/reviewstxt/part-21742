[115063721582544933287,100153204566361792605,We just got married at Sunstone Winery in Solvang. It is not the easiest venue to have a DJ but Scott managed to set up all of his equipment without any problems. Scott's equipment is top of the line !!! The dance floor and his DJ table looked absolutely amazing !!! Very professional. A challenge for Scott was that my husband and I are from different countries so Scott had to combine Croatian / Bosnian / American music. He did a great job mixing all the songs. He is great at feeling out the crowd and playing the songs that keep the party going. We were beyond happy Scott was our DJ /MC !!!]
