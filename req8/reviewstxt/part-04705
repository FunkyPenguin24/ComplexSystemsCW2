[106111421266643145108,100409332899522903134,We rented a 26' RV for ten days from this company. I cannot say enough about the service we received from this company. They were outstanding. We had a minor issue in the beginning and they compensated us well for the minor glitch (placed in the wrong RV overnight). They went above and beyond for us, we had no issues with the RV and it was very comfortable for three adults. I would rent again should we get another opportunity to visit Alaska.]
