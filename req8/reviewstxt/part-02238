[103055659444127288815,100274643781023172851,Terrible, I've had to go here several times as they do warranty repairs for many brands of small appliances and always incredibly rude service, especially from the old lady who seems to run things. We took a Kambrook vacuum in for repairs and they had it for three months, in the end the cost of repairs was higher than the quote and almost as much as a new vacuum. We were in the dark about the timeline for repairs and only got info by ringing them to be told abruptly that they would call when it was done. Will avoid buying Kambrook just to avoid ever going back.]
