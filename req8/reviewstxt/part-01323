[100366254623718830887,100227554345801663142,The Health Market is by far superior to other Hyvee's in the area, however, the produce department is extremely neglected as well as other departments. It is not uncommon to come across overly ripe produce, moldy breads, or expired products. Despite the few issues, this location remains my favorite thanks to the health market and friendly personnel.]
