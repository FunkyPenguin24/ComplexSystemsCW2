[102084532751214410508,100628941702681510529,Customer service is The Absolute worst I've seen. Tried callin in the order but the phone people seemed SO annoyed that I was calling them for an order I hung up. I went in to order for pick up, then ran a couple errands and was 5 mins past the time they said it would be ready When I went in to pick up. The woman manager (never got her name) Ignored me for 10 min while I was standing RIGHT in front of her. When I nearly Yelled at her to check my order because I was not going to stand there any longer waiting on her when I am the customer. "CHECK TO SEE IF MY FRIGGIN PIZZA IS DONE! NOW!!!" she looked down checked the ticket and Shoved the pizza across the counter at me. and VERY Sarcastically said "there ya go!"..... Ridiculous! What ever happened to customer service? Why Cant people just be nice and do their friggin JOB!?!? Geeeesh!]
