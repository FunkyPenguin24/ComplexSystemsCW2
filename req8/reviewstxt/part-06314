[103294195700597462110,100493247165472360542,Well where to begin? First the Folks there are great... A Team... My sales Rep was Justin Patrissi he was Outstanding. Covered all aspects of my deal handily and made the purchase fun... I like this in a dealership. Financing was more than I expected with a very competent staff Lead by Scott Brown. Brian Lolly is the internet Guru there and was very helpful when asked anything. As for personnal touches I found all my contacts with this dealership helpful and always preceded with a smile. Smiling is contagious there. My wife and I were extremely satisfied with all aspects of this sale. We love you Guys Semper Fi David And Sharon Bennett]
