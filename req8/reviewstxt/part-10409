[101895559159003882356,100715582130164146736,Located right across the street from Coca Cola Field, it's a perfect location for baseball fans attending Bisons games. Many craft beers on tap (try Curveball!) and the food was great. I really enjoyed my Mexican Burger, which is a little weird in an Irish Pub, but whatever. Prices were good, service was good, and the free WiFi is perfect for us visiting Canadians!]
