[116872028248851954230,100790770247459257441,This place has excellent ambiance and the BEST LATTES EVER!!! They have super comfy wingback leather chairs, a fireplace, tasteful decor, friendly staff - 5 stars all around. Their Turkesh Hazelnut Lattee is the best - a seasonal item, so it's not on the menu, but they can make it anytime!]
