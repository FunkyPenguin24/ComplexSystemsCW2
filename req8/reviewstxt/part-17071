[110757411239607938450,101079683441997746072,I had a very aweful experience at Aurus last nite...we were there for 'The Restaurant Week'. I had heard and read a lot about this restaurant and was naturally expecting something nice. The place is over rated because of the celeb activity...only saving grace being the sea front! The place looked dingy, under lit and dull. The staff was arrogant...not clear what their role was when it came to 'The Restaurant Week'. Personally, i go to check out the food more than the ambiance and I was very very disappointed with the food. Celebrity Chef eh? Food was under seasoned, tasteless and insipid. Chimicuri chicken....i was served 4 pcs of chicken fingers say about 4"long with two pcs of some vege...no seasoning whatsoever...the salmon cakes were stinky, so was the red snapper. The prawn served to me was under done, again no seasoning...and was again STINKY....only the fettuccine was edible. OMG how can you go wrong with the chicken roulade ???? it was so so bad....i am not kidding ...where was the chef? what was he doing? Are your NON celeb guests paying green leaves instead of money? what in the world were you thinking when you put your name on 'The Restaurant Week'?? Aurus is one over rated garage restaurant...with a blissful sea front...but sadly they really DO NOT KNOW... how to treat their guests...when you have a sea front sitting what are you people doing with all that cloth hanging over tables and toppling the glasses, lamps??? Cant you find out how to decorate such a deck? NEVER AGAIN.]
