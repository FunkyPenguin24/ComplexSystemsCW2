[113165262231861446502,100276303143088906586,This was my first Porsche purchase and I had a lot of questions. Phillip Marquis was my Porsche Sales ambassador and he did an amazing job answering my questions. He was knowledgeable, professional, and easy to work with. He was responsive to phone calls, texts, and e-mails. He usually would get back to me the very same day. The dealership is clean and the entire staff is professional and great to work. I will be coming back for my next Porsche purchase when I upgrade, and when I add a second Porsche to my german fleet of cars! Thanks, Leith Porsche and Phllip Marquis.]
