[107434270304071492584,100365855457703097472,My husband and I went to La Bella Italia on a whim because it was near our hotel. I was amazed how good the food was! Being from NYC, it's hard for me to find food I like in other parts of the country, but this place did not disappoint They had all kinds of pizzas with great crusts (which I happen to love). They had a nice beer selection (Peroni is one of my favorites), and the lasagna is great too. The only thing I had there that was bad was their lobster ravioli. It was obviouly not made there in the restaurant. It was tasteless and rubbery. Avoid at all cost. Otherwise I give it an overall very good plus rating.]
