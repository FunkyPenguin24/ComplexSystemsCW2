[101239709700359201953,100356799718815428352,Our son has been here for over a year now and we have nothing bad to say at all. We love think the staff is great and we LOVE that he comes home with art work every day and is always learning. We had to learn basic sign language to understand him after they taught him a bunch of the basic words. We have another child on the way and have already signed her up and can't wait for her to attend and learn. We have greatly enjoyed being a part of CHLC and look forward to many years with them]
