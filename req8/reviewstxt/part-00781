[109324257699837514304,100199590695047789843,I had an excellent experience at the Watertown Ford service center in Waltham, MA. I was heading off on vacation, so I brought my car in for a 40,000mi tune-up. While I was there, I mentioned that I was having an issue with noise in the front left tire. In addition to the tune-up and rotating my tires, they also diagnosed a problem (covered by my warranty) and fixed it that day, enabling me to drive the many miles on my vacation without incident. The service was fast and friendly, and because the problem they found was covered by my warranty, the bill was very reasonable. I'll be taking my car back there in the future.]
