[102281381005106507321,100378533933059799291,It is a shame to see the other reviews posted here. I went to this store and wanted to purchase a cellular phone. The sales person Stanley B was very informative and helpful. He explained how the equipment worked and how it would interact with my other equipment. I went in with very little information, but ended up learning so much and ended up with the exact equipment that I needed for my requirements. I have recommended this sales person to several of my friends and they all seem to report back the same type of experience with this sales person.]
