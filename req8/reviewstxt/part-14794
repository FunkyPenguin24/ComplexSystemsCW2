[111666310821931838583,100955752288833496608,This has got to be my Favorite Costco in the area. All of the staff is great and helpful even when the lines are long. I visit almost weekly. They recently have done some remodeling inside so now they have two walk in refrigerators (produce and dairy). The only down side like every other Costco is that it is usually crowded (anyone who shops at Costco knows this and that means that you know that your gonna be dealing with rude and aggressive shoppers). I can usually find what I am looking for and the staff has taken suggestions on items I have found at other locations.]
