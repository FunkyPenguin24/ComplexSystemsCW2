[101752102223901642647,101000609517975267312,This small restaurant is situated inside a kind of cave. The atmosphere is nice and the food is good but expensive. The menu is with dishes with not standard names that the waiter will explain you (once again this confirmed to be the sign of expensive restaurant). Some details are a bit dissonant in a restaurant from Tuscany: the fiorentina steak is from Argentina and the tagliata (sliced cuts of beef) from Ireland. The thick spaghetti with lard and parmesan turned out to be the poor copy of the spaghetti alla gricia served in Rome. They left the mouth a bit too greasy (sign of a not top quality lard). The telling sign were the cantucci with few almonds and raisins... The positive points came from those in the party that drunk wine: my companions were satisfied with it and staff correctly served wines in different glasses (and know well their business). -------- Menu Entree: Mixed plate of ham, cheese, bread with liver spread First Course Thick spaghetti with lard and parmesan Main Course: Pork stew with salad Dessert Cantucci (biscuits) -----------------------------------------]
