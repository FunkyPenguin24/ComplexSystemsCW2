[108455156358150525728,100337480620921821017,I was moving from Boulder to Gunbarrel (not a far move), and consulted a few moving companies. American Moving was one of the only companies that didn't audibly sigh when I mentioned the size of the move. Then, when they arrived for the quote, they were professional, on-time, clear with pricing, and left a physical estimate that I could use to compare other companies. The move was flawless. They took apart the furniture as well as some exercise equipment, and at the new house, reassembled it. I'd highly recommend American Moving to anyone.]
