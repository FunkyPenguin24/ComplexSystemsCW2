[113760977375353382481,100597554174886668761,I wrote one excellent review just yesterday about nice atmosphere and service in this Restaurant, but I will have to take back my excellent review about service part as one of the employes I knew named for 5 years whose named is Jakša, turned out to be not only with inappropriate attitude, but downright rude.. Since I am Connoisseur of good Cognacs, single Malt Whiskey and good coffee, I was ready to give them FREE advice for which I charge £120 per day to teach employes in restaurants, hotels and bars.. He rudely interrupted every word I tried to pass on saying he knows exactly what I wanted to say. He doesn't want to accept the suggestions because HE KNOWS I am wrong! Being waiter or cocktail bartender as I saw in the past does NOT make you expert in coffee making! Big headed and cooky only because I told him I can explain to them in 4 minutes how to make espresso or any other coffee taste great instead of bitter and acidly! Simple mistakes everyone makes because 99.99% of people are unaware of basic hygiene procedure which has to be followed to the letter every time you make new coffee. Dragiša Braunović - Bata]
