[103601329698366736895,100232638021775806638,I go to this wine merchant every chance I get. They have the best selection I have ever seen besides a nice selection of cheeses to with my wine. I also took a wine class here which was fantastic. The employees really seem to know their stuff whenever I have any questions. They also have a wine club you can subscribe to, but to me, their wines are a little pricey. This really is a nice place to visit and partake of a glass or two of wine.]
