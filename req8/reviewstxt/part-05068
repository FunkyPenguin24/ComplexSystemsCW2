[115330445345921530648,100427070168722002198,Imagine waking up every morning in pain, and sick to your stomach, with body aches, a stiff body, severe headaches, and extreme fatigue at age 29. That was me. The funny thing is I believed it was normal, that i was just getting old. I went to neurologists, opthamologists, general MD's, had blood work done, and found out it was all in my head. I thought it was just the menopause from having a hysterectomy when i was 24. My pain finally kept me awake one night, so I called Dr. Edgerton, and made an appointment the same day I called. THey were very accomadating, and caring, they truly wanted to help me. I went in filled out paperwork, paid $30 bucks for an xray (which was right across the street), brought them back to the office the same day as my appointment, and got treated that day. I had never seen a chiropractor before, and they knocked the first impression out of the park. Dr. Edgerton is very knowledgable, personable, and really cares about my health. NOt just my spine, and neck, but my nutrition, my home life. He treats the whole person, and strives to unlock the true potentional of your body's natural ability to heal! This care, and Dynamic Total Health has completely changed my view on being healthy, and has changed my life. I will never see another medical Dr. for as long as i can help it. The staff is awesome, the atmosphere is positive and comfortable. As I am a loving follower of Jesus, i also love the christian music choices on select days! EVerything about this place shouts positivity and true care. I recommend Dynamic Total Health to everyone i get my hands on. Truly a wonderful place!]
