[108915702936513840225,100662910591879689437,Onw of the worst I've been to. My husband and I went to go get drinks throuh the drive thru and the girl wouldn't even let me finish my order before she asked us what kind of drink. Apparently she must not been lostening cuz we gave her the order exact. My husband asked for his drink to be sweeten and she replied "um sir the drink is already sweeten". To top things off when we pulled up to the window only then did they start to make our drinks. I wouldn't recommend this location to anyone!]
