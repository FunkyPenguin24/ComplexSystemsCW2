[109012027090155851819,101116461832687248713,I had a great experience at Mystique Hair & Skin located in the Princeton Market Fair Mall on Route 1. I was able to schedule a same-day appointment for a men's haircut. The atmosphere is upscale, calm and comfortable. I was greeted warmly and efficiently by the front desk (interestingly, there were two staff members working the front desk). Tayler, my stylist, provide an excellent cut and was a great conversationalist to boot. You'll pay a little bit more than your standard strip mall commodity service, but you're worth it!]
