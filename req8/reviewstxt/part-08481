[116211723239808640938,100612765720634473676,I've been dinning here off and on for several years now, and I really love it. I love their breakfast the best. I always get the The Wild Fork Hash. Its the best in my opinion. They are always friendly, and nice. The food is amazing, and I come here as often as I can. I love the fact that's its in Utica Square!!! I would high recommend this place. The atmosphere is elegant, and the wall art is unique to view as you wait on your food or it makes great conversation starters. I've also been for happy and I liked their drinks as well, but The Wild Fork Hash is so good and filling. Its such a classy place in fashionable Utica Square!!!!]
