[101987403200357721874,100569942690561701710,By far the worst room we have ever lived in. Mould on the walls, wall paper full of watery stains and discoloration, and losing contact with the wall. Freezing cold tiny room and non-working radiator, constant cold draft through big window, the bathroom is so small that you have to sit sideways on the toilet. Ceiling height was about 195 cm. Location, facilities and service is OK, but in its current condition, it is NOT worthy of accommodation.]
