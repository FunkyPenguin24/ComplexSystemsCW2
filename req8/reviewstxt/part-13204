[101768270599852493601,100868154991136371466,My Sister and I are BOTH getting married. Only a few months apart from each other. We decided it would be easiest (for our Parents) if we dress shopped together. (picture 2 girls fighting over a dress....) Circle Park Bridal was the very first stop on our busy day of Bridal appointments. The women opened the shop with smiling faces and laughter, it was very welcoming for 2 brides that were a tad bit worried about finding the PERFECT dress. The shop is super cute!! decor/ design/ dress layout. The process of finding a dress was super easy! LOTS OF BEAUTIFUL DRESSES to choose from. We had so much fun trying on dress and coming out of our dressing rooms to show our Mother. Turns out we had very different tastes... so it was fun to see what sort of dress my sister would have on when we would come out of the dressing room. In the end, we BOTH found our dream dress!!! in only a 2 hour time frame. The ladies were so very helpful and polite! They really made each of us feel special in our own way, and gave us the wedding dress shopping experience we had always dreamed of. THANK YOU CIRCLE PARK BRIDAL!]
