[103770389618677488016,100932781450723717054,Their PR asked me as a client to spread a word about this company. Here it is: AVOID THAT FREAKY PLACE! Just avoid it, if you are someone who actually reads the lease. Their maintainance services are so poor that it takes 2-4 weeks for them to react to most of the basic requests. After that they try to fix everything using the screw driver and the tape only. If you warn them that something (a lock) is going to break in few weeks, they will wait until it will really happen and then they will consider an intervention. The office charged me few times without any aparent reason. After I complained, the fees were taken off. It seems to me that they hope for payments without questions. The office sometimes remains unlocked and unsupervised during the hours on weekends, so anyone can enter the space with the mail and with the personal folders of all the clients. They also leave the documents with the sensitive personal informations on their desks for hours. All that office is one huge chaos, where nobody know, what the others are doing. I'm glad to be gone.]
