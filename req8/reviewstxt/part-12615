[103306716523097880738,100834745416758684559,I went for brunch today with a group and it was a great experience for all. Four of us were first timers at Blue Hill, the other two repeat customers. I had the breakfast tostada and it was really good and really filling. I tasted the potato soup which was great as well. The table shared an order of Pumpkin Fritters at the end of the meal - yum! Still warm and accompanied by a dipping sauce - I definitely recommend them. The decor was beautiful - I love the blue & brown. I'm looking forward to returning soon to try out the rest of the menu.]
