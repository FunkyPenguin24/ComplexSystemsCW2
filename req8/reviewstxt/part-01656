[104733841946829987555,100244804039403403036,I've never felt so ridiculed in my life. I went there because I came up all of a sudden with a back problem that was causing extreme pain and I was unable to walk. They gave me all the super pain killer medicines but I was unable to move still. The P.A. (his name was Joel) ridiculed me and said "you should be able to walk now" and said there was no way the medicine wasn't helping when it really wasn't. Eventually, a nurse figured out to try a deflammatory steroid which helped me almost instantly and I left the hospital within an hour. I was there all night long from 10pm to 6am, and they didn't try that until 5am. It was a horrible experience and hopefully i'm not nearby if I ever need emergency services again.]
