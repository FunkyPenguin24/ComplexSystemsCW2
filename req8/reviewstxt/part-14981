[101333233716773356092,100965878444976445313,When my former optometrist started becoming prohibitively expensive, I found Blackstone by Yelp reviews. I have now been going for 3 years, and my experience with them has been excellent. They conduct extremely thorough exams, they explain everything and answer questions patiently. Dr. Fukunaga is terrific. They have a good selection of eyeglass frames at various prices, there is no pressure to buy expensive ones. The office staff is polite and helpful. I highly recommend them.]
