[117208929264256949452,100876891367364196745,My husband & I have been camping here since they opened in 1970. Our youngest daughter met her husband at Leelanau Pines. It is by far the nicest campgrounds we have ever visited. The kids love the lake, the creek, the playground, heyride, walking on the cool nature trails. It's 15 minutes from Lake Michigan, smack in the middle of Michigan wine country and best of all has NO MOSQUITOS!!! Best times to camp are early May until Mid June for a more open feeling and less campers. September & October are awesome, too. Summer is wonderful but crowded because everyone loves "The Pines".]
