[108873919749068044081,100140441791546650006,We have been going here for years. Always getting wonderful friendly service and the perfect menu of a range of food choices. Large plates and small bites to go with a wide selection of interesting and delicious wines. Their flights of wine are quite interesting and come on a small card identifying what you are drinking. We stopped in for a light meal and were once again amazed and how good the food was. A warm spinach salad with delicious bacon and a perfectly cooked egg. Crustinis with garlic and heirloom tomatoes and goat cheese. Tomatillo and avocado soup was so tasty and perfectly spiced. Don't judge this restaurant by one persons bad experience. We have been over a dozen times and it never disappoints. Tonight they were at the top of their game.]
