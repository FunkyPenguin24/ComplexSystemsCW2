[103533344645137965340,100010191409091050559,We hired nyc interior design to redesign our apartment on park ave. Erika was absolutely wonderful to work with and has fantastic taste. We were able to get some of our vintage furniture, which were tired of looking at but didn't want to sell, restored to work in the design and she found other pieces which matched perfectly. We have recommended her to several colleagues and will absolutely recommend her again.]
