[108509857777282918081,101070254599523948592,I had contacted Dyson's Help Line because my vacuum was acting up. I was told my closest service center was at A & E Vacuum. I dropped it off, they ordered a new motor for me and I picked it back up after a few days. About two weeks later, my vacuum was acting up so I called A & E on a Saturday and they told me to bring it back in. I arrived and the very nice couple looked at it right away. They found a pencil that was stuck in one of the tubes and was causing a block/buildup. I was prepared to have to pay some type of service fee but they assured me that they were happy to help at NO CHARGE!!. It didn't take long to fix but I don't know much of ANY store that will help you out without charging you something. After a very nice chat, they wished me a great weekend and I was on my way. I will DEFINITELY be heading back when it's time to get a new vacuum and will continue to tell others that are in need of a vacuum to head over to A & E Vacuum where they will get it cheaper than the big box stores. Thanks Phil & Joan!]
