[107492490536415269376,100533127382525471159,a really great casual place. Food is really good, especially chicken, they have a lot of dishes to offer. dessert tip: try the chocolate bouche, this is a 5-star one ! the price is of for what you get and if you eat outside, you have a great view on chapel hill and franklin street]
