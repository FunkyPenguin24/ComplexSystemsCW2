[100721458509591132529,100268008195255310770,I was dreading having to go to a car dealer after previous experiences but I needed something reliable, safe and affordable to drive. After talking with Gary Kazda, taking the Passat and Jetta for a test drive and working with all of the helpful, friendly people at Inver Grove Volkswagen I felt assured and comfortable with my buying decision. This was my first lease so Gary took the time to explain how a lease works by breaking down how many miles I could use on average and estimating how many miles I typically drive. He also compared the fuel efficiency of the VW models I test drove to the gas guzzler I was currently driving, showing me the money I'd be saving in fuel alone. That, a smooth financing experience and thorough explanation of all of the features of the Passat and Jetta by Gary, convinced me that I wanted to do business with Inver Grove Volkswagen now and in the future. Thank you Gary, Angela and everyone else for your help.]
