The rooms are a bit dark, but opening the privacy shades during the day resolved this issue. The rooms are clean. The Eel River Brewing Company Restaurant and Bar is directly across the parking lot and provides a 10% discount when you show them your room key. Rooms have simple amenities, but they are all well-kept and functional. Wireless Internet is available and works consistently well. This is definitely the place to stay when visiting Fortuna.]
