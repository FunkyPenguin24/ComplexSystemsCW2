[108763628675912708669,100619259729007824369,Arrived late 9.45 pm and I asked about getting food. The receptionist said you can get food from bar but neglected to say that the bar closes at 10pm. So I arrive at 10.02 to be told at the bar that they had stopped serving food that I should go back to the room and order. Lo and behold when I try to order food which is supposed to be available 24 hours the person at the other end of the phone tells me that much of the menu is no longer available and that the chef has gone for the night. On top of that I had to ask for additional light to be brought to the room as it was too dark to be able to read from together with a substandard worn mattress and you can bet it was a great time. However after complaining to the manager Steven he did appear to be quite responsive. Why oh why wait for a complaint before delivering a quality service is it too much to ask to expect a little hospitality. To their credit they did try to put things right. The laugh was they brought along another taller light which was no brighter than the previous one. If you plan on working in the rooms at night better to bring your miner's helmet you will need the extra light.]
