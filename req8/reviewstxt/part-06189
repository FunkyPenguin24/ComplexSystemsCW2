[105359868812394042425,100487041318875796688,Getting LASIK done with Dr Mazaheri was great. I was slightly nervous about the procedure going in, but it was done quickly and painlessly, and I went from being unable to read my alarm clock to vision that is 20/20, and might even end up better. The followups have also been quick, easy, and thorough. If you have ever wondered if LASIK is right for you, just go see Dr Mazaheri, and you will be scheduling the time off work (a Thursday and Friday) for the procedure before you know it.]
