[102107992197136217704,100278698984513455781,Terrible, terrible company who can't take care of their customers!! My friend bought a pre-owned car from them a few months ago, a 2011 make. Within these past few months she has had to take the car into their shop multiple times, and it keeps breaking down! They sold her a lemon! To top it off, they stranded her at her work! They came to her work and took the loaner car she had been using while her car was in the shop, and didn't leave her any vehicle to drive! I will never shop with them based on the terrible experience my friend has been having with them, and I recommend that no one else does either!]
