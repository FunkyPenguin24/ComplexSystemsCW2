[117180972883304646142,100889703237810468200,I started going here as part of a Groupon deal. Loved the energy these ladies have. They explained everything and were extremely patient and encouraging. I work up quite a sweat in the 45 minute classes than I did in a lot of other hour long circuit classes elsewhere. All the classes have different formats too, so you never get stuck with a boring routine. The facility itself is really unique and in a convenient location. Definitely recommend if you want better arms!!]
