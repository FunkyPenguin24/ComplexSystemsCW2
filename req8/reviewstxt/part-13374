[104042334465007022550,100877532628511820221,Well, I am in a tussle with the Service Department, which I will report on when concluded, but so far: these people must be under the corporate gun to NOT repair legitimate warranty items. Short story: my strut hood is cracked and making a tremendous in-cabin noise on rides. I took my 6 month old, 5000 mile car in, not knowing the problem and already mightily annoyed at the inconvenience. The service manager said that the car is damaged not defective, therefore, the repair is my responsibility. Well, we are 60 year old folks, and drive an Avalon, so you do the math adding this up. I say it is defective. Here is bottom line: -why would you alienate good, long-standing customers over a new car, knowing my access to all the social media, just to save a few hundred bucks? Is this good business? More on this later]
