[102583538642676543312,100619427311218465491,My 4yr old has gone to Starlight since they opened in the fall 2008. I have been very pleased. The Staff & Teachers are all very friendly and all know my family by name. They even help me with some of the behavioral problems that I was having with my son when his baby brother was born. Plus you can't beat their affordable pricing for care.]
