[104589267511559631091,100967145446459575593,The food is great. Someone said on here that the breakfast is the only good thing on the menu but I disagree. I always get their tangler burger and the kickin chicken sandwich and I love them. They have main street pies that are to die for. I became a regular there and was rewarded with a vip card to receive 10% of my orders. Truly amazed by the service and food because I wasn't a fan of the Perkins in Eau Clare.]
