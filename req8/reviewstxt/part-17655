[106108664557556620769,101111797868764820884,Dr. Andren and his staff (Jody,Stephaine, Rebecca, Heidi) All were super helpful and just lovely people. I am not an easy person to win over! The vibe was professional and very laid back. You could tell instantly that all of the staff love their jobs. They truly enjoy and want people to feel comfortable with their dental experience. I almost did not want to leave. They have local coffee and there is a TV on the ceiling. The office decor was streamlined and full of sunlight. The free teeth whitening for life is fantastic. I called around to several offices and the costs are very fair. I just can't say enough good about this office. I will have my better half and best friend switch over right away. Thanks again Peak Dental Health!]
