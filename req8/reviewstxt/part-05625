[101519674370321936976,100457594048870254794,All people in the office are very friendly. Typical wait time in the office lobby is short and the doctor tries to keep an appointment time. Dental equipment is modern. X-rays are shown on computer screen and the doctor clearly explains what problems are visible and possible procedures available to correct them. The doctor is not just an ordinary dentist. He is also a dental surgeon so there is no need to go to another office for extractions, implants, etc. Everything can be done in the same office. The doctor is an excellent surgeon; quick, precise, knowledgable. He is very nice and friendly person. The office is highly recommended.]
