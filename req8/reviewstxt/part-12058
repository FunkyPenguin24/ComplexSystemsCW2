[101375537597064064177,100804669144323645487,I love Ruth's Chris Restaurants. I have eaten at them all over the country. However, for the first time I went to the one in Buckhead on my Anniversary last Sunday and it was a very disappointing experience. First, I ordered my steak medium well. It came butterflied. I was never asked if I wantd it butterflied. I did not want it that way. Every Ruth's Chris I have been to I get the nice tall steak - medium well and it comes out perfect. They took it back and brought me back a new steak about half the height you see in their pictures. Even this one was not medium well. I had to ask them to take it back and cook it some more. Then we got the bill and I was billed for two steaks, the one that came first that they took back and the replacement. I will go backi to Ruth's Chris, but not the one in Buckhead on Peachtree.]
