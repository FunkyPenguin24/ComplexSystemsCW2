As a guy that always orders food and never cooks for himself, I can say that I've tried every pizza plays in Ballwin/Chesterfield and nothing, NOTHING comes close to Jet's pizza. Their signature Deep Dish pizza is like no other. The sauce, the cheese, the FRESH TOPPINGS, nothing is left out, and they're not skimpy with their toppings! Not only that, but the customization they offer for everything from breadsticks, calzones, pizzas, and even salads (yes, salads) is not your every day customization. You can choose from lite, regular, and double toppings (triple too!). You can do this for your sauces and cheeses as well. Oh, and you can also get your pizza well done (extra crispy), or litely baked (soft and doughy). You can't do that at most pizza places. The final point I'd like to make about my local Jet's restaurant is their staff. They are kind, friendly, patient, and personable! They ENJOY what they do! I mean who enjoys working at a pizza place?! Uhm, every employee I have ever seen at Jet's. I always write them funny messages on "special instructions" box during my checkout, and they ALWAYS respond with something funny or cute on the inside of my box. Not only do I get delicious food, I also get to smile. What more can you ask for? Try it, you won't be disappointed.]
