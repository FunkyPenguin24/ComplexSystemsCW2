[108057781120303790531,100549243670363917049,Me and My wife needed a vehicle and this was our first stop. She absolutely fell in love with this G6 which is the only reason I still purchased this vehicle. On the first test drive during braking I felt a vibration in the right front wheel. I told him to fix it and we will purchase it. Something like that can be a small thing like a rotor or tire out of balance. They told me it was the rotor, they put new front rotors on the vehicle, test driving I couldn't fell the vibrations as prominent. After two weeks we got a letter saying that we were denied the financing from the finance company. The dealership called and said it was our fault(I did have a repo with this company years ago) but the letter I got in the mail said that the paperwork took to long to process. The dealership told me it was because of the repo. Not certain which was which. So we went and resigned and the payments went up and apparently I was charged for a service contract worth 1495.00 - after I went to do taxes I found the fee for this service contract. When I called Bonham Chrysler they told me finance company put that charge on there and this had nothing to do with the dealership. So I called my finance company and they said the charges were third party not put on by them. They would send me a copy of it and will return the pro-rated amount. Every time I've dealt with Bonham Chrysler I've been lied to or misled by them please I urge you do not go to this dealership or pay for dealer add-ons make sure you know what the BANK said the interest rate was not what the dealership said the interest rate is. Do research and KNOW how this business works before you buy a new car... BTW I started selling cars 6 months after I bought mine. And learned how this industry works.]
