[100634044304153512146,100127787990574025627,This apartment complex is completely HORRID. Never have I lived in a place where they make you feel like you are not at home. I certainly think that paying $1000 a month for a studio means that you should provide the utmost service when necessary. Instead this location likes to milk you even more through ridiculous fees, like being charged $100 if you get locked out of your apartment after hours. Also, don't even think you could have friends spend the night without a penalty. There are about 5 visitor spots, per every two buildings, and if your friend is not in one of those parking spots then prepare to pay $400 the next day for them to get their car back because they will tow cars overnight, like creeps. To add on to this unforgettable disaster, I have breakfast with roaches because this place is infested. I regret moving out of my parents house, for this! I mean come on its Rancho!]
