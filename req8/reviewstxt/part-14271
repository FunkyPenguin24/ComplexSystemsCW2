[111006717643246963021,100926453132057015485,This being my first and only visit to this establishment... I really enjoyed the food it was excellent!! The only complaint that I have, is with the service.. The girl that started off the line asks me what I'm going to have, I tell her and, then she proceeds to walk over to help another girl who is working on the line just about 2-3 feet from her and helps her with something she was doing.. When she returns back to her spot in the line, she then begins to ask me for a second time what I would like to have that day... I tell her again, and by now my impatient taste buds are beckoning for substance... She starts to assemble my burrito but, while she is doing this she proceeds to start up a conversation with the girl next to her in the line( the same girl she had previously helped)... and, too my utter surprise this girl once again looks up at me and asks me for a third time, what I wanted before she completed the tortilla, brown rice, steak, and, wow, a scoop of beans!! The broad couldn't multitask at all, nor did she have the short term memory of a small rodent!! Sorry, but for a first time visit, with having not a single table available for me and my family to seat and eat our lunch at, and that is after a 10-15 minute wait standing in line, to have some young thing who obviously should have been a moved from her place in line to a more productive placement in the line for her would have been working that cash register!! Someone dropped the ball in Management!! I will return here to eat again because the food was amazing, I just will not be visiting this location!!]
