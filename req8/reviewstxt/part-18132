[102258526491726807097,101137608653136180205,I've ordered from this place a few times, pizza is great but the service just keeps getting worse. There has never been a time that I have gotten my pie in under an hour. Giordano's famous 45 min stuffed pizza honestly takes less time than their thin crust. I'm over it now, I've gotten my last cold pizza.]
