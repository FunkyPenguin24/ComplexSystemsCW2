[112491983559502088310,101128527035429727570,Really good midwest/Springfield-style Asian food with the thicker sauce over pan friend chicken (or pork). General Tso's is my favorite, and their crab rangoons are plump and tasty! China Garden is the only informal Chinese place I've eaten at since I discovered it last year. Nice portion sizes, inexpensive, very clean, and their front staff are professional and understand English so they get your order right. For what it is, there's really nothing that I don't like about this place.]
