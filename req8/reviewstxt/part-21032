[100433088092659670848,100114193748410502408,I go there every Sunday morning. I love the place. Its a little dinner with a great food. They just renovated a few things in the place so it's getting better looking but I think it adds to its appeal. Best breakfast for the value. I, my wife and child can eat for under $20 and actually be full when we leave.]
