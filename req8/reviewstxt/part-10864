[101433023011033768695,100740286936310595410,We had a very nice lunch here. The quality of the ingredients and food were very good the one slight let done is the menu is a bit of a greatest hits and there isn't much on there that you wouldn't get in most decent Italian restaurants. The building itself is fantastic and if you get a chance to see the vault room this is a must.]
