[102484610201152296487,100454080323734310675,I have been to a lot of congregations, and this is the friendliest congregation, I have ever been a part of, the leadership is sound, and has an open door policy, so if you need to talk, just tell them and you will usually sit down right then to talk. If you are looking for the truth to be preached in love, then this is the place. The Bible is preached with a book chapter and verse to back up what is said, in context but in a spirit of love, by Michael Grooms the pulpit minister.]
