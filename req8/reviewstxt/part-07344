[102860941150057646169,100551674200646063452,I called Rich from Auto Connections to install my subwoofer into my truck, not knowing that he operates well over 45 minutes away from where I live, he still drove out to the middle of nowhere to help me out. After arriving we both realized that the previous owner of the truck did a remarkably crappy job on practically all the wiring throughout the truck. Without a thought he jumped right in and started fixing the previous work that was done under the dash and installed the subwoofer. Rich really seemed like he knew exactly what he was doing at all times. It was quick and easy and I would definitely recommend him to anyone who needs work done on there cars. -Not Tim.]
