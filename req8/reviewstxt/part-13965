[102692808056159838158,100909505449732077911,I'm so glad a new Aldi grocery store came to this shopping center! It's a nice store with fresh produce/meat and bigger than other Aldis. The shopping center did a lot of cosmetic upgrades when that store opened, along w/ Aaron's next door. There is always plenty of parking (huge lot) and it is very well-lit. This used to be my 'go-to' center in it's heyday when Greetings & Readings was here, but now it is again with this grocer that's rarely found in B'More County. I do many of my errands right there - at the nail salon, bite to eat (about 4 small restaurants), dry cleaning, groceries and the all-important dollar store :)]
