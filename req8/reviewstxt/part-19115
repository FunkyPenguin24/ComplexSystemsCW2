[117792909038212904991,100011672244252037993,Sauce is bitter and lacks spice, probably just watered down paste. Greasy soggy dough tastes like chinese places smell. Ordered a "mini" as they did not serve slices. It really was "mini", not sure why they chose to cut the pancake sized mini into 6 pieces...each is about the size of my thumb, could eat with chopsticks. Have had better experiences with cafeteria andgas station pizzas. Based on sauce and bake quality would not expect much out of more complex "recipes" Counter staff said 8 minutes, took 22 minutes. Not acceptable when on a lunch break.]
