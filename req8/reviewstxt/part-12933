[116004299349496622928,100853450341967324929,My whole family has seen Dr. Patel, and we are all thrilled with her and the office staff. My children, husband, grandfather, and father in law, including myself,have all seen Dr. Patel for various things throughout the years and have nothing but good things to say. She made sure that every question was addressed and never felt rushed. I really appreciate that. I also liked that she can see all ages of my family from the kids to the grandparents. I recommend her to everyone I know. The staff is friendly and helpful which goes a long way with me.]
