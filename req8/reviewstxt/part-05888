[103281915954218354935,100471323240488692800,Wow - a rare (for me) 5 star review. My son has been taking guitar lessons at Rokk Skoool for over a year now and I have to say I am thoroughly pleased with his progress and with Rokk Skoool in general. The Guitar 101 classes were 12 weeks and got him off to a good start and I could see steady progress from week to week. Now he is in a Rokk Band and performs live every few weeks or so. I don't know of any other music instruction system that will give a beginning musician that kind of experience at any price. Rokk Skoool is a group instruction system that, to be honest, I was a bit skeptical about initially. But as time progressed I began to see the value in this method. Now that he is in a Rokk Band he practices weekly with his band learning new songs. I never imagined that my son, now 11 YO, would be performing live in such a short time. Eric (the owner/instructor) is a talented musician and capable instructor and it shows just how much he cares about his students. I can think of no better start for your budding Rock Star to get started.]
