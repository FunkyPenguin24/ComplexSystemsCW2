[105183627382771114610,100644928863424185264,I researched several schools before deciding on HAI. One of the things that stood out for me with HAI was that several people I had spoken to said, "The best massage I have ever received has been from and HAI graduate". That spoke volumes to me. I was immediately struck by the supportive nature of the office staff and directors at HAI during my interview and as a student. They are committed to not only teaching you how to be the best Massage Therapist you can be, but to assist you in meeting your goals as a student and as a graduate. The teaching quality of the instructors is excellent. I found the instructors to be sincere, knowledgeable and experienced. They make it their goal to not only instruct you on the materials but to impart thinking and problem solving from an 'outside the box' perspective to give your clients the most beneficial experience possible. I will always appreciate my time with HAI.]
