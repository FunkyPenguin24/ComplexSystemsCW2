[101348917599162313019,101011643468867756657,I can't recommend this facility enough! My daughter has learned so much since enrolling her. The playground is not huge but it is appropriate for the ages of the children. *They were great with helping potty train. *They work with parents financially through their Open Doors program. *Healthy meals and snacks *Family activities hosted by the center for the families and children. I LOVE THIS PLACE!]
