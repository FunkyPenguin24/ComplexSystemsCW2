[101593502825106189712,100317303879917168849,The professionalism of the staff is a highlight. I have lived in Atlantic Beach since 2002 off and on, this is my favorite restaurant to bring friends to when they come in from out of town. The bar atmosphere is enjoyable while waiting for a table (they're usually pretty booked), there's a nice waterfront porch out back as well. Big thumbs up!]
