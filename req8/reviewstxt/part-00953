[116613199389502227959,100208539600593556697,If you are looking for outdoor furniture, you must come here. I had been looking for months. I had searched online and visited several stores, and I just could not find what I was looking for. After seeing the commercials for Great Gatherings, I decided it was worth a trip. When I finally had an opportunity to go to the store, I misjudged the time and arrived at the store 15 minutes prior to closing. I met Keith, and explained that I realized the store was about to close, and would be happy to obtain a card and information on certain sets; I could come back at a later date. But he stayed late and took his time to show me around. He did not pressure me or rush me, and an hour after the store had closed, I made my purchase. Truly, excellent service, and the excellent service continued through the delivery of the furniture. Moreover, the furniture is exactly what I wanted. I could not have made a better choice!]
