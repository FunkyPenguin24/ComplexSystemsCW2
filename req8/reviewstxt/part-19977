[114797323272980776245,100058579858699430213,I run a real estate team in McKinney, Texas, and on 3 recent occasions, I have referred Stratum Foundation Repair to do an assessment for clients of mine. They took immediate action in contacting the homeowners to arrange for the appointment. One property did not actually need a foundation repair, but the other 2 did. So far, one installation has been complete and they did it within just a few days of providing the report and proposal. Everyone was thrilled with the experience, start to finish, from the initial contact through to the replacing dirt, grass, landscaping, etc. to a point where the yard looked immacuate afterwards! I look forward to seeing the next job done soon, and I will be more than happy and confident in referring Stratum to any future client.]
