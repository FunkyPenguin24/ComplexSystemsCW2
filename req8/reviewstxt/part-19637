[112463492006629688013,100040655537484842600,It's a typical US post office. I've had bad service and I've had swift service. It really depends on the day. Overall I give it a 5 / 10 because they are just like every other post office around. When it's busy, it takes forever, but that is to be expected. When it's not busy, I get in and out of there in less then 5 minutes. Sometimes the service workers can be chatty, which is nice when they are chatting to you, but annoying when you are waiting in line.]
