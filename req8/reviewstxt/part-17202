[106992947661865852369,101087276315221028265,Great location just a couple of miles from the dramatic coast at Crackington Haven. This is a charming cottage has accommodation for up to three but is best suited for couples. The cottage comes with a log-burning stove, and a free basket of logs - more wood can be purchased. The location is perfect just off the A39 giving good access to North Cornwall but far enough away to feel quiet and secluded. Linda and John made us feel very welcome with fresh milk in the fridge and a box of chocolate biscuits. We plan to return,]
