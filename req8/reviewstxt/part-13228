[116853014927780624933,100870122424315799113,What a pleasant suprise! I only stopped in for a brochure and drove off with a 2013 Edge. Alex B. was awesome, no pressure. Introduced himself, left me to check out the car and then asked if I had any questions, went for a test drive and I was sold. Now if all car dealers were like this they just might a loyal following of customers. I am a first time Ford owner, and I love the Edge, it's sassy! Thank you Alex. Irene Rochefort Westminster CA]
