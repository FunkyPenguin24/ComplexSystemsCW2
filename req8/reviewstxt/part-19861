[105049127897331476358,100052614455936939751,A "sure thing" if you want a pleasant meal in WHB. Great steaks, burgers, seafood, salads, soups, light fare. You can't help but find something you like. The outside tables are great for people watching and the interior is intimate - kind of an "Americana" feel to it. Not fancy or ritzy - you'll be fine in khakis and a polo shirt. Recommended but you may have to wait for a table at rush hour. Get your name on the list early.]
