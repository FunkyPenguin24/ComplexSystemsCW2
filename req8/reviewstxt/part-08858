[110032177514879383020,100630487064832958708,Been a member since '97. My favorite club by far. Bigger than Champlin and much larger pool, more free weights than Fridley, More machines than Maple Grove. Friendliest staff. They constantly clean the equipment. Not too crowded except 5 pm-7 pm so I just avoid that time. Large pool area. Staff is great up front.Just for fun, I try to leave without making the turnstyle noise to see if they still say "Have a great day", They still catch it at least half the time. Does that make me a nerd? Probably I see the same trainers & employees year to year. Being a business owner, the continuity says something about how the club is managed locally. Problems? I wish members would take a little more pride in putting weights away. I see Matt the trainer picking up and organizing weights between sessions. And there's one design flaw that's really minor. The hallway into the mens locker room is about 4 feet wide with a sharp 90 degree corner. There are about 100 near crashes every day coming through that corner.]
