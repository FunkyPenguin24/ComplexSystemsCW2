[102379659874495909484,100567568239385112308,These people left a huge pile of garbage in the lot after the Cannabis Cup with their banners and their booth still attached days later. They basically gathered their products up and just left a massive mess... They obviously don't care about their image or the image of the cannabis movement. I wouldn't support them on that basis alone. People who are in this industry solely for financial reasons don't deserve anyone's support.]
