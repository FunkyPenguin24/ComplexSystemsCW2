[112360426507253804230,100540307968348483713,Great golf course. Cheap, fun, and the people are great. Its not to hard for the learning golfer, bit its also good for the more experienced ones as well. It got a 2 because its still an inner city golf course, so you sacrifice a lot of beauty and solitude you would get at say, Bountiful Ridge.]
