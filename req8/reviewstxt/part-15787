[110783667594102895738,101009322090877971895,I was not actually scheduled for a service I was requesting, but they accepted my vehicle without any issues. They explained everything in detail in words I could understand, what was needed for my car and since I am not a vehicle technician that made it pretty cool. The customer lounge is always clean and plenty of water. Lastly, everyone was so helpful and respectful which made my visit very pleasant and I will be taking my vehicle for its 40K check-up at Mercedes Benz of Alexandria, I just enjoy the easy of getting in, receiving a text, and getting out.
