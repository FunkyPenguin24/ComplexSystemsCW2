[104321059087458057629,100605042921283927310,WOW...never in 20 years have I been threatened in a retail store! I went to Moab to meet up with a bunch of old friends from Aspen and do a some favorite rides and some of the new rides...I've been going to Moab for over 15 years. Naturally coming from the Bay Area I needed to rent a bike and decided to give Moab Cyclery a try as they had a 29'er I wanted to try. Having done the research I understood they are more expensive than the other bike shops like Poison Spider, Chile Pepper bike Shop, Rim Cyclery and Uranium Bicycles all of which I have rented from before. So I rented the 29'er for two days and also organized a shuttle from Moab Cyclery for my 8 pals at $160 for the shuttle and $150 for the bike. On the last day of riding I called into the store ahead of time to let them know I would be a bit late witht he bike. I returned the bike 30 mins late and was told that their late charge is $30 to which I responded, 'that is a little harsh don't you think, given how much business I have brought your way?' Without any warning, the next thing I knew one of the mechanics (who had previously been friendly enough - dark hairy bearded guy) appeared brandishing a seat on top of a seat post in a threatening way to intimidate me into paying over the $30, which I did. I hadn't been aggressive or threatening in anyway, otherwise I would have expected it, but certainly felt like I was being threatened and intimidated into paying. I would imagine that they are 'jaded' because it is close to the end of the season there, but there is no excuse for what they did. I have been in retail for over 20 years and have never seen the strong arming that I experienced at Moab Cyclery. Make sure you carry a weapon, cos next time I will be!!]
