[110712388758746505037,100159275251821436758,This person is the reason I fear dentist. The bedside manor is atrocious. He under medicated me before the initial procedure. I am over 250 pounds, small amounts of pain relievers and or sedatives will not work due to my size but yet I still trusted his judgment at this point. I attempted to tell him that I could still feel a large amount of pain and that I do not think the pills given had worked. He then gave me a rude remark and with a scowl on his face. As he injected the Novocain he repeatedly stabbed my palate causing severe pain right before he began the procedure. I am in my 30 and have a high pain tolerance but this is the first time a dentist, purposely or not, had made me cry. I now fear any and all dentist. This man should not be allowed to treat patients this way even if he is the only dentist who works on the weekends.]
