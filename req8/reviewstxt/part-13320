[116023839375431901120,100874936538583266141,My husband has been going to this office for years. My insurance changed, so upon my husbands recommendation I visited as well. I am very pleased with my experience. I opted for the newer, more expensive technology and did not have to have my eyes dilated, yeah! They were also very understanding of a parent bringing their children for the appointment and made accommodations for them: water for the coughing child and goodie bags while the children waited. I will be back next year!]
