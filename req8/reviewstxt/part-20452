[100187997118329450920,100083777534265762393,Why aren't ALL doctors like this guy? Like the other reviewer, I have no insurance but to make matters worse, I have no job. Just a small pension. I put off going to a doctor for six months after some kind of object got embedded in my eye causing blurred vision. "No money, Too expensive" was my excuse. I finally broke down and went. In the chair in 10 minutes, 10 minutes later the object had been removed and I'm out a lousy $170. They had to repeat that to me a couple of times. I fired a cardiologist because he charged me $560 for 30 seconds of his time. This guy was poking around in my eye for five minutes and only charged me $170. I almost can't wait for something else to fly into my eye so I can go back and see this guy and NOT get ripped off. You got a vision problem and don't go see these guys, you are nuts.]
