[106422896039129320155,100330666333239499962,The Duke Gardens are gorgeous all the time. I last went in January and was thrilled to see the winter colors. I admired the beautiful and lush winter vegetables. I enjoyed visiting the chickens; they are fun to watch any day. When I need to be rejuvenated, I go there. I can rely on filling my spirit with peace and joy as I am awe-struck by the Gardens' beauty.]
