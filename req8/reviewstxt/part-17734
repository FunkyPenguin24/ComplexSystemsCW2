[107715506239167245112,101116018551913499104,I now travel to Southampton or London for flights to avoid starting my holiday in a foul mood!! This airport is an embarrassment to local people when overseas travellers use it and are subject to the extortionate and compulsory carparking fees, a petty penny pinching charge for security plastic bags to put your makeup in, disgusting and extortionately priced food in a restaurant that's as inspiring as a transport cafe! Get your act together - please!]
