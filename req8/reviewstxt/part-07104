[110767464893112615463,100537824718317510581,The people at Al Lamb's Honda treat you like kings when they want you to purchase a bike from them. However, after the sale, you really don't exist. I purchased a bike 2 months ago and I still haven't received my license plate and my temporary tag has expired. Called them several times inquiring about the license and I get the same response each time. The response is "give me your name and I will put your name on the list and someone will call you back". Well my name should be on that list several times by now and still no return call. I finally asked to speak to the manager and he gives me some excuse about the person responsible for the the tags was on vacation. I heard that same story for 3 weeks. Then he told me that they are just now processing registrations again (as if to say it was because of the government shut down) and I don't believe federal workers are processing registrations for the state of Texas. I definitely won't be a repeat customer at Al Lamb's Honda. I get my license plates from other dealers within 2 to 3 weeks, not sure why they can't get things to the state in a timely manner. I checked my VIN number on the TXDOT website and it doesn't even appear. So I don't even think they filed my paperwork yet. I've sent a complaint letter to the folks at TXDOT, we'll see how it goes. In the meantime, not license plate for my bike.]
