[115332983195167333794,100259223040186121440,I have been at Central Christian for quite a while now, and have always loved it. Sure, there might be drama, but that's at every school. All of the teachers are excellent! I have enjoyed different things about each of them. I especially enjoy the fall and spring retreats that the junior and senior high go on every year. Also, the chapel speakers are always great. I have made so many memories that will last a lifetime. I would highly recommend this school.]
