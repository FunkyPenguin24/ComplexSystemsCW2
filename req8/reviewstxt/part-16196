[105596110317882059624,101031489711558227472,Rick and Malinda were so helpful and friendly that buying window coverings from Budget Blinds of Northeast Texas was fun! There are lots of options and styles to choose from...I started off thinking I wanted plantation shutters like my neighbors, but chose wood blinds with tapes. I just love them! The delivery and installation were fast too. I would highly recommend them.]
