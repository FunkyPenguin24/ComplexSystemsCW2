[100763919780322774702,100853211084185276829,We went here a couple weeks ago and were somewhat disappointed. The atmosphere and decor was great! But the food left much to be desired. My burrito was soggy and the onion rings were tough/flavorless. I hope that they can fix the food because the place has a ton of potential!]
