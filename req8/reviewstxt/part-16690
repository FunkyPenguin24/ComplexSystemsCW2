[104449832668248891371,101058345252598162722,I was at Zimmerman Bowl last Sunday, July 15, 2012. I was there with a group of 7 adults, and 5 children. It wasn't that busy. We had a great server who kept coming over and making sure we had everything and to make sure we were satisfied with everything. We had ordered french fries, 3 pizzas, which were delicious and HOT, and a couple pitchers of soda. The server could have brought the check for the food a bit more promptly, but considering he had already done so much it wasn't too big of a deal. The only reason I gave the Atmosphere a 2 was because they played too much John Mayer. lol. But I guess if our group wanted to listen to different music we could have put money into the Jukebox, right? I'm planning on going again in the next couple of days :)]
