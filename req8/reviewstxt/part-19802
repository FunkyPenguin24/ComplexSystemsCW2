[110211913620645866510,100049748135954512427,My family and I went on this trip on our visit to Naples and we LOVED it! Such an amazing experience. Anyone would enjoy it! The manatees rolled over for us and came right up to the boat! I've always wanted to go on a manatee tour, so I obviously enjoyed it, but my uncle was not looking forward to this trip, and I think he ended up having just as much fun as me! We had Captain Andrew Jr as our tour guide and I have to say he had a lot of interesting facts about the manatee's, that even I didn't know (and that's coming from a girl who has loved these animals since birth!). He was very entertaining and a great guide. I would go it again in a heartbeat!]
