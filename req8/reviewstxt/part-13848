[102867091624502233878,100902711002873026903,**WARNING** My wife and 8year old son and I have lived here for about a year and feel like the rules/management here at the Crossing Apartment are very similar to collage dorm rules. Here are a list of bullet points of reasons below. 1st. The staff comes in to our apartment without us home to inspect our living space. It makes us very uncomfortable because of the valuables that we own. As some of the staff here look very sketchy! Staff should not be allowed in a tenants rented living space without permission form tenant each and every time. And an appointment would be good as well. The last time they came in my wife was asleep when they opened our bedroom door. Good thing she was decent. 2nd. There are no BBQ's allowed on the patio. We where not aware of this when we moved in so we had to rent a storage unit to store it away. 3rd. If you receive a package via UPS or FedEx or a package that does not fit in your mail box you must pick it up with in 4 day or they will return to sender. What if you are on vacation??? 4th. They fixed the ceiling on the patio when we where not home...and left a huge mess for us to clean up. There was debris everywhere! SEE PICTURES BELOW! 5th. Once you sign the lease you will be treated very second class. Almost like oh they are "locked in to the lease" so we don't have to treat them like valued residents any longer. Word to the wise don't bite the hand that feeds you! Or you will loose it.]
