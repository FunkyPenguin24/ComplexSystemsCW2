[110669447631372408237,100835924179738834028,This is the only 24 hour CVS in my area so this is my "home" CVS. I love CVS as a store but this particular location is one of the messiest stores I have ever been to. They often do not have the store tagged with the current sales until Monday or Tuesday. The photo counter is a HUGE mess stacked with boxes and trash. I wish this location would get some better management that would take care of this place....it has a lot of potential.]
