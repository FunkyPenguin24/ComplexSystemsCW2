[101120131434300695708,100264136955160348820,I work in Biltmore Park and always have yummy meals from BT's! Surprisingly, though, what puts them over the top is the customer service. I was in a hurry on my way out one day and accidentally spilled my fries. One of the girls that was working saw me do it and got me a to-go box with extra fries. Then today I went over to get a chicken sandwich and almost left because the line was so long and I only have a half hour lunch break. The manager caught me leaving and said "The line moves fast, don't worry..." I told him that unfortunately I only had a half hour lunch and I didn't think I had time to wait, so he went behind the desk and put my order in. I got to enjoy my meal and had 10 mins left over to relax before having to go back to work. They take care of there locals! :)]
