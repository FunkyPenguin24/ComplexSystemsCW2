[111501166169785255897,100289066798145477693,Dr Kaiser is a highly recommended, extraordinary doctor and person. My husband had a sudden eye issue over the weekend. We were referred to Dr Kaiser by our Optometrist, Dr Frank Boone on Sunday afternoon. Dr Kaiser meet us at the office on short notice and after a thorough exam he discovered an issue which could have quickly become serious. He thoroughly explained the problem, the recommended treatment and at 8:30 pm on a Sunday evening we were on our way home with treatment completed and a more serious condition averted. Without the care, concern, and dedication of Dr. Boone and Dr. Kaiser, the outcome could have been very different--especially if we had been forced to wait until office hours on Monday for evaluation and treatment. We are extremely thankful and grateful for the care received.]
