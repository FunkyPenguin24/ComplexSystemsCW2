[103034962578272483277,100094273854610212739,Great shop to get some custom work. If you can think of it Turk can draw it and, more importantly, tattoo it. This guy is the tattoo getters tattoo artist. He knows how to make the experience a great one and walk out with some killer art. He know getting a tattoo is not the most comfy of experiences, so he gets some quality done in a timely manner. I came to him with a concept and he came up with a few drawings. We hybrided 2 together went from there. I even had him change a few things to get it perfect. He was more than willing to accommodate and make it truly a one of a kind piece of art on my canvas (me). Did the tattoo exactly as I wanted it. Could not be happier!]
