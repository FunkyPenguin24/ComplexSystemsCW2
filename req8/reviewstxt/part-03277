[103326728818858337186,100328251725253037803,My wife and I ended up at David's on a whim. We were out for an anniversary dinner and it couldn't have been better. The server was great, the food was amazing and the atmosphere was modern and relaxing. Can't wait to go back. Thanks for the perfect evening.]
