[106953135058556908783,100552808745800636791,We recently had a wonderful weekend at Magic Mountain. The unit we stayed in (D27) had recently been renovated and was in fabulous condition. It had plenty of everything in the kitchen and was very clean. The view for the balcony was spectacular and you could see for the ocean in front around through the Surfers Paradise skyline (really good at night) to the sunset over the range. It has obviously had some money spent on the unit recently. Great place, we will be back, soon.]
