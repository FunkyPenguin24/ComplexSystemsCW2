[114601773065989073017,100883440679117879557,I've been going to Direct Optical for over 10 years and always have a good experience. The prices are the best as well. One year when my insurance was no longer in their network I went somewhere else and ended up paying even more for the same contacts than if I'd just gone their out of network route. When my toddler twisted my old glasses, bought years prior, they bent them back no charge the same day. One time when my contact supply was going to be slightly delayed in arriving they gave me 3 months worth extra for free. I just got back from my appt. today and it was super quick & pleasant and despite me arriving 5 minutes late I had not wait. The staff was friendly & welcoming and charmed my shy 4yr old too. I was even given a rebate and a discounted exam price, which really helps now that I no longer have vision coverage. I can't recommend them enough.]
