[109631299333410845871,100675646213176954465,Thanks guys, i Love my new WRX! --> It was my first time financing a car and these guys went above and beyond to cut me the deal I was looking for. Buddy, Al and Mo really came though for me. They also helped me along every step of the way and made sure I left feeling like I had become part of the Maita Subaru family. I'll definitely be brining my car back for all the tune ups and will be keeping in touch. My Dad bought his Forester here in 2004 and I'm glad I headed his advice to shop here. Since this was my first experience buying a car in a while I was worried about being taken advantage of, but the second I walked inside and met Buddy, I could tell he was a genuine person. He made the entire experience easy and fun. Thanks again guys, see ya at 3000 miles!]
