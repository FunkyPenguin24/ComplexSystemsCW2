[115095841245598892447,100426615325040616383,The appointments due tend to run a little behind, so I never really count on getting in exactly at my scheduled time... Everyone is very nice. They don't hold you down and force floss you like some dentists I've been to. My first visit was due to an abscess caused by a degraded wisdom tooth... Thanks to them, I finally gave in and agreed to getting all the dental work I'd been putting off for close to 10 years. I had all 4 wisdom teeth pulled, a full periodontal cleaning, and 8 cavities filled in just under 3 hours, all while completely asleep for most of it (I was woken during the fillings to give the anesthesia time to wear off so I could walk). They really know how to educate you about their procedures and the best way to do things to avoid complications. The best part was that I was in no pain the next day and was even out running errands with no swelling. It would be nice if they would work with more insurance companies and discount dental programs to make their practice and option for those of us more financially pressed, but there are a variety of payment plans available through Care Credit which has been very helpful. The only real negative thing in my eyes is that I selected sedation dentistry because of my anxiety with dental appointments, but I can't seem to get gas for those appointments. I will stick with them until I find a place that will do gas though because again, they are really nice :)]
