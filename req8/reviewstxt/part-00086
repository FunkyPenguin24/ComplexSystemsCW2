[111203539674179434429,100163359011703662003,If you're looking for a stress-free (even enjoyable) car-buying experience, I recommend going to Linden. Went by Linden VW today to look at buying my first car. I went in with my guard up. I was under the impression (this being my first buying experience) that you need to play down your income or what you can afford, otherwise, they will jack up the price... My experience was the extreme opposite of what I expected going to buy a new car. I ended up buying a Passat and driving it home the same day. They spent over 4 hours with me, going over every possibility - not once did I feel that I was getting screwed on the price. They even went out of their way to make sure that I got everything that I was looking for AND fit into my budget. Also, I definitely recommend working with John Rios (salesperson) or the manager, Anthony. Good people.]
