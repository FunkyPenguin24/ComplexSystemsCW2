[117449747558560412124,100889598906250232093,This is our favorite local family restaraunt. We eat here all the time. The nightly specials are awesome values and it's a cozy, friendly, welcoming 'ol timey American style kind of neighborhood place for locals to relax and eat a nice affordable square meal after a hard days work. We also enjoy stopping by on weekend mornings for a quick and easy breakfast on the way out to recreational and or entertainment pursuits. The bloody Marys and biscuits and gravy are good hang over fare and all of the waitresses are great...just don't be lame and ask stupid questions if you can see they're busy or not in the mood for dealing with BS.]
