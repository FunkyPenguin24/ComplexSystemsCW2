[100296917485434331571,100231343490034393207,This place is a GEM (we came here for dinner). After, 2 weeks of very budget travel in south america Zea Mais was a most welcome piece of luxury. The front desk/greeter has excellent english and is well traveled in general, the food was spectacular, 4 course meal, great down-tempo electronic music, very nice modern decore of local artists. I cant say anough good things about this place. Oh.. and i "think" its one of Sao Paulos oldest hotels.]
