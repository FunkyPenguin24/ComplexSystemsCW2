[102011741256724540235,100205509065767821066,I just visited the Body Blitz East location for the first time for a soak and a scrub. Staff were very gracious and accomodating and the spa was exceptionally clean. I went alone on a weekday morning and it was very peaceful. I would HIGHLY recommend indulging in the Blitz Scrub- heavenly. (This would make such a great gift!) Natalia provided my treatment and she was extrordinary. If you book a treatment go an hour before to steam and soak. I enjoyed a lovely, calming and nourishing experience!]
