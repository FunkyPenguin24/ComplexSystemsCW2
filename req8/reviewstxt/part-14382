[115237473580893615558,100934088609657891890,This is a vet that is truly in it for the right reasons. Shes has taken care of our animals for several years and I never had a displeasing visit. Her staff always has a smile and always there to help. With every visit I had, the prices were always lower than expected. Being in the medical field myself, when someone charges for services well below the "going" rate it is a sign that they care more about their patients than they do about the money. This vet is absolutely amazing and there is no amount words that can explain how awesome this vet is. She also sponsors neuter and spay clinics for those interested. We used "Neuter for a Nickle", and yes is was only a nickle, for our male cat.]
