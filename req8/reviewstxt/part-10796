[103153505349725617158,100736228139118070878,We used the The Pros for our April 2013 wedding, following a recommendation by my sister and her husband, who used them in July 2005. DJ: Exceptional, fun, lively, didn't miss a beat~kept the ceremony music perfect and the party going all night! VIDEO: Did NOT disappoint. We barely knew he was there and caught so many wonderful moments during the entire day. Nicest guy! PHOTO: Wow-each shot was better than the last, made sure he took every shot we planned and then some! fun personality, high energy with our large wedding party PHOTO BOOTH: You gotta add that to the list. Fun props, guests loved it, we came home with copies of every shot-fun to see moments we missed...Highly recommend THE PROS!!]
