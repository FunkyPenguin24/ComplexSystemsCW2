[113419806820850452619,100942453484108840246,I purchased a package on Bloomspot and had an awesome time. The atmosphere was relaxing, and the complimentary champagne went a long way in helping to soothe my nerves. Carrie was my photographer and she was great at finding good poses and coaching me through the session. I'm very pleased with the final product, and already thinking up ideas for my next session! Highly recommended.]
