[109374392090891220665,100555653647350689664,We bought a rainbow 3 years ago and our kids love it! The staff made it easy for us to choose a playset within our price range and size restrictions. We recently added some monkey bars to our set. They had them installed within the week! Overall, I have been very pleased with the level of customer service and durability of the set. I would recommend rainbow to any family looking to purchase a high quality play system.]
