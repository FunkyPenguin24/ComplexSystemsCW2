Now I've been on the phone for over an hour, talking to no less than 6 representatives, and this one is about the transfer me too. Despite having a receipt, they claim I still have a piece of equipment. They've taken more than 500$ and want me to wait at least another 2 weeks while they "look into it." I'll be calling my bank and the better business bureau now. Assholes.]
