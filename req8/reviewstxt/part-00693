[103655140296649138198,100195741244525904320,My husband and I had a great experience when we were preparing to purchase our 2012 Hyundai Sonata in November 2013. We flew in from out of state, signed the papework and all was well. We were promised 2 items/parts that were not ready when we finished up the paperwork and were told that they would arrive at our home within approximately a week. We are now at the end of February 2014 and we have yet to receive the items and yet to receive tracking information. We are quite frustrated with the customer service we've received after our purchase. This is in addition to trying to iron out some other issues that surfaced with trying register our car in our state. It was a headache getting what we needed from this dealership!. Seems as though you need to have EVERYTHING ironed out before you sign any paperwork with these people. They are eager to get your business and make a sale but could care less about your needs once they've made a sale. I would say buy at your own risk....]
