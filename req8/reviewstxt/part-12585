[105400628669432520102,100832810700842204255,I was excitedly told about this pub as the place folk musicians would congregate to play and the pub parrot would greet you astride the landlords shoulder. Sadly the place has been smartened up, the parrot confined to a cage, food has replaced the live music and what can only be desribed as soul destroying pop music plays loudly from both the bar and kitchen. The food was ok. The bitter was rubbish. Staff friendly. Another pub lost to the gastroland disease. Sad.]
