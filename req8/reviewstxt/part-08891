[107062748817507943418,100632724723513397559,I have a rescue dog I got about a month ago. I've been into the TVC twice now. They are sooo good to work with. When the vet examined my dog, she sat on the floor and let Luna crawl in her lap. She was also very thorough. I'd been to another vet who barely looked at her and never picked up she was sick. So I'm really pleased with TVC. All of the staff is very friendly and seem to just love to be around animals. It's such a nice change!! I feel as if I've found my long term vet. Thank you!]
