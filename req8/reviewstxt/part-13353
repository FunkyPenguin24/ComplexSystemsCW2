[109289077251611150376,100876286037887773770,I took my yoga teacher training through Shanti and loved every minute of it. The studio itself is beautiful - clean, full of light and right downtown close to everything. The owner, Rene Johnson, is an inspiring teacher and creates a friendly, supportive atmosphere for all levels. I would never have been able to take the YogaWorks teacher training with Catherine Munro if it hadn't been for Rene's kindness, and my personal practice is infinitely richer as a result. Thank you Shanti!]
