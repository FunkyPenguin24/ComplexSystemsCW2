[118038992212878415960,100407226469623348996,This firm has amazing attorneys with superb professionalism and an undoubted respect for clients. Patricia Cooper helped my husband and I through a very difficult case, in which he had taken voluntary departure, was in removal proceedings and the case needed approval to be reopened. We had been working with a different immigration attorney for 2 years and the lack of communication and progress made us uneasy. At this point, we decided to look for other options for representation. We were referred to the Gerstein and Baret office by a colleague, where we met Patricia. She has led us through every step of this process and educated us along the way. She always responded quickly and efficiently. Without her help, we would not have been able to do this with just any immigration lawyer let alone ourselves. With her help, we were able to keep our family together during this trying time and can now rest easy. My husband and I will definitely be coming back to Patricia Cooper in three years when we can file for citizenship. I highly recommend her and associates.]
