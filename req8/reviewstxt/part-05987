[101612616344385020619,100476705395587784819,I bought a car from these guys even though I live six hours away. They were able to get me the truck I wanted and the payment I wanted. Rob P. was fantastic as a salesman, and the finance staff were also excellent. In fact, the truck only came with one key, and so they sorted out a key at a local dealership for me. Then, almost a month after I bought the truck, out of the blue I found a package from them in my post box! Rob had sent me the missing key! How awesome is that!?]
