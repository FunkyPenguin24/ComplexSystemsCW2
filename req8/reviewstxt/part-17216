[117896335980407009797,101087764027631757313,I absolutely have nothing but positive things to say about PickUp USA. The majority of my friends discovered this place January 2013, signed up, and continue to love it! All the other reviews and the website itself will tell you all the amenities, so instead of talking about those awesome features, I really just want to talk about the experience you get. There is not only an amazing community of basketball players that gather there all with the same love for the game, but there is also an incredible staff there that is really involved and gets to know members on a personal level! The staff doesn't even seem like staff (in a good way :]). They just seem like new friends you've met that just so happened to start up a wickedly cool basketball gym for all of your friends to play ball at. PICK-UP IS WELL WORTH THE $$$$. I was hesitant to write a good review because if TOO many people sign up and show up, I'll break too many ankles.... HAHAHAHA! (That was a joke if you didn't catch it....) Sign up, play with us, let's be friends!!! ^______^v P.S. Guys, don't worry, there won't be too much testosterone because there are some really skilled females that play... Do not underestimate them.... they will score on you ALL DAY. :P Ladies, sign up and show 'em who's boss. ;D]
