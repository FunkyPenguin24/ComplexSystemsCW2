[100048024766896003223,100728015961734309503,We were having trouble with our heat pump and called Integrity, they came out within 24 hours, found out what was wrong, and were back the next day to fix it. Later that evening something else went wrong, I called the next morning and they were here within an hour and had the problem fixed. The problem was something that was done by the people who had originally installed the heat pump. Their customer service representatives are friendly and more than willing to help. I would highly recommend this company!]
