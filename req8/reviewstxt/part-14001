[108402966646211464520,100911545309400443610,I flew in from Norfolk International airport to Tampa for holiday leave (I just got back from deployment) and I wanted to take my family out to lunch. The steak I had and the blooming onion we all shared was great. As was the server. I'll be back again after the holidays.]
