[108280743660344406171,100034131965561030559,The buying experience at Don Hewlett Chevrolet Buick in Georgetown with Lee Dickie was the most pleasant one I have ever had while buying a vehicle. Lee was courteous and was not pushy at all. The price was fair and he was more than willing to work with us to get the best deal we could for our needs.]
