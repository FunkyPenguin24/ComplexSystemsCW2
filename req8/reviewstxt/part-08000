[111216013172612229764,100587805813882348111,This place is awesome . . . lots of different shoes for all types of athletes and even mathletes as well. I bought a pair of shoes for my nephew here and the staff was very helpful in showing me how to design a unique pair with Nike id technology. I was a little sad that this used to be a Barnes and Noble where people could come and read on a Sunday morning, but Nike did a good job of using the same massive space and hiring good staff.]
