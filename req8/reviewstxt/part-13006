[100304738850662240316,100857219564265121562,This location is big and has a fairly decent selection. The reason I'm writing this is the praise the management, however. I had a situation where I ordered two items on the website during the 50% off everything sale during Black Friday. I had them delivered to my apartment, but when the USPS tracker said it was delivered the following week, I had not received anything. The post office either lost or stole both packages. I contacted Express's customer service and all that they did was refund me the money, which did me no good because I still wanted the sale prices. I went in to this Express with my story and the manager didn't even let me finish; he told me that he would mark both items down to what I paid during the sale if I could find the items that I ordered. I found both items in the store and showed him my online order confirmation and the refund confirmation, and he marked them at 50% off! Great customer service if you ask me. I highly recommend going here.]
