[104891866805437268634,100606726246380323591,We liked the experience at Morrie's Hyundai so much, we bought two cars! After doing our research for new cars (especially Consumer Reports), it looked like Hyundai was really going out of its way to make an excellent car at a good price. Based on a positive referral from a family member who purchased a car here last year, we dropped in to Morrie's Hyundai on 394 to test drive a new car. We started working with award-winning salesperson Steve Cherches, and he made the experience very pleasant and enjoyable. He's a straight-shooter with a good sense of humor, and he really worked as a champion for us in securing a hard-to-find Sonata! When you make a big purchase like buying a new car, you want to have fun while doing it. Steve very much made this a good time, and his availability by phone or text message really was appreciated. Every one from the sales, service and business teams worked hard to help us as well - and we recommend Morrie's on 394 to all of our friends who are looking for new cars. We ultimately bought an Elantra and a Sonata and are very happy with our purchases! We know that we got a lot of car for our money, and the service and support we received through the buying process was fantastic!]
