[100512945454030842773,100280059164796998119,I've just had dinner at this place. I've ordered the Japanese Teriyaki dish with chicken. It was just fine until I took a bite out of one piece of chicken and it was awful! It tasted like it was either old or someone must have rubbed their sweaty privates on it. I am disgusted and disappointed. This was my first AND last visit to this diner. I do not recommend this place for Asian cuisine. Other than the food, everything else was good.]
