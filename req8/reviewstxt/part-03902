[109487908688104829480,100363602902402597920,I visited for the first time about two months ago for a color and cut. Carly was my stylist and she did a wonderful job. I have very dark hair and decided after 45 years to go lighter. She advised on the best way to about changing the color gradually. The cut was very cute and the prices compared to other salons in the area was quite reasonable. I am getting ready to make my next appointment.]
