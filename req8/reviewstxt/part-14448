[100246738806765983405,100937245215250121787,Great dance floor. Lots of nice people, good piped-in music, and the bands are usually good or better. The help is nice and hard-working, and the drinks are reasonably priced. Dance lessons there, too. Never had the food, but it looks good w/generous portions. Worth going there!]
