[113884119221077595735,100619719256459750911,An excellent place to stay for the Morro Bay area. Right at the freeway exit where Highway 1 meets the 41. Only downside I can think of is that the Breakfast is not exactly top of the line, but if you are a cereal eater and love non-fresh muffins, then you'll love it. Morro Bay has plenty of places to eat, so I'm thinking the free breakfast as an appetizer Market avenue (kind of like a Broadwalk area) is less than a 5 minute drive from the hotel. Highly recommended for its price and presentation.]
