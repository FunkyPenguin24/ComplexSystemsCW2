[112068811384766018590,100485464270451585777,I LOVE Touch Healing Wellness and Spa! I've been in pain since the early 90's and in my first visit with Dr. Mike Rivers, I was relieved of a pain that has kept me awake most every night! After visiting with Dr. River, I unwind in the "relaxation room" with soothing, tranquil music to calm your soul after a busy day while waiting for my fantastic message therapist, Jackie, who's hands are like no other message I've ever had! Touch Healing Wellness and Spa is the total package with the services and skin care treatment they offer! It's an incredible experience!]
