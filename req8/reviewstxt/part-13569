[113715907548688206116,100889068377691751124,Absolutely the best psychiatrist in the green bay area. She takes the time to talk to patients as a counselor would before making medication decisions. This is something that is very uncommon with psychiatrists but is the key to being a good one. On top of that, she is neither "liberal" nor "conservative" with prescribing - she simply does what is good for the patient. She's quite spacey, yes, but I'd rather have an absolutely excellent doctor who doesn't always return calls than have a mediocre one who does. :) By the way, she's at aurora in depere now.]
