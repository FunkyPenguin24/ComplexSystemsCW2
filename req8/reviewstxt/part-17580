[109900341061330982096,101107342931415994208,We have been taking our 2 dogs to this great place for over 4 years now for their monthly "spa" experience. They get the full treatment and always come out looking clean and fresh and excited for their treat when they get home. The staff are kind, considerate and respectful and seem to really enjoy their work. I have personally experienced their ability to go above and beyond for their customers. I so appreciate being able to drop our "babies" off there and not having to worry about them. We have never had a negative experience with these special people and will continue to use their services. I have no hesitation in recommending Justine and The Groom Room.]
