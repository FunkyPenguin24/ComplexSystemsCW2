[105622187007877829566,100265424460907991972,I am a regular at the Pour House, especially for their Jazz/Fusion shows. Adam has his finger on the pulse of the hottest, coolest musical acts and brings them to the the Pour House from all over the world. The recent Hiatus Kaiyote (Australia) and Snarky Puppy (Brooklyn) shows are great examples of bringing cool to the area! The venue itself has a great deal of character and back alley ambiance, a characteristic that is becoming a rarer commodity in downtown]
