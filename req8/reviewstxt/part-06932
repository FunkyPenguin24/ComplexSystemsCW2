[111190297746450837180,100529554358230580351,Best place I've ever been ever. My son has autism and had a 105 fever all weekend sweating crying coughing you name it, I brought him in and I kid you not of the 100s of drs ive seen for my sons autism The nurse Laurie and the other 2 women on staff were AMAZING with him. They acted like it was their kid and got him to do things no DR could get him to do without a huge fight. They even gave him the medicine on the spot and had us stay to see if he had a reaction and I cannot tell you what that feels like for a mother of child with Austim. So pleased.]
