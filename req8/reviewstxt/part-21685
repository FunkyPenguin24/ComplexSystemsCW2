[115278453172947058875,100150083426905862111,Our son had been struggling for a couple of years, but we kept thinking that he would catch on eventually. By the sixth grade he had not only failed the TAKS test, but also two subject classes and with no TAKS retest for sixth grade he had to repeat the grade. His self esteem tanked. During his repeat year his self esteem recovered a little, but he was still struggling. In seventh grade his attitude was better, but he realized that after the next year he would still be in Junior High and his friends would moving on to the High School campus. He asked if it were possible for him to catch up enough to make it to his correct grade level, and with Sylvan's assessment it seemed attainable. Since starting at Sylvan our son has grown in his self worth and skipping has become less important. His missing gaps are being filled and he has become proud of his achievements. His new attitude is affecting all of his activities. We are very pleased with his progress and happy that our smart sensitive boy has returned.]
