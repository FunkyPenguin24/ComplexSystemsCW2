[101942816775750618904,100329360168747080121,Excellent. Very helpful staff, who kindly gave me a few (essential) nuts and bolts to fix my pedal with. Great location, right beside Glasgow Uni. Also bought a neat set of lights there 3 years ago and the batteries haven't shown any signs of running out! (Great lights too). Thoroughly recommend the place.]
