[105634047178717100282,100898215511812418052,I had a great experience purchasing my used Ford Focus at Drive America. This is surly a gem for car dealers in the Watertown area. Both Al and Cam are great and assisted me in test driving a few different models. Cam was very knowledgable about each car I tried and answered any questions I had. They were truly interested what was the right "fit" for me and didn't try to push a more expensive model or car when the Focus was obviously the right fit.. Very Respectful!!! Thank you Drive America for being so kind and providing a service a step above other dealers. I will sure be back again.]
