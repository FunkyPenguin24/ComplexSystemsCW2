[100999280155803174397,100732609757313221075,Husk - Nashville is a great place to grab lunch or a drink after work. With great service and great atmosphere, this new spot in Nashville will quickly become a favorite of the city. It is already a favorite of mine. I will be taking clients here for lunch for years to come. Try the shrimp and grits! I was very pleased with the quality from top to bottom. It is also worth mentioning that the prices are very reasonable. Try it today!]
