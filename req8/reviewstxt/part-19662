[110153597364748360567,100041935785731021265,I had a horrible experience the waitress there are rude and mean and pretty stuck up. Only a one good waitress try to help us out after she saw that our actually waitress was just ignoring us the entire time. We end up leaving because we had already waited for more than an hour for our food and the stupid manager blamed on the kitchen. But it was the waitress cause I saw my food being there ready for more than 15 minutes sucks for them cause I normally tip at least 8 dollars cause I have a kid of 2 years and I know they not easy but for ones my daughter behave and the place was in his worse. NEVER would I eat here again]
