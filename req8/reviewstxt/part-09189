[105162540913864325682,100648881607559201736,I moved out of a Hubbard Bowers property today and had a very painless move-out process with the maintenance manager, Anthony. He was punctual, respectful, and very personable during the walk-through of my apartment. I had several maintenance requests over the time period that I rented with HB and they were all filled in a timely and efficient manner. In my experience with other landlords, maintenance requests have been ignored or taken days-weeks to fix but their online tool makes appliance issues easy and quick.]
