[106259399267945164932,100680817922771390594,Donald MacbethJr Being a Charter Member of the Fitworks Anderson family I can tell you that I have seen tremendous growth in the facility. This club has two cinema theaters filled with tread mills, bicycles, eliptical machines and stair climbers. The one cinema plays ESPN and sport channels. The other cinema plays current hit movies. I enjoy the choices I have while I workout. The club offers exciting, fun, and challenging classes taught by knowledgeable caring instructors from Spinning to Group exercises such as Zumba Dance, Step, TRX Training, to various Bootcamps depending on your fitness level. The gym is clean and friendly. I am glad to say that I have recommended the club to friends, co-workers, and family and they are still active members of "The Fitworks Family. All I can say is give the gym a try and you too will see what I am talking about. I have been able to lose weight and build strength. Thank You, Fitworks and keep up the motivation we all need to keep coming back. IGYD]
