[101480078699508626942,101134523894679412878,As a manager in a body shop we are always looking for a perfect parts source and after years of dealing with Joey,Jesus,Juan & Lou, I can say with total honesty that I would not deal with anyone else for VW parts. They are always accommodating, knowledgeable, professional, and always follow through. The same can be said of their service department. When we have a vehicle issue we need help with they are always there with the same type of professionalism and prompt service. Andy Charnota Chicago Collision Center]
