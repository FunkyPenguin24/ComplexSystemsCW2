[100384008045323107698,100238770080788751888,There isn't much variety for gay bars in Phoenix and Charlie's is probably one of the better choices. The point of focus is the drink specials. Sundays from 4-7 they have 3-for-1 drinks and the bartenders know how to pour a good stiff drink. Thursdays they have 2-for-1 drinks. They also have cheap beer they serve in small pitchers. Probably at least 32 ounces usually around $3-$5. Fridays are the best nights to go in my opinion. This bar is probably the least pretentious gay bar worth going to in Phoenix. Don't expect luxury.]
