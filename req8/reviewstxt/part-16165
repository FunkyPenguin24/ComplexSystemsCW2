[100342901282129449888,101029877968799278614,I am disappointed with all Social Secuity Administrations locations due to the fact that everywhere online has their hours from 9am-3 or 3:30pm M-F. Today I went to two different locations to find out that they both closed at 12pm on Wednesdays. Seeing as the business is only open for 6 hours during the work week it is challenging to find time to go if you work a 9-5 job. It is even more frustrating that the hours are not correct online and you cannot connect easily to a person over the phone. Overall, I would say very poor.]
