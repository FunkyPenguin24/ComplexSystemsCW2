[101450885733629450126,100795329922789854543,I completey agree with Janet. This office is very dishonest, misleading and disreputable. I also purchased the Amazon deal for 97% savings and $3000 towards invisalign. I was very clear when I scheduled my appointment asking about the prices. The lady on the phone assured me more than once that I would not be paying for anything except for the Amazon deal that I've already purchased and the retainers at the end. She said everything else was already covered. I would not have scheduled the appointment or wasted two hours of my work day and my entire lunch break to go there for nothing. The girl at the front desk and Dr. Z's assistant were both very friendly and helpful, but the lady who did the financing was extremely short, rude and condescending. She quoted me $6,500 for 12 months of invisalign. Since when is it that much to begin with? Janet is right when she said all they did was inflate the price to match the deal! As soon as I told her that I could not afford to pay the monthly payments that I was not even aware of to begin with, she pretty much said bye and walked out of the office ahead of me, like she had the same conversation many times before. I was promised on the phone that I would not be paying for anything but retainers, is it wrong of me to expect to get what I was promised? In this day and age, with all of the social media outlets and review sites I cannot believe someone would act in such a dishonest and unprofessional manner and risk their reputation. Whoever is responding to these reviews is clearly not a reputation management professional or Dr. Z, as their responses are rude, abrasive and unapologetic. If it is Dr. Z then he must clearly not care about his customers' opinions at all. I feel cheated, mislead and flat out insulted. I will be letting everyone know of my experience to save them the hassle.]
