[110281985300821893258,101117452482077919482,I relocated to Surprise AZ about a year ago with my brand new Soul. At first I went to Sands Kia for the convenience and now I wouldn't go anywhere else. Eddie, my personal service rep (cool to have by the way), always greets me with a smile. My Soul has had all of the scheduled maintenance done at Sands Kia and I know I've saved money. They are prompt, courteous and professional. Why go anywhere else?]
