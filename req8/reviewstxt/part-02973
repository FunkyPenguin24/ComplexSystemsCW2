[115850289630980860391,100312802529718082284,Worked with Brad from the sales department - I spent two months and ~15 dealerships looking for a Yamaha FX HO for what I wanted to spend. Not only did I find it at Orlando Yamaha, they threw in a cover, fire extinguisher, and two life jackets. They beat the next closest dealer by $500 and the furthest by $3,000. Thanks guys, I'm a lifelong customer now - I'll be looking for a Mule this coming January.]
