[103898233953008007012,100336391862000216654,We have been to Venus Sophia Tea Room several times, and we always suggest to our guests that they go there too, it is a wonderful "gem of a place' tucked away in Chinatown, where the decor and atmosphere inside is quiet, comfortable, spacious and totally conducive to the enjoyment of their patrons. The staff and management are welcoming and gracious and the tremendous selection of teas, coffees, baked goods as well as delicious vegetarian dishes, are a pleasure to enjoy. Highly recommended by us, and by many of our guests who have taken the time to go there.]
