[101594600314498917854,100588226856890478642,I am from New Jersey, and fairly new to the hobby. My friend has been more experienced than I am, but we keep a tank together in his office at work. I have ordered from Dave/Zach both online, over the phone, as well as in person. I was on business travel, that had my near and decided to go with my friend to check the place out. I have been to a number of stores in New Jersey, most of which I won't even buy from, and I would say that I amazed at the corals and reef keeping at Vivid Aquariums. Dave provides high quality of service, and spend several hours showing us around and helping us make selections. They are not perfect, but, I will say they seem to try pretty hard to give a high level of customer service. I would recommend them for purchase both in person and online.]
