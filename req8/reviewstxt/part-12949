[101502971098395212566,100854171252443698657,Was just were planning to stay in Ottawa as a resting spot on our way to Quebec City. This hotel changed our plans and we spent more time exploring the city. Everything was perfect here from the check in to the beautiful 6th floor room with a balcony to the great location. We got this hotel on Hotwire so paid substantially less than regular rate but I think the regular rate is a great deal.]
