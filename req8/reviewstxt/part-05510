[109122403767347584487,100451555970276441816,I had my water pump blow out on my 2006 330xi. I had my car towed to the first BMW mechanic that showed up on google search which happened to be Boyd Motor Works. They called me when they started working on it to give me the quote. They quoted me at a little over $1300 to replace the water pump and the thermostat. I called Portland BMW dealership and asked for the same quote. They quoted me $1100. I called Boyd back and they stated that it was a computer glitch that caused the high quote. I accepted that and they told me $1100 for the fix (This seamed very strange to me based on previous experiences that a private small mechanic would charge as much as the dealership but I had not choice at this time). Once finished, I talked to my old mechanic and two BMW dealerships to compare pricing. Boyd charged me for the initial inspection ($100) even though I had them fix the problem. BMW dealerships don't even charge you for this if you have the work done with them. Boyd charge me the same amount for the cost of both the thermostat and water pump that the dealership charges. Previously private mechanics charged less than BMW dealerships for work I had done. Boyd charged $100 per hour (BMW dealerships charge $120). In the end Boyd charged me $70 less for labor (3.5 hours) yet $100 more for assessment then two BMW dealerships would have done. This means that in the end I paid $30 more to have Boyd do the work that Portland BMW. Does this make sense? I called my old mechanic (John's Auto Care in Medford Oregon) and they quoted me $850 for the work. They said I should not get charged the $100 for assessment and they would have sold me the parts for a discounted rate from what BMW sells them. To make things worse, I asked them how much to replace valve lifters in my engine that cause a ticking noise. Boyd said this would be a 3-4 thousand dollar fix because of how far into the engine they had to go. I asked John's auto care about this. They quoted me $1000 - $1100. They said it was a 4 hour job. To be clear, John's is a certified BMW mechanic. They have all the required equipment and computers to read all the sensors, and to correctly do the timing for the vehicle after a job like this. Their mechanics are ex BMW dealer mechanics. They quoted me 2-4 thousand below Boyd for this job. Bottom line, based on this single experience, Boyd overcharges for their work and appeared to rely on customer ignorance with regard to cost of service. I would have gladly been a return customer and raved on this review if they had treated me fairly. I would like to reiterate that the work they did appears to be done well. I do not have any problems with my cars coolant system since my fix. This poor review is purely due to being taken advantage of financially.]
