[103299264891963358469,100885994638914122147,New York summer can be brutal, so my heart stopped when my A/C stopped working last month. A buddy mentioned Evergreen, so I called them up to come fix the machine. An hour later, a technician was on my doorstep, and two hours later my apartment was cooled to perfection. The repair was surprisingly affordable considering it's New York, and I was impressed by how quickly the job was done. I'd definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a quality A/C repair service. Prompt, professional, and pleasant - the three P's of any good service in my opinion.]
