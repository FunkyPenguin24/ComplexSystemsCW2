[108585931159155729350,100198650027473351583,The only store in Austin that can justifiably claim to be the go-to place for professional photographers. (Years ago there were competitors, but no more.) The Repair department is very good. Sales Dept includes my favorite knowledgeable, helpful photographic equipment consultant in town--if I tell you who he is, I'll have to wait even longer to talk to him. (I've heard of other salesfolks not being so helpful, but I find the service great from him.) Rentals is pretty good for almost any need. Used equipment choice is pretty good, too. If you're a pro, or advanced amateur, you'll find it your best bet for solving almost any photo problem. I'm a 40-year working professional photographer, and a fan... If there was no Precision Camera, Austin would be a bleak place for the working pro.]
