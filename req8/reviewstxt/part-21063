[104952428114496181651,100116259008796143036,Parks were fun, but pretty crowded. Bring your own food for meals though. Fed a family of four at lunch one day...$38 for two pops, a couple chicken strip baskets with fries and two mini corn dog baskets with fries. Food was not good and portions were small. In short...parks fun, food spendy and not good. Some of the park staff were quite rude as well but the rest were very nice.]
