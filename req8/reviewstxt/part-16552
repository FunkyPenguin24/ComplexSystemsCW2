[110806850674704008220,101049995746213654995,I came to Transitions in July of 2006 and with the help and encouragement I received there, I just celebrated 7 years sober. I had been to a couple places in NJ and to no avail was drunk within weeks. I refused to take the suggestions of meetings, sponsorship and sober living because in my mind "I am not like them". I ended up in a detox/psych ward 2 hours from home after a desperate attempt to take my own life. While there, I made several attempts to call family and friends who refused to take my calls. I was then offered the opportunity to come to South Florida for treatment. I was scared, broken and most of desperate. Transitions helped to save my life. I was taken to outside 12 Step meetings where I heard messages of hope. In order to get more privileges, I was required to get a sponsor so I did. My sponsor was also an alumni of Transitions and she would show up there smiling and happy and all I ever wanted to be was happy in my own skin without substances. She is still my sponsor today. I didn't do it perfectly, but they never gave up on me. I think I cried everyday. Maria behind the front desk was an Angel, her smile and encouragement helped me every day. I would sit in the tech apartment all weekend and cry and Tim would say things like "put the bat down smiley". What I thought was the end of my life was just the beginning. I was 36 years old and had no idea how to live life, I mean I knew how to work and sometimes pay bills but to really live life I had no clue. I went to sober living, got a mindless job, went to meetings. worked steps and my life is beyond what I have ever imagined. I have real friends, a brother who is now sober 3 years, relationships with my family and a job in the treatment field where I help people everyday. Transitions is almost always on my gratitude list. They gave me the head start I needed and are still there for me when I feel the need to stop by for some grounding.]
