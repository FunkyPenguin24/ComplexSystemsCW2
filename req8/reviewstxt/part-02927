[112876517449220882666,100310236993350518350,Prices are high for the material products, but the info is a goldmine they give away free. I'm a CO native that left for the PNW for 16 years with the military. In the PNW I got into cider making through friends. Twice before I've tried brewing beer and quickly came to understand where the term "beer snob" came from. There's none of that at Barley Haven. Talking about the things I do out of the mainstream were met with interest rather than criticism and I was invited to come back when I had more time to learn more about brewing beer at no charge. I've been to Barley Haven twice now and both times experienced the exact opposite of what I expected in the Beer Capitol of the US (according the NPR, CO exports more beer than WI, CA and MO COMBINED). I've no doubt that I will become a regular despite the high mark up on actual products. If the tall bald guy or Elvis Costelo's twin (I'm terrible with names) spend half an hour explaining why hops are toasted or not, isn't that worth the extra $5 for a carboy?]
