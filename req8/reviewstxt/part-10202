[104491305612673770890,100704889403092993910,This place is a complete joke. I've lived in Miami for almost a year, and I'm still surprised people like this place. If I could give it zero stars I would, but I had to choose at least one. The staff is rude, the music is too loud, the DJ that was there on a Saturday night was completely lame, and there were supposed to be "free" drinks between 11 and midnight, but of course we stood in line forever, were let in about 2 minutes til, and then they wouldn't give us a free drink. Also, after waiting forever, there was hardly anyone in the place. I guess they just like making people wait outside so they're more angry when they get in, thus more eager to throw down money for drinks. Gin and Tonic $12, but so are tequila shots, so I had one or two. Don't waste your time or money on these classless people.]
