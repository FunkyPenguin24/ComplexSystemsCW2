[113716646360039088654,100244428879913406324,This shop is very clean and professional, it doesn't "feel" sterile, but when I looked carefully, I saw the working areas were pretty close. The artwork done by Dusty and Craig is awesome! I always get positive remarks about my two pieces that were done here. As for bad attitude from the artists, well, you get what you put out! These guys always spoke appropriately to walk-ins while I was there.]
