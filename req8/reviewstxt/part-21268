[102818041687512601005,100127325517636930873,My wife and I recently sold our home and purchased another thanks to Steve Hopkins. We have referred Steve to our friends over the years, and when it was time, we asked him to list OUR home. He helped us select a competitive price, gave us valued advice on staging it, managed a very effective marketing campaign. We were able to attract an all cash buyer for close to the asking price. Once we had the cash, Steve helped us find suitable temporary housing so we could wait to pounce on a short sale opportunity, which we were able to do. During the long short sale process, he kept us posted regularly and kept our spirits up as we waited. Finally, we closed on our current home, and we are thrilled with the home, the entire process, and with Steve. Throughout the many month process, Steve was always responsive, understanding, patient with us, and never tired of showing us homes. We always felt so CONFIDENT with Steve. He paid attention to every detail. He even took me to the city planning office for the home I purchased to understand the future possibilities for the meadow adjacent to our new home. He is amazing.]
