[113051711376870094963,100962438371078393301,Janet has been my mortgage broker for close to ten years now, since the purchase of my first home. She has always been dedicated to me as a client, ensuring that I understand the mortgaging process and find the very best rate available. She has always been extremely easy to get a hold of, and returns her messages very promptly. Though I now live in a different province due to a military posting, Janet still sends a calendar or gift certificate every year, along with Christmas cards and newsletters. This kind of customer service is extremely hard to find, and when our mortgage is up for renewal she will be the first person I call.]
