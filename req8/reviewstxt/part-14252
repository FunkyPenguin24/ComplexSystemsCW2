[107734293206167648709,100925787329197957809,Try any of the beers on offer from this small but prolific brewery. 'Bluesbreaker' comes highly recommended - as Tina Turner screeched out years back "Simply the best"!!! All I can say is recommended. Get in touch, as he not only sells to pubs all over the North West (by the Barrel), he also offers his very tasty brews in smaller 10L bags for home consumption and is a very friendly, easy going chap to buy from. He also caters for parties and goes the extra yard to help you out, I heard he even went down a mine to cater for a party of pot-holers - haha proper nuts!]
