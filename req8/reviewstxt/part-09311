[105543497602656093598,100656075786628153030,We were invited to The Mercat Bar through business for dinner and a wine tasting with no preconceived ideas about the venue, but goodness were we surprised and ended up having one of the best evenings we have had in a long time. The food was delicious the wines absolutely gorgeous and Grahame our host couldn't have been more welcoming. This is a venue you could choose for numerous outings. Just an early supper on the way home from work, a casual meal before or after the cinema, or a whole evening spend enjoying good food and wine with a special person or lots of friends. It is not haute cuisine, nor does it pretend to be, just using excellent quality produce making it very good value.]
