[110597064861540385228,100986185597422291827,I completely disagree with Rahool in regards to Tayyabs being the only place to go. Roughly 10years ago the management changed and the original man (uncle Tayyab) changed over to a younger batch of staff and the food has never been as nice as the 90's and early 00's. With regards to Hayfield the food here is the best value in terms of taste and quantity in this price range (of roughly Â£10-15 per head) in all of East London. I'm not biased either as my father knew uncle Tayyab so well!]
