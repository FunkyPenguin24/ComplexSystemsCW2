[105638189574627046531,100265572056982436680,I stopped in Barb's bakery this morning because I couldn't find anything except McDonalds or gas stations, and I refuse to continue buying CEOs new cars and vacation homes. I was greeted warmly by a young woman (who was not Barb; she passed away some time ago), and she helped me decide on a cheese danish. Oh My God. Amazing. I hope the people of Phoenix realize what a gem this bakery is, and decide to give their business to this beacon of quality, customer service, and damn fine pastries. Thanks Barb!]
