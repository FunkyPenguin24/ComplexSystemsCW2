[105114758455138313538,100058390771478162507,My wife and I decided to meet some other friends up at Combat Houston. Most of us had never played before and we were very nervous about playing. The staff is absolutely amazing!! Made us feel comfortable and right at home!! The field was amazing and fun. Don't know too many places that I would stay and play at for 3 1/2 hours but Combat Houston is the place!! We played for 3 1/2 hours and can't wait to go back again!! If you love paintball, then this place is a must! If you have never played before but you're looking for a new and exciting way to burn some calories, the this place is a must!! Just a small warning for the people who have never played before, once you play at Combat Houston, you will be hooked!!]
