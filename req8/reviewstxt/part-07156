[100569233223614900104,100540947186776395729,Save yourself time and money. Go somewhere else. I got my hair cut by a stylist who left it an inch shorter on one side. She was a friend so I politely asked for my money back after my mom gasped when she saw my hair. Terri the Manager, was argumentative and very rude. After "refunding" my money I spent 2 hours at another salon getting it fixed. When checking my account I see that she charged me again instead of refunding me. I called she said she didn't have a district manager and argued with me some more. After reading me the riot act that my money would be returned I grew angry and lost my temper. I contacted my bank who told me she did not attempt to return the money but instead charged me. They would immediately see a refund which they didn't only that when she swiped my card they actually charged. I'm a former Cosmetology student myself and know when someone messes up good customer service is to refer them to the district manager which Terri so conviently does not have. This situation has frustrated me to no end. DO NOT go to this place unless you want screaming kids and rude stylists not to mention a horrible haircut.]
