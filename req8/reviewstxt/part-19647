[116379513784484894091,100041035901359045768,Dear Friends, New Shores( NIME) is a fake institute who takes admission stating they are running a college, instead it is just a learning center – blacklisted learning center who is running a MBA course by Punjab Technical University. NIME claims to give 3 types of MBA course – Executive MBA, Global MBA and diploma in MBA. All this is fake – if you call PTU directly, you will get to know these are names given by New Shores( NIME) and not by PTU. Any student gets admitted in New Shores( NIME) to pursue MBA will be divided into 3 groups designed by New Shores( NIME) . As per the groups the fees is charged to the student. Example: 3, 80000/- is the fees for Global MBA – they promise a laptop and industrial trip and what not – All is crap – after the fee payment – they say college is going through ruff phase and have no funds to give out the said facility – this is real and happened with my fellow mates at New Shores( NIME) . Actual fee designed by PTU is Rs. 11200/- only and the course is MBA( does not have different fees or different categories) adding to that, these guys do not have complete faculty to start the course on time and at the end they either skip the topics or say that it can be left as we will have options in Question paper. Another instance where admission for MBA is done( Rs. 20, 000), and its been 2years where a student has still not received the date for class commencement. When called, either the contact person is changed, or New Shores( NIME) is busy with fake collaborations or they blame on PTU for not starting the course on time – if these does not work – student is blamed for not contacting New Shores( NIME) regarding admissions. All MBA aspirants out there, be aware of this institution. Never Join. Never recommend. Never Choose – New Shores( NIME) Spread the word and save your friends. All the best.]
