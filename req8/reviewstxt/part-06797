[102381284386680366683,100522038072163787948,My trip to the pyramids and the Sphinx was amazing! The best $6 I've ever spent was spent for entry into one of burial chamber inside one of the pyramids. My wife and I were bombarded by local "entertainers" I guess you could call them, but we were warned about them ahead of time. TIP: DO NOT give your camera to any of the local people to take your picture of the pyramids. A couple of people who were traveling with us made this mistake and had to give up $50 or their watch to get their cameras back. The "police" did nothing as the person taking the picture was "performing a service" and it was the traveler's fault for not stipulating a payment for the service ahead of time. So yeah, ignore the local "entertainers" and just have a great time talking in the wonder.]
