[117147697986187950327,100651763173930530784,I first starting going to Apple Valley Chiropractic & Rehab after getting rear-ended in 2010. I started going to Mandy for lower back massages to loosen up the muscles. She did an amazing job! She was very friendly and really made me feel at home. I started seeing Jon a few sessions later and he was the same way. They are both very professional and really know what they are talking about. I had to get a few x-rays and MRI and they explained to me what they saw and what I should do to help strengthen by lower back. I have since moved to Colorado and I am afraid to go to anyone else. I have tried to go to a few massage therapists out here but no one matches up to Mandy. I make sure to schedule appts with them whenever I am in town because I know what kind of service I am going to get when I am there.]
