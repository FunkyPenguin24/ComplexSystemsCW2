[101209454608318321486,101130639021757796568,The Staff at Enchanted Shoe Repair took a look at my Suede Messenger Bag that I use for school, evaluated the bag and gave me a reasonable time to return it to me in a repaired condition. The product was returned to me on the day it was promised, the messenger bag was repaired for a very reasonable charge, and the work performed was done so amazingly well, that you can't even tell that this was a repair, it looks like new ! Thanks so much for a job well done ! If you're considering having a leather repair, these guys are very trustworthy and do a great job !]
