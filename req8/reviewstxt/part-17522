[115011957602861086870,101104394401990103546,My experience with Executive Services was excellent. I, like many people thought that my resume was already pretty good, but after allowing Ms. Dunham to work her magic, my resume was 10 times better. Unlike any other resume service I've known, Ms. Dunham took the time to sit down with me and get to know me as well as my goals in the world of work. She asked pertinent questions about the field I was pursuing, about my character, and about my background and professionally and beautifully descripted me and my goals on a one page resume that I'm sure will grab the attention of many employers. If you are a college grad, a person trying to breathe life into your career journey, or even just someone looking to update your resume, I highly suggest calling Ms. Dunham and setting up an appointment with Executive Services. You will NOT regret it because QUALITY goes a long way.]
