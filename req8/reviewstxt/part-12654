One thing I got was a recommended Turkey Wrap and I thought they had accidentally given me a quarter sandwhich. It was literally 5 inches long total. I don't know anything about the history of this place, but they must be proud of their food and have been around for a while cause they wouldnt have lasted a month with doll house portions like this.]
