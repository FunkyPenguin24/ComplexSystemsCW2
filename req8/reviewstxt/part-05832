The support staff is great! and very helpful, but we need to consider that the hospital is new and currently running under capacity. Hope they continue to provide the same quality of service when they are running full. Cafeteria is very good, prices are reasonable and apart from the cafeteria they have a coffee day, subway and fresco kitchen.]
