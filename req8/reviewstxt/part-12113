[110246485203195894439,100807132361815474887,This is our favorite local restaurant and where we always go for special occasions. The Seafood Gambero is wonderful, although I ask for it to be less spicy. The steaks and grilled chicken fillet are also great. Best thing ever tho is the kids mac and cheese. It costs extra to have it as the side dish for an adult meal - but well worth it. Or cosy up to a kid who doesn't eat much!]
