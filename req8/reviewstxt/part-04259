[101591293145186092644,100384883810012919124,So happy with my purchase and experience here! Aaron Brown was such an easy and friendly guy to work with. Answered all my questions, was very thorough and knowledgeable. Didn't try to sell me anything I didn't want, gave me a great deal, and treated me with respect. I would highly recommend contacting Aaron for anyone who is in the market for a Subaru. His co-worker Frank Aparacio also seemed like a really trustworthy guy. There are a few guys at this dealership who you will definitely want to avoid... you can probably find their names in other reviews at this site or other sites. As for Aaron, however, I have nothing but good things to say about him and the deal he gave me.]
