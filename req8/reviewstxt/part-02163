[101953762825440933080,100270741205783705988,I was going to be 10 minutes late to my appointment after hitting some traffic and called ahead. The woman said it would be fine. When I arrived, they said they absolutely would not accommodate me and that I would forfeit that session in my series. I told them that for future reference, we do not do business like that in Los Angeles and that they must let a customer know that they won't be accommodated so that they don't have to drive across town just to be sent away. I obviously called management, got a full refund and DO NOT recommend going here. The place was dirty, the staff was rude and incompetent, and it was disgusting and low class.]
