[103527580867730954908,100887490547736828254,Spent almost 2 weeks there and loved every minute of it. The nicest people you could ever want to stay with. helpful, gave me great ideas for places to go, when I dropped my camera in a puddle of water my first day there, they gave me their camera to use the whole time! Brilliant place! A working farm, grow their own beef, veggies, have all kinds of classes, walks, right on the river to fish, great home cooked meals, quiet. I can't say enough good about it. Ber & Kevin are your hosts and will try to accomodate anything you need! I can't wait to go back!]
