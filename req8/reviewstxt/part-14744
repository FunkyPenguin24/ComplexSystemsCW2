[100385626514157688942,100952959305681922654,This is a very clean Red Lobster. I have seen far worse and it may eventually age. I would hope they keep up with appearance. They do not have much else to offer being a food chain. The staff assisting us were top-notch. It was a very pleasant atmosphere. Living in a Gulf Coast community, Red Lobster is the last place I would recommend for sea food. However, they have an excellent steak. I would never name their food as "great". With the pleasant service and good food, it makes for a fine night out. Be prepared to pay high for mediocre sea food and great steaks.]
