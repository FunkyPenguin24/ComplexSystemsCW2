[100918466002616598434,100377913145197025161,Professional, Courteous, and Wonderful are the first words that come to mind to describe my experience with the Octagon. I recently had a massage, and the atmosphere was welcoming and clean, and I felt refreshed and relaxed afterward. I went to the Octagon for years to get my hair done, and always had great experiences. I wish I still lived close and could still have my hair done there regularly. The owner is an amazing woman who I greatly respect. I would highly recommend the Octagon!]
