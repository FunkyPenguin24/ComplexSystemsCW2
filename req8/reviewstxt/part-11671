[101720449901587250556,100784017928384785817,Sad - USPS has lost over 10 do not bend photo envelopes in the last 3 months. Then a company has sent me a check for a payment 2x, check the address both times - it was right. No check. Called the post office and they apologized and couldn't believe their was a problem with that driver, he has been a carrier for more than 30 years. They were suppose to call me back the next day after seeing if they could find the problem- it has been a week and all I get is a busy signal. Hundreds of dollars in product later, I am no further than I was before. And they wonder why we prefer using UPS when ever we can.]
