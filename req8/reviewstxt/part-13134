[110685494724280851749,100865088092046253305,Mimi's brought out a new menu last month and it is fabulous! The company I work for holds events at restaurants regularly and the wait staff and management at Mimi's are by far the best. I haven't tried the whole menu, but I've seen a lot of it brought out to our guests and it all looks and smells incredible. Bravo on becoming my new favorite restaurant! And you can't beat their half off bottles of wine on Wednesdays,... I recommend the shiraz!]
