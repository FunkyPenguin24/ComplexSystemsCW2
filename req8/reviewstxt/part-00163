[103101016727249851993,100167349149843826826,We stayed five days at the 1927 Charming Lakefront English cottage that they rent. It was outstanding! We felt welcome from the minute we entered; the owners were gracious hosts. With a big dock area, canoe and the whole large cove to swim, we were able to totally unwind. A ping pong table, large checker set and plenty of places to curl up and read gave us the opportunity to get away. Cable TV was there if we needed it, but weather was so perfect we did a lot of outdoor things including horseback riding and exploring Chimney Rock State Park and ate every meal on the deck overlooking the lake.]
