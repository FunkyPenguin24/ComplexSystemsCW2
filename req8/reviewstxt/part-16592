But there was no difference, it was all great. WE will go back!! Went back for their wonderful buffet, love the meat balls and chicken and the pizzas a winner. 9-13. buffet grand as always, you need to try it. this buffet never disappoints!! 11-06-13 good as usual, 12-20-13 Great as always or we would not keep going back. The hubby says the deep dish is better than Giordano's.]
