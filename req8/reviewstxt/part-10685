[106191064910931839279,100730893445297387113,Service was A++. All staff were superb, but the chap in his 30's was especially attentive, chatter - but not over familiar. The food was very good, we opted for the menu rather than the menu, and in trust the portions were too big (we took the remains back in a doggy bag!). The only fault I have is I wish it was my local restaurant in the North East of England - we were down in Bradford staying the night to drop son off at airport on the Sunday. Lovely place, lovely food, lovely people and very reasonable.]
