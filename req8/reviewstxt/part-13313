[110186411322750562104,100874699323045658935,I can't say enough good about Green Brooms and the prolific and sincere talent that built and runs it. I started taking classes only this past December, and have developed an understanding and talent in the art of song beyond my expectations thanks in part to Rebecca - a most personable and accomplished instructor - and Manuel and Gyllian, who have made their dream a reality, and continue to do so with the utmost integrity in musical development and care for their students and staff. I've been intimidated by the prospect of entering the world of music for years -- and now, a mere 7 months later, I consider myself a confident and competent singer. Making the decision to learn music has changed my life, which sounds like a daunting task - but making the decision to do so at Green Brooms took care of that. I had my first recital last night, and I couldn't have been happier with the series of events. The overwhelming positive feedback from my friends and family, and various staff and students at Green Brooms Music Academy, was both intensely humbling and inspiring. I can now finally give myself credit where I suppose it's due, and recognize my efforts as not only successful, but also appreciated in the world of art that is song. I now plan on making music a much more integral part of my life, and sharing as much of it as I can with my friends and family. There are no word to express what it feels to have overcome the intimidation and self-doubt that held me back from these pursuits all these years.]
