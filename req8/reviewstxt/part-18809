We had not noticed it until we arrived home in Winter Haven. When I called in to speak with the manager, the phone rang multiple times until a fax picked up. When I called back in and spoke with a person calling themselves a manager, and I say that because a real manager would have enough sense to listen to a customer complaint, we were disconnected. When I attempted to call back in they no longer picked up the phone, they allowed it to roll over to the fax machine. So I faxed over a brief letter stating that I would be calling during the day when the General Manager would be available. AVOID this place, the food does not meet Taco Bell standards and the service doesn't meet anyone's standards from my experience.]
