[115689404094518500195,100758216189756480832,The folks at Davis Repair have been servicing our family's auto for the past 5 years and we couldn't be more satisfied! They charge a fair price for the quality work they provide and more important, they are honest and provide excellent customer service. All in all, Davis repair will be our auto mechanic for many years to come! Highly recommended!]
