[104496566680933491744,101123869815160231344,I have been to barbers in many parts of the world...Gula is by far the best I've ever experienced. She knows her craft very well and executes it beautifully. One of the things I love about her is that her technique is very soothing...at the end I felt as though I'd just had a massage. Not only did I get a great haircut but I felt great too. I will be back and I highly recommend her.]
