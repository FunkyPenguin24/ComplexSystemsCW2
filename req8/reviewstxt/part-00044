[112580490890645479268,100161301437668524507,I have been quite happy with my new Hyundai Veloster so far, and not only with the Southpoint Hyundai dealership but with the dealership in Bryan/College Station where I bought the car, Attendants have always been prompt to greet you, and they have always been very accurate regarding the estimated amount of time it would take to service the vehicle, returning the vehicle washed and vacuumed out. I couldn't be happier.]
