[116239369895753697533,100001720026046223438,The Doctor is wonderful...her staff is horrible. I was pressured into a deep cleaning that I felt wasn't really needed and at a huge cost. But the last straw for me was watching the lady at the counter pressuring an 80+ year old woman into getting a deep cleaning at a cost that she couldn't afford. She badgered her for several minutes all the while the woman was insisting that all she wanted was what her insurance covered. The office woman told her it would be "malpractice" for them to do less than a deep cleaning and they would be happy to finance the cleaning. Really?? Finance a teeth cleaning for an 80+ year old woman?? That was it for me. I've never been back.]
