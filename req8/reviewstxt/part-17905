[111700323082749775101,101124000623026736504,I recently purchased a new Lexus CT 200h from Johnson Lexus of Raleigh. It was definitely the best car buying experience I have ever had. Zacques Gray and the team at Johnson were fantastic. What I appreciated the most in the experience was the pressure free approach. Zack was extremely helpful in working with me and my limited schedule, including a great deal of email communication and a last minute test drive. I would highly recommend this dealership to others interested in a new or used car.]
