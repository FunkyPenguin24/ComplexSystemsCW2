[101897062756446095261,100710781539544449881,Golden Palace has the best "Springfield Style" Cashew Chicken in town. The only other places that are as good as them would be Shanghai Inn, and Canton Inn. Also, Golden Palace has a real good General Chicken. The chicken is always fresh and lightly battered. The Crab Rangoon is lights out, it has a slight sweet flavor to it. I wasn`t a fan of the Egg Rolls, they seem to be store bought from the freezer section. They crank the Coke products which is a good thing. I go there at least one to two times a week. A much needed addition to southeast Springfield.]
