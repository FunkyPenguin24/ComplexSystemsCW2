[111281814180967723450,100589355581924986219,I had the pleasure of visiting this beautiful park back in June of this year. This is a very beautiful, breath taking site. I am so glad our tour guide from Pink Jeep Tours stopped at the park and let us enjoy the beauty! ( We were on our way back to Las Vegas from the Hoover Dam)]
