[113999103776531016765,100626668574115859818,I wanted to get a Mystic Tan so I went to the the MT website and looked for locations. Planet Beach was nearby so I called and made an appointment. I didn't like how they asked for my name and phone number THREE times during the call, but I let it go. I asked the cost of the MT and was told I had to come in to get the price. That should have been my first clue. I asked if it was more or less than $50 and was told it was significantly less and that if I came in today, it would be half off. Once I arrived, I had to sit through 45 minutes of a hard product/membership sale. When I said that I really just wanted the MT, I was then told it would be $45. I asked about the special and was told it was only if I had a guest pass. Since I did not, it was full price. I should have walked out then, but I said fine, I just want the MT...but THEN I was told I would have to wait as it was in use. Nevermind that I had made an appointment and drove over a half hour to the shop. I lost my spot because they were trying to sell me skincare. I didn't appreciate the price change, I didn't appreciate having to sit through a "timeshare like" presentation. I didn't appreciate having to fill out 3 pages of paperwork AND do an online survey once I arrived. I won't ever recommend Planet Beach. There are a ton of tanning salons and genuine spas in my area that I would go to before ever giving a cent to Planet Beach.]
