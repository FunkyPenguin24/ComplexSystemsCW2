[110578705170343577816,101088188048872312086,I don't typically take the time to write reviews. However, I felt compelled to post this after dropping off two leather cushions today. The two individuals who run the shop, could not have been a nicer. They looked at the rips in the leather and talked me through the various options, the pros and cons of each, and quoted a more than fair price. I suppose the above doesn't do the experience justice... The bottom line is that based on my interactions with the owners and the way I saw them engage with other customers, I would definitely recommend Restoration Centre.]
