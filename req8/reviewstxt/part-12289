[100053859290032119764,100816817099832780816,Had a dead horn on one floor monitor. I took it out and he ran some tests. He wasn't confident the problem was strictly with the horn, but knew I was in a hurry for sound at a memorial service. He GAVE me a replacement horn. When I tried to give him money he waved it off saying he gets them too cheap for me to worry about it. You would never see this with a big company or on the internet--support local shops!]
