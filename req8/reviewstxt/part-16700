[104096556813820714656,101058742563750746159,My husband and I very much enjoyed our experience at Burns Ford. We traveled a long commute after work to see a vehicle on their lot in which we were very interested. We arrived about the same time they were closing. Levi and Freddy stayed after hours to help us make a decision about purchasing the vehicle. We never felt rushed or pressured in any way. They were very helpful and very friendly. We purchased the vehicle and love it! We had some questions that couldn't be answered until the next business day, in which Levi researched our questions and called me the next morning to answer everything I needed to know. We would definitely recommend Burns Ford as a reputable, no hassle dealership where you'll get friendly assistance.]
