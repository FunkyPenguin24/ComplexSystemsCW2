[110518680779830956364,100501008301030199811,I have known Karen for nearly 40 years and she has always been a empathetic person, and is truly a genuine friend! Karen has a superior eductional background, with undergraduate and graduate degrees from Washington University in Saint Louis - her graduate degree (MSW) was also followed by her licensure in Clinical Social Work. If I had to recommend someone who needs professional counseling, I would not hesitate to direct that person(s) to Karen.]
