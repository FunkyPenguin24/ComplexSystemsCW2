[106100262894423800613,100582649647433949208,I took my Honda CBR 929rr in for a leaky air valve, and to get valves checked as well as some other work. Matt was clear about what needed to be done, his turn around was accurate, and it was really nice to know that some other 'qualified technician' wasn't the one working on my bike as many larger shops have- it was the owner himself. Great service, seemed very knowledgeable and I will definitely be taking my bike back there for its service in the future. Highly recommended motorcycle shop!]
