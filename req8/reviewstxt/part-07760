[111343373094117089367,100574718081182291480,We had an absolutely unbelievable special experience there last night for our 15th Wedding Anniversary. It started off with a special greeting left on one of our menus autographed by The Chef himself and a table surrounded by 3 windows making us feel more special. My husband had the Springer Farm Chicken Ballotine Salad and I had the Crispy Herb Phyllo & House Cured Scottish SalmonNapolean for starters. Both were wonderful! For our main entrees, I had the Sauteed New Bedford Sea Scallops while he had the Grilled Stuffed Beeler Farms Pork Rib Chop. Every single dish we had was perfectly made and seasoned just right. Our only problem - we didn't have any room for desert! Next time, we'll plan accordingly. ;) Between the service upon arrival and during the meal and the meal itself, it was an amazing first time experience and a true celebration of our 15th Wedding Anniversary. Thank you, Second Empire. Well done!]
