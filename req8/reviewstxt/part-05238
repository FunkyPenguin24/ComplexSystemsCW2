[103720130089565131937,100437965560641574991,Don't confuse this place with the Hotel Serena Del Mar, which is a upscale wonderful hotel with a great quality food. Villa Serena is right before this hotel and has great music and drinks but the food is horrible and not fresh. The lobster was overcooked, the beans were not fresh, nor the rice and the salsa was watered down. This is all okay if your drunk, but if your a foodie you will not appreciate this place.]
