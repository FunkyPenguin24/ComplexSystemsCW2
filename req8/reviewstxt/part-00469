[116503714633642031306,100183185184576894014,Probably one of the most frustrating phone lybrinth I have ever had to negotiate to ask a simple question. I spoke with three different voice prompts that connected me to two different recptionists. I wasn't even able to speak with someone in the actual location. Word to the wise. If yoou are wondering if the Sears service department can help you, don't. They prpobably can help you, if you go into the store itself, otherwise plan on talking to a machine. The voice I did get, couldn't understand the brand of lawn tractor I had. He had no clue]
