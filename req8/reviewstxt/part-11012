[109339643165259732516,100748499086822695631,Coffee ok, service was horrible and not friendly at all. I am new to the cape and was not impressed at all. If you love coffee, great food and want a friend making your coffee you have to check out Caloosa Coffee in North Cape off Pine Island and Diplomat.]
