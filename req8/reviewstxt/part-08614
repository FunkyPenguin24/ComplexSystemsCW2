[107537341815305276006,100618884160687241501,Don't apply for a job at this place. the boss has all kind of reasons to not pay you on time. He will run you & run you, compliment your skills and it ends up the driver don't get paid. My friend worked there and made them a lot of money & they still owe him $4000.00. He received $1000.00 and some change in the beginning. He kept driving, believing their excuses & lost a lot of money these skammers will never pay him. These are the kind of people that should be tarred & feathered in the public square or put into prison. I spoke to Egor, the boss & his reason not paying the man was he had a part that cost $3000.00 . It was broken down every other day as it was. My friend was broke down in a town wher he had a friend that was a diesel mechanic. They got the part, went to repair worn out truck & it had been towed. The driver still had not been paid. Egor lied to me about why he didn't pay him, with me knowing he was lying all the time as the driver hadn't gotten paid for 6 to 8 weeks. I actually packed food for this man to eat because the company was not paying him. Egor said he had a $3000.00 part. I saw my friend, the part was $400.00, he still has the part. Egor said the part is why he didn't pay him, but what about all those other weeks of paychecks? The driver will be glad to give him his part for his wages. This company is a rip off. don't work for them. Better get hold of me Egor, I am still waiting for your faxes for the parts. The next step is the labor relations board. I will put you out of business. My sister set up and ran trucking companies for years. She can help me with anything I don't know.. .]
