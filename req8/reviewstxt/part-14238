[101856952023028331776,100924828444917334457,Went in to swap that data from the hard drive of an old computer to my new one. It was the best deal in Provo that I could find with a little bit of searching. The data was transferred perfectly, everything made it to my new computer, still organized. The service was friendly and informative. The only downside was that they had made a minor mistake that they realized when I came to pick it up, so it wasnt done until the next day. Not a big deal though.]
