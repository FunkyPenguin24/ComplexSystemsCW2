[101277982439570305417,100702012332272363821,Our visit with Cosmo has been a good one. It can be pricey and nothing may become of it. Work is not guaranteed. Let's face it, it's Louisville - not New York City or LA. Work is very limited here if at all. BUT for your money, which is less than other agencies by THOUSANDS of dollars that we have checked out, it's not a bad deal. For about $34 a month (which is what the lump sum averages out to) you get 2 years of representation and a CD of pictures for portfolio. No other monies are asked for as long as you pay in full. I know people who have agents in NYC and headshots and portfolio pictures alone are $1500. So nobody will truly represent you for free. Even if they don't charge to represent you, they will get your money somehow. I went into this knowing that nothing may become of it more than a few hundred pictures. I was not promised the world. Nor do I expect it. If we don't get work in two years, we simply won't sign again. I don't get why everyone is so upset. Nothing is guaranteed. So far it's been a good experience and at least I have pictures I can take to places outside Kentucky when we travel. Never know what might happen.]
