[105273238322729542823,100828117545460569376,I recently bought a 2010 Jaguar XFR that Baron BMW had taken in on trade. I was able to work out everything on the phone with Frank & Steve ahead of time. Living in DFW, I had to fly in to pick up the car and was picked up by my sales rep, Frank at the airport. They had my car detailed with a full tank of gas and I was out of the dealership in about an hour. The dealership is a nice facility and the staff was very professional throughout the entire transaction.]
