[105068333313656867552,100899137294692819391,My purchase of a 2006 CLK350 at Flectcher Jones Fremont was quite simply the best car buying experience I have ever had. I purchased the vehicle before it was detailed or has any work done on it and the entire buying process was based on the promises made by the sales team. They not only delivered on every promise they made, they actually went beyond that. I truly appreciate Sam's professionalism, knowledge and his ability to honor all the commitments he's made. I would also like to thank Mike Ramish (Sales manager), Greg Nichols (Used Car Manager) and Joe DeFreitas (Service Adviser) for their effort and involvements in making the entire process a pleasant and enjoyable.]
