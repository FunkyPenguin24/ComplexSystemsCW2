[103809333928468215183,100950407298914641014,I love their chicken. The BBQ bacon sandwich it's a amazing. Sides are pretty simple and I'd personally say the Cajun fries are a bit too seasoned, but who cares when the chicken is so dang good! The only complaint I have is that they mess up the BBQ bacon sandwich sometimes; come on guys, your chicken breast is amazing, but when a guy orders something that's supposed to have dark meat too, don't leave it off!!]
