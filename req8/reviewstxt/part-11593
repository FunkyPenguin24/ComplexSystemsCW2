[100423256843067192558,100778907026131857305,I lived here with my sister in 2010-2011, and it was HORRIBLE. My sisters room had black mold in the windows, and the closet doors were VERY much off track (to the point that my sister wound up just taking them off completely). The stove was NOT level, everything that was cooked in the oven was always undercooked, when placed on the correct temperature. The floor in the kitchen was coming was peeling up, there were nails sticking up out of the floor that we constantly complaining to staff about. The floors above us were paper thin (to the point that we could hear every single move the people above us made, right down to their bodily functions and whispers). Every problem we had we reported when we moved in, and asked them to fix NUMEROUS times over a course of six months. Eventually we decided the $650 we were paying a month was NOT worth all of the sickness and complaints we had. In my opinion, if your going to pay almost $700 a month for something, it had better be in GREAT condition. NOT worth the money, and the staff are RUDE to boot!!! WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO MY WORST ENEMY!]
