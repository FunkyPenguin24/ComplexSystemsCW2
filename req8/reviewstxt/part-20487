[102634089715012067134,100085135892107160556,Currently hating it. The staff is nice and friendly when trying to sign you up for a membership. I remember them calling me 2 or 3 times a day to come back in - even on Sundays. Now I've been a member for a few months and the club is just going down the drain. Don't get me wrong, they have nice large new facilities. Towels, electronic lockers (no lock needed, just a combo), and pool. The problem is that recently there are no towels, half of the electronic lockers don't work (forcing members to leave stuff unlocked) and the pool was closed for a while for some unknown reason. To make it worse my billing is wrong and no matter how many times I try to fix it I get NO response. It's the classic bait and switch - treat 'em great when trying to sign them up and them provide no customer service. The cleanliness has also become an issue and it is obvious that this place is understaffed from front desk staff to cleaning staff. Not to mention the front desk staff changes every week and has no clue what's going on. The owner of this gym should worry, this place is falling apart fast. I would think twice about joining this gym - find a place that's nice AND properly maintained.]
