[114465844351765945515,100480939217900627007,Friendly and Thorough Everyone there is very friendly and patient (even with all four of our kids there). Dr Yin communicates very well with us what she is doing and what is going on, not like other eye doctors that forget that they are dealing with actual human beings. Her staff is also very knowledgeable, they were able to happily answer all our questions.]
