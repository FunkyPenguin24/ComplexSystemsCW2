[116143078578401295865,100876108522384558951,The food is always delicous. But normally you have to come at the right time beacuse the shop is always quite crowded. Personally I don't like the drinks there much. But hey you can't complain the food is damm good.Just bring your own drinks. Actually the one drink that is nice is the soya bean bottle drink. The hakka noodles are my favourite dish. -John Smith]
