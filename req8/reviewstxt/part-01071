[100088407175918212328,100214275545437869376,I've had great experiences at multiple Maaco locations. I had an estimate done for a smallish dent in my front bumper; they said about $100. I wanted to check the price with another place who tried to charge me $900 for a completely unnecessary replacement. I'm VERY thankful Maaco doesn't rip people off!]
