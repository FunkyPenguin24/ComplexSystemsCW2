[101972737779211835067,100972000176910612331,Tonight we got the same excellent service as always but also had a chance to experience the amazing(!!) gyros and homemade hummus from the newly opened food cart here. It's just the right amount of food before smoking. I would give the chicken gyro 5 out of 6 noms. The hummus gets 5.5 out of 6 noms.]
