[107114360250170280150,100537940288773266084,Someone slammed their door into my wife's Highlander and dented the front fender. Man that made me mad plus now the truck looked lousy. Well I decided to take the vehicle over to Mister Dent. I spoke to Robert who agreed to meet me on a Saturday which was great. I made an appointment for the following weekend and he took care of it. He did a great job. You could not tell there was ever any damage there!!! I also brought him my Lexus that had a couple of door dings and he took care of those as well. I highly recommend Mister Dent he does excellent work! In the future, Robert will get all of the work my cars may need.]
