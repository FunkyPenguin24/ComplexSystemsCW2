[104163914028718507377,100263391178718752954,VVC isn't a bad school. VVC is just as good as any other community college as far as education is concerned *went to Mt. Sac in spring 2003*. I'm not going to say VVC have a lot of the top tier connections like other community colleges such Mt. Sac or SMC (Santa Monica College). However, students transferring to four year colleges for academic or athletic purposes still attend good institutions like Ohio University, Kansas Wesleyan, CSU, and UCs. I can't say VVC doesn't have its flaws. One noticeable flaw are the people that hang out at the RAM center doing a whole bunch of nothing. The food court definitely needs an upgrade...BAD. The football field needs a huge upgrade. It's time for VVC to invest in a multipurpose field and stadium. Finally, I wouldn't mind seeing a bridge built over the lake. Sometimes it's a pain having to walk around the Lake to get to one class to the other. lol However, much of the flaws are due to lack of funding. At the end of the day VVC is what YOU make of it. I enjoyed my time at VVC by playing football, attending parties and clubs. To this day I keep in contact with former teammates and coaches from VVC. Upon transferring I was accepted into Azusa Pacific, Chapman University, Cal Poly Pomona, and University of La Verne. I chose to attend University of La Verne, thus allowing me to play an additional two years of football before graduating.]
