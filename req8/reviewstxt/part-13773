[100346000010236298568,100899646782775538051,There was one customer eating when I went here. The two employees talked to each other the entire time they were taking my order and making my food. The "enchilada" was just meat in a tortilla that they drizzled sauce over and handed to me. The price would be okay if the food was close to decent . Don't waste your money.]
