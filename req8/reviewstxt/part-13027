[113514566338565227444,100858290994218888837,We had been told by another shop that our motor needed to be replaced and that it would cost somewhere in the $5000 dollar range to replace it. We had it towed to Christian Brothers in Bartlett. The motor was in fact not repairable, but they quoted us a much more reasonable price. When we decided to replace my car, they had a Salvage yard come and appraise it. After the appraisal, they offered us the same amount with the idea that they would rebuild it and try to sell it to someone (and not just sit in a salvage yard). After we sold it to them, they wrote off the towing fee and the inspection fee. Additionally, we took them the car we planned on replacing ours with for a pre-purchase inspection. They were very thorough and gave us a great deal of confidence about the condition of the car. The staff at Christian Brothers is very friendly and professional. I dealt mainly with Scott and Chris, and will definitely be using them again.]
