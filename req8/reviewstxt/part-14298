[111291150817167863935,100928417740232139385,No hot water to wash hands in bathroom. Paint peeling off crumbling walls, bathtub peeling as well. Room stinks....how do they not see these things? Even Super 8 has a fridge/ microwave....and this is a resort? San Diego should be embarrassed to allow this establishment to have such low standards and high prices. ]
