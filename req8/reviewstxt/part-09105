[115273954784727448407,100644900891758384549,Ordered "Red, White, and You" for my girlfriend's birthday, as I live out of state. It was delivered timely, but I paid $60 for the bouquet, which I was told would look "as shown." The product picture had at least fifteen roses in it, while the bouquet my girlfriend got only had three. Not what I paid for. I have the pictures to prove this.]
