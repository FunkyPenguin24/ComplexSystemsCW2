[111629693648222593098,100471712291556862129,9/22/13 Just ordered two burgers to go.... All I can say is bland. The Guacamole Burger and the Sauteed Shroom were both tasteless although the Mushroom burger was far better. I added a patty to each (Monster), but that didn't matter. We also ordered a side of their mack n' cheese....stay away from that. It was just cooked macaroni with melted cheese pored on top. I've had better "gourmet" macaroni off the shelf from the grocery store. For $28 (no drinks), I expected better.]
