[107251508495370432487,100414986009330600924,Absolutely horrible service. My wife has tried to use the VIP oil service and has literally sat there for 3 hours. I would highly recommend that you steer clear of this place. We tried to cancel the service and they pulled some shenanigans on us. The horn on the car stopped working and they were unable to figure it out after 2 visits. They constantly try to bamboozle you with the bait and switch and constant attempts at up sales and hidden fees. They give car salesmen a bad name and that in itself speaks volumes.]
