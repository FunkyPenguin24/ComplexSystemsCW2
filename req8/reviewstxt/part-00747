[112417751290447592718,100198206997159389719,Best storage facility around. Best customer service. Went in yesterday because I couldn't put my credit card in on the website for montly auto pay. Rose was there and in the matter of just a couple of minutes it was taken care of. Excellent service!! Thanks Rose for your help. I also have to say Hannah at this location has been extremely helpful as we rented one unit and because of an emergency we had to switch to a larger unit for my mother's household contents. It was a very emotional situation and Hannah was very kind and professional assisting with the switch. We have rented storage units from time to time and I was not looking forward to renting again because of our last experience at a different facility with the "Storage Nazi". At this location the service is excellent and they appreciate the business. I highly recommend Public Storage on Red Bug Lake Road!!]
