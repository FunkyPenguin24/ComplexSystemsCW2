[112180553086491437765,100702512817867831764,I joined Perfect Balance Doral just 2 months ago as a way to stay healthy and fit and already I can see a big difference in my body. I have dropped down in my clothing sizes and I feel so much stronger. Instructor Franky has great energy and is always super motivating. He changes the class a little every day to keep us engaged and working hard. This is also a great place to talk to people about healthy eating habits and Inst. Frankie always has advice about taking care of your body. It's been a great experience and I think it's been a great investment.]
