[117208626029062609334,101156317487807668399,I have been coming here for about 6 months and have had nothing but good experiences. The best part is that you get 5 star treatment for a low cost. Each stylist will give you a head massage when you are getting your hair washed, use official Paul Mitchell products, and style it before you leave. I am a fan of going to beauty schools over salons, and this is by far my first choice! Students come and go, but I am currently using a student named "Sam" and she is great!]
