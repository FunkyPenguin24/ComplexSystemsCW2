The guy was hlpful and they clearly were interested in geting our business. Inside the place, the service was equally eager, polite, and helpful. I actually don't eat pork, but I miss Pork BBQ sandwiches. This place serves Pulled Chicken and Beef BBQ as well, though. Turns out that not a lot of BBQ places serve that. I've looked. In any case, the Chicken BBQ Sandwich was well done. The sauce and cooking were perfect and my wife's Beef Brisket was solid as well. They offer a great selection of sides, and a decent set of kid's meals also. The food came out quickly and the staff was constantly cleaning and helping customers. These people were hustling to make it a good place to eat. Overall, I thought it was a great BBQ place and would recommend it to anyone in that area looking to support a local small business.]
