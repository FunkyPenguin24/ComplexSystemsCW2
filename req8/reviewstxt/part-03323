[101519730946504231844,100330782376949830664,It doesn't get any better than these two, folks! You cannot put a price on the service they provide. These two will not only create the most amazing images for you to keep for the rest of your lives, but they will help you relax and have fun during the whole process! Ben & Les make your day so much easier and better because they are there to help you with whatever you need, they make it fun, they help you relax and not stress, all while working some magic behind the lenses. There is no reason for anyone to work with anyone else for their wedding. I feel like that was the best decision we made together as a couple next to deciding to get married: choosing Ben & Les as our photographers. I believe we truly hit the jackpot with them! I feel like, not only did we get the best possible images to create keepsake memories forever, but we made a couple of amazing friends, too! We love Ben & Les--SO HIRE THEM FOR YOUR WEDDING SO YOU CAN SEE WHY YOU ARE GOING TO LOVE THEM TOO! :)]
