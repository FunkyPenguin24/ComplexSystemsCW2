[104150289230971620586,101150726052929324521,This is a great restaurant: I like El Pollo Loco, and this is my favorite El Pollo Loco. The staff is excellent, the chicken is excellent, and the side orders are excellent. They haven't yet remodeled, as some El Pollo Locos have, but the seating area is still nice. Finally, it is cost-effective for large groups: I have 7 children, and the cost per person is very reasonable with the family meals. We eat here weekly, and have for many years.]
