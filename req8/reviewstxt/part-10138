[104849792467918229559,100701481023210402931,We were getting married, so we signed up for private dance lessons with Fabio Bonini. We sent him our wedding song, and he choreographed a beautiful showstopper! We could not have been happier! Our friends and family loved it, and called it the "PERFORMANCE OF A LIFETIME." We HIGHLY RECOMMEND Fabio and Forever Dancing! Excellent experience all the way around. Friendly staff, beautiful dance studio, easy parking, and inexpensive considering what you get for your money.]
