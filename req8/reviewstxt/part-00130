[111935683702170924055,100165664859638323895,I've had many amazing massages at Massage Envy, Bel Air. I saw Jenn yesterday (for the second time) and felt so taken care of- I wish I would've gone for a 90 minute session instead of an hour! I highly recommend her! Other therapists I have had are Anthony, Marquita, Lisa, Janine and Christina- I have so much pride for all of the therapists here because they do a great job of customizing your session and taking good care of you. They are all certified, experienced, professional and kind. TIPS: Make sure you communicate with your Massage Therapist during your session because only you know what your body can take and what techniques and pressure help you relax. Also be sure to communicate with the Front Desk as to what you are looking for so they can help you find a therapist that has the touch/technique that suites you. ( It is best to book your appointments in advance on the weekends, same day/walk-in appointments are easier during the week). Hope this was helpful!]
