[101905831747077956805,100674620342357779717,When I needed a head shot for my business, I drove all the way from Dallas to Austin to have a professional photographic session with Kim Francois. That may seem like a long drive when there are great photographers in Dallas - but I really trusted Kim. She totally understood the look I wanted and worked with me on wardrobe, jewelry selection and even purchased flowers to create the perfect backdrop for my picture. In my business, image is very important. So I went the extra mile for the professional and technical expertise that Kim provided. It was a great experience and well worth the trip to Austin. I more than recommend her.]
