[111263363481476600463,100228595837646585654,My child is excited about going to tutoring. He loves the staff and enjoys the rotations. The Tutoring Center cares about the success of the children and it shows! The one on one instruction is such a benefit. Students are motivated by their progress and the reward systems in place. Kids are always happy and smiling when they walk in the door!]
