[118208186677120641395,101091342840209385912,This was my first time at Cultiva. It is decorated nicely and I felt comfortable when I first walked in. I ordered a cup of the Dark Roast coffee and it came to me cold. When I complained to the staff they seemed not to care and told me that seemed unfortunate. There was no offer to replace the cup that I had with a hot cup of coffee. The music was obnoxious and way to loud making it difficult for us to have any type of meaningful conversation without shouting. Again, our request to reduce the volume of the music was ignored. The staff didn't seem to care for the music as they had their ipods on with their earbuds in their ears listening to their own music. The fan overhead on a cool June day was going at mach 1 speed causing a cool breeze to wash over us and making our beverages even colder than they were. If you want a nice relaxing place to have a hot cup of coffee and a conversation with friends, this is not the place to go. I will not return.]
