[102365713324994617985,100102683085239405017,I love this place! But... Rides need new restraints and paint jobs. Food is good, but needs some improving when it comes to price. Bathrooms need cleaning! But other than that, the rides are really fun and exciting!!! The theming is starting to get better. They are including more and more family attractions each year. And the employees are super nice and friendly! They actually get the job done! Lots and lots of great improvements each year!]
