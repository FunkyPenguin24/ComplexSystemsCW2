[114415124925829231843,100864090416967800717,JMM at the Klinke was so friendly and helpful, as I came in wearing a bit of soy sauce that was on my business suit, tie, shirt, and pants. (Luckily, my gym clothes were in my car.) And quicker than Clark Kent in a telephone booth (or photo booth, or whatever he uses nowadays), my clothes were checked in with the needed special instructions for the stain's removal. The text message that my clothes were ready for pick up arrived more than 4 hours early the next day. I'm looking forward to trying their drive-through service next time, using Klinke's express bag system.]
