[102562928543591577410,100813284138372935783,I have had a surprising bad experience with Action Appliance. On Jan 11 we had a service repair call for our dishwasher. The diagnosis was that a new motherboard was necessary. I signed for that repair to occur once the part was ordered - $501.09. Days later the call from Action Appliance said the part wasn't available, but they would rebuild the motherboard instead. That was not a choice we wanted; they said we had no choice - they decide how to fix the dishwasher, and if we chose to cancel the repair, we would incur a 25% cancellation fee - approx $125 - ON TOP of the approx $60 service call fee. I believe the failure of the part to be available, which is what I signed for, means I don NOT have to accept a rebuild if I don't want to. Subsequent calls to the company have been met with blunt, unprofessional "You are never getting the cancellation fee reversed"-type language. I feel this is an incredible gouging. The 25% fee is an arbitrary number applied to the money I foolishly gave them before the job was done to my satisfaction. I urge anyone using this shady operation to hold off paying until you see what you're really getting for your money.]
