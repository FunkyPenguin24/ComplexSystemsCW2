[114373766154447244075,100541733746812503962,LOVE crossfit frequency! I actually look forward to working out for once in my life! Normally after a long day at work I would have to drag myself to the gym and most days I ended up opting for wheel of fortune and the couch. I NEVER feel this way about going to CFF and I noticed results almost immediately. Coaches are awesome, people are friendly and welcoming and it really feels like a big family! Do yourself a favor and try it out!]
