[112078870692216909507,100357656993080989748,Horrible customer service. They will not bill the equipment correctly, my wife and I have called them for 4 months, and they won't return our calls. Sent letters, they still do not return calls. This is the worst place I can think of to use for medical devices. The management is running it into the ground, and I've notified numerous doctors offices to not recommend Bennett Medical due to their terrible customer service.]
