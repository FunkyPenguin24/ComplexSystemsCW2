[102511122599819683279,100664753623654306809,Best Apartments In Green Bay! I have been living at the Brook Park Apartments for about 3 months, and I have to say I'm extreme impressed. Move in process was extremely easy. We were trying to move-in in the middle of the month and they worked really hard to find us exactly what we wanted. The people in the office are extra friendly. The maintenance crew never leaves us waiting, they have fixed any problem we had in a timely manner. Neighbors are very friendly, you can tell management does great background checks. If you plan on moving here, make sure you get an apt the faces the empty field towards the west. Wild turkey, deer and foxes come out all the time, and the sunset is amazing. I'm very happy that I moved here. I would recommend these apartments to anyone.]
