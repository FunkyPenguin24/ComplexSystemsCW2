[116117144591747075203,100870570060677777769,My husband took our dog to Copper View Animal Hospital after her normal allergies got worse and we discovered she had a serious ear infection. We had mixed feelings about previous vets we had been to over the past 10 years in the area and after seeing the positive reviews, we decided to give Copper View a try. The professional staff was very thorough in explaining the course of treatment. They set up a follow-up appointment for our dog at no charge. The vet spent a great deal of time explaining the options to control her allergies but we felt no pressure to pursue one over the other. Fees were reasonable. Best of all, we have had good success in treating our dog's allergies with the course of treatment Copper View recommended. I was very happy with our experience at Copper View.]
