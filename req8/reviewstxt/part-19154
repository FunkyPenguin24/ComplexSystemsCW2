[117042147506531962694,100013873093325123270,I was intrigued by their sign advertising "Authentic Thai Street Food," which can be very difficult to find. I tried their roasted pork on rice, which is like Thai cow moo dang, and while it was not exactly like you might find in Thailand, it was the closest thing I've found on the east coast. The waitress was very friendly, and I will go back next time I'm craving that dish!]
