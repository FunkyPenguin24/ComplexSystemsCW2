[106856246671915839437,100655448706153379997,My sister came to visit Houston and I thought this would be a fun thing to do with her. We did the 3-hour trip and had a great time. The only drawback, which doesn't really reflect on the business, was that we were really sore afterwards. Looking back we probably should have stuck with the 1-hour trip. But, again, we had a great time. Horses were calm and very pretty! Signing in was quick and easy. We got our helmets on and were ready to go within 10-15 minutes of arriving.]
