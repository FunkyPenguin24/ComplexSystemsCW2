[107903623323145383492,100803961828079576414,My husband and I are planning to move from Kentucky to Arizona sometime in April 2014. Having only been to Arizona once, and loving it, I have no idea where to look and I'm not the easiest person to please. However, Aaron has been so patient, understanding as well as helpful in explaining things to me. If for some reason I can't find a place it will be due to my indecisiveness because Aaron as done everything except poor gasoline on his head and run through a burning building. Good work Aaron, I'm getting close. Eugene / Beverlyn Smith.]
