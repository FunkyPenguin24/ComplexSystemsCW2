[100942796388815700766,100635531217485361151,My favorite dish is the Pad Spicy - called Pad Grapow at other Thai places - basically basil, chicken, white rice, peppers and the sauce. Have never had a bad experience. Since it is not near my work anymore usually I will get 2-3 orders to go and save it for later in the week. Very nice group of people.]
