[101105497347849830155,100952516994415973851,A funny thing happened to me... Fred was unable to find time to TALK to me, unless it was billable. NO FREE TALKING. He had done quite a bit of expensive [implants] work for me...all paid for immediately. Dental work is spendy...shocking eh...after a pause of a few years I wanted to talk with him about the remaining work and costs. His arrogant, and luving it, manager educated me on best business practices and assured me that talking to Fred was best done in a chair with the meter running. Fred fooled me, I thought I was working with a nice guy. Who knows, maybe I'm a problem client and didn't know it. The bottom line is that the manager assured me that she told Fred I wished to speak with him, and he never found the time to speak with me. Instead I was treated to a double dose of the office manager and her charm. I've been self employed all my life..I'm 55...I've owned much larger and more expensive operations than Fred's office...I was able to talk to clients free of charge. Why 2 stars and not 1? Like I said, maybe its me...but I don't think so. Mike Webb]
