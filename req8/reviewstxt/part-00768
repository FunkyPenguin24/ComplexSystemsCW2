[117994401371317699181,100199115504342539877,I was 11 back in 1958 when my mom would take me to Pizza Town. We only lived a few blocks away. I am now 66 and lived in NH, Vermont, and now Florida. Whenever I had and have a chance and to head north, I always make Pizza Town a prioty stop. My wife is from Italy and loves the pizza, zeppoles and the fried calzone which is very hard to find. I WILL BE BACK.]
