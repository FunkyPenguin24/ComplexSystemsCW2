[109121230632026927878,100540003934869966700,Hands down the best jewelry store I've ever been in. They have great products to hit every single price point and everything is amazingly nice. From the minute I walked in the door I was treated like a life long customer and friend. Don't waste your time at the "chain/franchise" jewelry stores - this is a family run business with a huge network and a plethora of connections in the industry. Shop here first - you won't want to go anywhere else.]
