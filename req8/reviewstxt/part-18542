[100317895673300461907,101158299636383104700,I love my permanent eye makeup Cristianne did a great job. However, it was more painful then they claim and on my touch up it didn't go as well. My eye was hurting for hours not my eye lid it was just tender and sore but my actual left eye was watering for hours and it felt like something was in my eye. I waited it out as she suggested but ended up in the ER after hours. There I found out I had a quarter inch scratch on my eye. They gave me special drops but I had to put in my eye every 15 min or the pain would come back. It was not too fun made it hard to sleep. This went on for 48 hrs and my eye took a full week to heal and I ended up with a $800 dollar bill from ER however its been reduced to $300 after insurance but it was frustrating.]
