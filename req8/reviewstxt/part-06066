[103211714848141298724,100481065402627012041,I agree with the comment made about old fashioned store and that is why I love Weather's TV! I had researched washers and dryers for 10 days. I visited the chain stores, Hahn's Appliance. Sears and Metro Appliance. Although I experienced pleasant customer service from all these places, the price was not right. As a last ditch effort, I called Weather's to see what they had. I was assisted by Jake and he offered me a deal I couldn't refuse! To my delight, I received an excellent price on a Whirlpool set with all the features I wanted. I was thrilled to find out they threw in the hoses plus delivery and set up for free!. The only thing I paid for was the washer and dryer; there were no hidden fees, no "oh by the ways" just the price and tax. On top of all that, the delivery was scheduled for just a few days after the purchase. I didn't have to wait a week which was the going delivery time for the chain stores. I would recommend Weather's to anyone in the market for TV's or appliances; they are willing to deal and that is a rarity these days.]
