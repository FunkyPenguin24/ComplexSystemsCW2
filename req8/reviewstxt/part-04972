[103019940371076600895,100421667447789255623,We had a fabulous and special time at the Glass House Tavern. We had a party of six for a pre theater dinner and found out just hours before that it was a VERY early theater curtain, at 7 pm, so the Glass House were great at getting us in earlier and out on time. They were accommodating at setting up a round table and giving us a quiet area, so we could really enjoy conversation. The service was attentive and efficient, getting us the drinks and many course meal in a swift and professional way. And oh yes, the food....very fine, carefully prepared food. Overall, a sweet and lovely pre theater dinner with unusually professional, attentive and kind, welcoming staff. We will definitely book our next theater dinner at the Glass House Tavern and appreciate a job well done!]
