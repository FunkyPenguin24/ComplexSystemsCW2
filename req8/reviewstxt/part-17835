[103927539238238145252,101121451090875842956,After trying a few places in MAC, my wife and I decided to give Yan's a shot (we had yet to find a satisfying Chinese restaurant up to that point). We were seated in a side room at a table (not a booth). This is my only real negative comment about Yan's. I ordered their Szechuan Chicken. It seemed fresh, not overly salty or greasy (relatively speaking of course). Portion sizes were excellent. I have gone back to Yan's exclusively when I crave Chinese food.]
