[108522513610074948426,100384539099229452409,I love Dirty Don's because I love going in and being surprised by what they have. I always check the expiration dates. For the most part, if a can is not dented, leaking or rusted, the food is good, but the FDA requires a "date" on everything. I have found great deals on paper towels, bath products, I even found the exact sweater that I paid $58 for at Dillards in a different color for $12. I found Chai Tea liquid mix for 69 cents a carton...it's over $5 at HyVee. My suggestion is, if you see something you know you'll use a lot of, buy it when you see it because it won't be there next time. Great fun for a true bargain shopper.]
