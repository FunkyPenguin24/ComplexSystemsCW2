[102354214815251596389,101121033480109922230,I have 3 dogs, 2 cats and 3 ferrets and all are AVS patients. They make the duty of taking care of all of my animals an easier and affordable experience. Flexible hours, walk-in's are welcome (and yes you may have to wait if you're a walk-in but I've never found it bad), friendly staff who seem to really care about doing the right thing for the animals. Last week, Dr. Alberty treated my 1 year old pup for H.G.E. and I was pleased with how he handled me and my dog. Oh... and they are VERY reasonable with the prices. 2 nights hospitalization, an IV and all the required shots and test was $127! I paid more than that for annual shots for one dog at a vet on Sherwood Forrest.]
