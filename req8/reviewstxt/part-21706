[106905269587381525704,100151031432553140055,We have been to Spinner's Grill a number of times and eat out with our 4 children at least twice a week. The first time the burgers were almost mediocre but the homemade Ranch dressing and potato chips were really good so we gave the place a second chance. The food is very average and the Tuna melt was the worst thing I have ever eaten. It had been awhile since we visited so we called in tonight for a family celebration. Started with waiting forever to be served (they were busier than previous trips). Our appetizer didnt arrive until after the main, the waitress was slow to refill drinks (we got 7 drinks total between 5 of us). The ranch wrap was better than McDonalds but nothing more than that to note on the entrees. The french fries were over cooked. We had dessert and after eating the cream off the top found it was basically a river of caramel sauce to which we decided it was time to complain. They deducted 2.40 (half off) the dessert but had taken it away so we couldn't finish it (not that we would of course!). I thought the service although slow was excusable as it was busy until the table next to us that arrived the same time as us was offered discounts and free drinks because of the wait. They had received food the same time as us by the same waitress. The table next to them had just left when I hear our waitress with a second waitress discussing the fact that the table had been a $30 meal but they only left a $1 tip!! I actually left more than 10% and in hindsight wished I hadn't. I did fill in a comment card but thought it is pointless giving constructive criticism as I wont be back there to see whether quality, standards and service has improved. I can see why they only have a 94 sanitation rating. Wendys/Hardees and other chains would rate higher in every way. Long review but they are thoroughly deserving from reading other people with similar experiences!]
