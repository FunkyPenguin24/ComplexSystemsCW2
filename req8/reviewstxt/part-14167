[101074336502377449100,100921256071863874151,Took my car in for replacing the fuel pump. Hector explained to me exactly what the problem was with my car and what steps would needed to fix it, which I appreciated. The service was performed in a timely fashion for a reasonable price. I would definitely recommend Sunset Automotive to anyone in the area who needs their car repaired.]
