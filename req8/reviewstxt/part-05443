[112548257776405364577,100448588053661668041,Not only am I really enjoying the free car washes that came with my Mazda, but on one occasion a month or so ago Charles Whalen went above and beyond. He noticed that I had a great deal of tar on both sides of my 6. When the general wash didn't take care of it he used some special cleaner and elbow grease in an effort to take it off. I greatly appreciate Charles and all the sales team that are always eager to serve me, their customer, after the sale. Monty Pettyjohn]
