[100890579707741089003,100074648808885244978,Its been awhile since I've been to Limestone, and I won't be returning because of a horrible lunch service that occurred several years ago. My first mistake was that I purchased Limestone gift certificates for all my work staff for Christmas, and then in January we all went to use them for lunch. We had a sizable party so we were given a private room and table. As the server made the rounds pouring drinks he managed to pour an entire pitcher of tea down my back. I was drenched and made a b-line to bathroom to clean. Not only did the restaurant not attempt assist me in any way, or offer to clean my business attire, they didn't even discount the bill. To top that insult, as we left my party paid with their gift certificates, however their meal did not cost as much as the certificate was worth, but instead of getting some sort of credit or money back we were informed they were only good for one time use no matter how much was spent. . GET REAL!! After this experience I felt obligated to write Chef Gerhardt about my experience, not that I should expected anything, but never got a reply. The food I've had there is great, unfortunately I'll never return again]
