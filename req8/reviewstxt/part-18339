[112719931923449473434,101147594515736421709,As part of my journey to enjoy all of Central Texas' best BBQ I went to Whup's. The most important thing is that the food is amazing. The "link" not the sausage was incredible. Absolutely one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had. The ribs were also exceptional. High quality meat smoked just right. The brisket was a touch dry and the sausage was simply average. The sauce and sides left us wanting. We tried them all, but nothing was signature or a stand out. The sauce was thin and necessary for the brisket, but an insult to the excellent other smoked meats. Also note this was not in the most developed of towns. Marlin is a bit run down especially in the part of town by the establishment. I recommend sticking to the main roads. Also there isn't much seating nor is eating at the establishment very desirable. My group - being a group of lawyers - decided to enjoy our food picnic style in front of the Falls County courthouse, in "downtown" Marlin. It made for picturesque eating. This was preferred after we find the local city park generally less appealing than the historic county courthouse and its surrounding statues, etc. It seems the locals call their orders in and almost exclusively do take out. We would have been wise to do the same as it took about 10 minutes to prepare our orders. And 10 minutes if waiting in the Texas summer heat can feel like an eternity. In conclusion, for the meat alone it is with the trip. So if you find yourself in Central Texas, especially in Marlin check out Whup's.]
