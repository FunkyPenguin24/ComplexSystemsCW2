Although the portions aren't exactly generous some of the time, the delivery service is super-fast and the quality of the food is excellent. We used to order from them more often than we do now, because it has become an expensive treat rather than a handy alternative to home cooking. If you are in Bridlington and you want an Indian meal, you will not find better in these parts.]
