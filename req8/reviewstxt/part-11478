[103700129996318998761,100772208119676107449,What an awesome resort. My wife and I stayed here Monday to Friday for our honeymoon. The staff was over-the-top courteous, the hot breakfasts were excellent as was the dinner we ate here. We did have to sign for extra towels, but there was no charge. The gardens were beautiful. The location was great being so close to multiple wineries, silver falls, and only an hour and a half from the coast. If we ever travel to Oregon again, we will definitely stay here!]
