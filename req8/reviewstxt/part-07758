[107203765369817832126,100574665535888887417,Ashley gave me the best haircut and style I've ever had. I've since moved away and I'm totally bummed that I'm too far away to go back (I live across the country now.). She took time and made sure that it was done right. I hate my hair. Always have. I have consistently gotten my hair cut and then been unable to manage it and/or didn't like the result. That was not the case this time. Lastly, after a couple of weeks, my mom randomly said to me, "I think that's the best cut you've ever had." It truly was. I'm hoping to convince Ashley to move to NC. :)]
