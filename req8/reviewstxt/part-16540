[117856799049583137247,101049137836229610812,I haven't had insurance for a few years so I went to CCHS and Dr. Margaret Taylor is the Family Planning doctor and she is an absolute delight! She's a nurse midwife and she is very informative. She was whipping out diagrams and explaining everything to me and I just felt really comfortable talking to her. The wait time in the lobby takes forever but Dr. Taylor is worth the wait.]
