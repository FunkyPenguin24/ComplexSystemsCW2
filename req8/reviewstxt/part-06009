[107657502739819330946,100477854233573232400,I love Parkwood Meadows! This is the best job that I have ever had. The staff is amazing and we are more like one big family. I think we have the best residents, they are all so cool and I have enjoyed getting to know them on a more personal level. I love to hear their stories and meet their families. There are many assisted livings' in Idaho Falls, but none quite like Parkwood. After seeing the internal workings and the integrity of our company, I would not have my loved ones anywhere else!
