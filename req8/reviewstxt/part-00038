[101225375599156434445,100161064081851887264,A couple of months ago my wife collapsed while we were walking through Queen Street heading for the low level platforms. It took approximately ten seconds for the first member of staff to enquire if she was ok and offer to get an ambulance. Another guy offered his jacket to put over her whist yet another one started guiding other people around us. Of course, Glasgow being Glasgow comments ranging from witty to sympathetic were all added in but all were concerned that she was ok. An ambulance duly arrived and a short trip to A&E followed, the Lady Wife is fine and fully recovered; it wasn't anything serious. But I thought it was past time that the staff at Queen Street, and the two officers from the BTP, got a public pat on the back for being a caring, helpful, kind bunch who will probably be totally embarrassed by the praise. Queen Street facilities-wise is quite limited but it's not a huge station. Standard fast food outlets, a bar and a couple of other shops. It's the staff that raise it from ok to excellent.]
