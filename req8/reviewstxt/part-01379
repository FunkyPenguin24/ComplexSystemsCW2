[101308873342838563713,100230209620348302257,I love Country Bars and this place has it all! Award winning Pizza and Wings. Great staff that makes you feel like family! There are some great local country bands that play here often along with many bands out of Nashville that are just incredible to see. They never charge a cover charge. Love the outdoor patio area. Has a corn hole area, smoking area and some outdoor seating. I could go on forever! If you are looking for a good night out, check this place out. Such a blast and great people!]
