[106555794880919502647,100687483905725238557,I shopped around a lot before I purchased a Club Car from Fairway Golf Carts. I feel that I was treated fairly and the staff was very knowledgeable. I would purchase from them again but the Club Car I bought seems very well made so I think it will last along time. The showroom was a little cramp with all the Carts for Sale, but was very clean. They had a very good selection of carts to chose from.]
