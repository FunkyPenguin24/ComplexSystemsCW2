[109363586098679035923,101007182504422904611,McAdams Dental surpasses any dental experience I have ever had. Don McAdams and his beautiful wife Jaimie have shown compassion and empathy while maintaining a high level of professionalism. The entire staff are warm, kind and understanding. I enjoy sharing a bit of humor with Dr. McAdams as I love to hear him laugh while working on my smile. I highly and without any doubt recommend McAdams Dental along with the entire experience they provide to each of their patients. They are all a 10+ in my book as well as my heart. Lori V Orlando]
