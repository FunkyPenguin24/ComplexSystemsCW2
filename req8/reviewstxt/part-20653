[102764715153849872056,100093845394802096065,I just bought my 20120 GTI Autobahn from Amir Dizdarevic. My parents also just bought a 2013 Eos as well and they love the car! My experience at Jennings with Amir was incredible, they really know how to treat their customers. Listen, they have free coffee! Amir did an amazing job of walking me through all the features of the car and explaining why the car was a IIHS Top Safety pick. VW's are amazing cars though and the test drive is what sold me. I didn't even need a sales person to sell me a car but the entire experience was complimented perfectly by Amir and his unbelievable passion for Volkswagen automobiles!]
