[112417904085749987687,100674186317203819486,HUGE selection of cars. New, used, certified....pretty much anything you could want all in one location. What can I say, the folks at Galpin are really really helpful. They will walk you through the test drive process even if you have absolutely no idea what you want. Likewise, if you have certain criteria, they will bend over backwards to find you something that meets your needs. I walked in with a VERY specific budget in mind, thinking I was only going to be able to afford a base model Fiesta. They worked out such a good deal for me that I ended up getting a 2012 Fiesta WITH power everything AND Sync for the same price of the base model. I am very, very satisfied with my experience. The sales people are not at all the super crazy pushy people you commonly have to deal with. Overall I felt very relaxed.]
