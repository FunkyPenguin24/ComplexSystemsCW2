[109778070732817334515,100800506510429305520,I stayed here for business at UNLV, and could not be happier. The room was very large (especially for 1 person) and included a living room area and large flat-screen tv. The bathroom was a little small and shabby, but the rest of the room MORE than made up for it. The bed was comfortable and the room even included a minibar and refrigerator. It is a great place to get some work done in a crazy city...and best of all, the staff was very helpful. I am stuck in town for at least an extra night (weather), and they helped me in every way possible.]
