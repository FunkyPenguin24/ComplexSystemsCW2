[100017367619550643825,100228524016838207059,Whoa, SALTY! The burgers were to me overcooked, even crispy around the edge, and so salty I thought my Atlanta burger must have had a seasoning accident happen to it, but my husband complained about his as well. Frozen fries with some rosemary sprinkled on them were unappetizing and my iced tea was not freshly made - and I define "freshly made" as "today" when it comes to convenience restaurants. Twenty bucks wasted IMO. The cashier was easily confused but polite and the other staff were very nice. Hope they get better jobs soon. If not for them the place would have gotten but 1 star.]
