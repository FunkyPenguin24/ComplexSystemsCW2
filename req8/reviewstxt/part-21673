[116868834278298880919,100149298756137930999,I usually buy everything from Amazon, but when I purchased my first espresso machine I wanted to go with someone I could trust. SCG offers a wealth of educational videos and machine reviews that led me to the best machine for me. I purchased from them because I like the fact that I can get on the phone and call if I need help, and they offered me a 10% discount for joining the mailing list. I bought a grinder as well, and ended up spending less than I would have on Amazon (2nd day shipping was really expensive though!). In addition to the machine, SCG gave me some free goodies and an extended warranty. I couldn't be happier!]
