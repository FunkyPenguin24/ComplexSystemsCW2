[114763833679686208906,100665256319794764746,These guys are a joke! First the guy tried to get me to sign documents before even SHOWing me a car! After a couple hours I finally settled on a car I liked and some good numbers from them. They said I had to put a deposit down or sign a contract in order for them to get it from WV. I hadn't even seen the car they wanted me to commit to! After telling them how I felt that they were passively-aggressively trying to hurry and get me to commit the OWNER called me and told me that he didn't WANT my business. WHAT?? Guess I'll just go to another dealership LOL! Don't go there if you want a good sales experience.]
