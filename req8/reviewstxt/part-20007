[100574523674443274700,100060572237829267825,Love this place! Great teachers, classes, atmosphere, and such a wide variety of people that attend class from young to old. I have been a "regular" for several years now, and truly look forward to each class - - especially the 60minute session with Chris, Yolanda, David, Heatherly, and Tommy. Each instructor has their own style (same poses but different approaches to challenging the students, which makes each class unique). I started attending classes more often following a shoulder injury, and my - what a difference in gaining back my range of motion through regular practice! The deep breathing exercises, heat, poses, class rhythm, and humor with some of the instructors, make the experience calming, humbling, exhausting, stress relieving - and keeps me sane and in shape!]
