[101889758977995120375,100876695992043129679,First thing I noticed about Anna Maria's was the comfortable environment with ample room where you're not sitting right on top of the next person. The menu is very unique and the service is very personable. Anna Maria does a lot of the cooking and has quite a few "signature" dishes. She takes the time to go out and visit with the customers to socialize, get feedback and make suggestions based on what the customer is desiring. Highly recommend and I'm heading back!]
