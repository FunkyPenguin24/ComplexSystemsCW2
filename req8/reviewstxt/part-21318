[100765244825869879467,100130082976009066886,HORRIBLE. H-o-r-r-i-b-l-e. I live about 5 miles from this location, so it's convenient. I JUST got back from their drive-thru and they gave me the completely different order! I will say the manager apologized (sincerely) and said my order would be credited the next time through. Only thing I have to say to her response is: Gas these days is expensive. Not only did I have to pay for my food--but I also had to pay for my gas. And I'll spend more gas driving there for my actual order. What a waste.]
