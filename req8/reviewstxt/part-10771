[100254846957521072906,100734721263015718845,I love Allstar Kia !!! I bought my 2nd Kia Rio in December, 2011. I bought my first Rio in December, 2009. Both of my car buying experiences were great. I refer anyone who will listen to go to Allstar Kia. The people who work in sales are great! I do not live near Allstar Kia and I originally was not going to have my service done there but they gave me my first service free and after that service, I knew I would make the drive. The people who work in service are great!]
