[101021499656629387472,101045494531022250465,On Friday evening, November 29, 2013, I stopped at a BK in Grand Junction and had very poor service. I had ordered a chicken sandwich meal, and never received it. After a lengthy wait, I asked for a refund but got nothing but poor service from the manager on duty who not only asked was I sure I didn't get my order to saying that she couldn't give me a refund without a receipt (I didn't receive a receipt). She did not do anything or offer to help facilitate the problem, which the only worker on duty did as he went through the garbage (and he offered to get the order done). After the coworker found the receipt, the manager gave me the wrong change (supposed to be $6.66.. gave back $6.51), when I pointed this out, she gave me another nickle, and had to open the register another 2 times a nickel each time. on the last time, after I pointed out that yet again, she did not give me the correct amount, she emphatically yelled "Really??", in which at that time I really was upset with her lack of customer skills and counting skills. She is a poor manager and overall, that store portrays a very poor customer service attitude (was in there a week before, and one of the back line employees was acting very immature (repeatedly yelling out "Anthony"?). I will never visit this BK again, and probably not another BK in the immediate future.]
