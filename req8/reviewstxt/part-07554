[116107983897709236606,100563628926889610774,Saturday I decided to go for 25 mile bike ride in 111 degree heat - tire popped halfway through the ride, walked 18 blocks to the nearest bike shop - got there at 5:02 and when I got in the shop, I was presented with a pleasant "Sorry, closed at 5" - After explaining my situation, again "sorry, registers are closed, there's nothing I can do" - Thanks Bike Barn at 36th St & Indian School - You recommended me to walk my bike another 10 miles to another bike shop "just down the road" that was also probably closed. Luckily I didn't attempted that and a friend came to the rescue and gave me a ride home. If you want a bike or good, friendly customer service, Bike Barn is not the ideal place to go.]
