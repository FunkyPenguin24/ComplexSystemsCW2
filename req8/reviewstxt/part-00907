[108084777047593830621,100206148019599264893,I have been a cook's corner customer for years, and not only do they have a wide variety of coffee that is roasted in the store, but they also have teas, spices, and kitchenware. Very fun and friendly place and it is obviously a labor of love. Highly recommended this place for quality coffee and friendly service!]
