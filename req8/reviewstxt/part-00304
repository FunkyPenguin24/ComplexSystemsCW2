[100395925235764763714,100175207151137768542,Ursula's is one of the finest dining establishments in the Twin Cities. No one should ever miss one of their wine dinners. They are awesome. Last night we attended on featuring Huia and Honky Dory Wines. Each of the 6 dishes were a delight and the wines were simply extraordinary. Each dinner at any time of the year has been a culinary adventure for us.]
