[105664950920563405087,101166263626378219966,Service was horrible, I went two different days of the week and the service was slow. It took them 45 minutes to get 4 tacos to go on a slow day. Second time was with 7 family members. The waitress couldn't even remember to bring out all the food or bring silverware after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting to get our breakfast.]
