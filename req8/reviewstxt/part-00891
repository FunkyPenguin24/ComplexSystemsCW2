[114551438815256242735,100205263285104669097,I was introduced to LP with 3 of my co-workers as the work was nearing the end on his new space on Farmers last year and we went to go check out the progress. It so happened that I was looking for a new place to workout as I was tired of the snobby attitude at the local golf course athletic club I was paying for. Instantly, when I met LP, I knew...he had a vision of what he wanted his space to be. The vision he explained far exceeded my expectations. Everytime I walk in looking haggard in the morning, I am greeted by my name by LP or one of his A-CEO's who are nicer than nice! Everyone else working out is also always friendly. There is not a pretentious bone in there. Everyone is there to do their work and actually seem to have fun sweating away. People are smiling and even sometimes dancing during a workout. LP always has his eye on everyone and even when he is doing his personal training, he will offer a helpful tip to you during your own workout. It is an overall good feeling, place and positive energy surrounds it. LP has changed my perception of working out and how fun it can be! Even when I don't want to workout, just the fact of knowing that I will have a smile at the door motivates me to get there! Thank you my friend LP!]
