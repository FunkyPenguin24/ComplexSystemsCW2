[117361159119862935468,100954128087520647855,2,000 invitations mailed late and delivered the day of the event. Was lied to about the mailing date. No apology. No response to request for 50% refund. I ordered printing and mailing of 2,000 postcard invitations to a Denver business meeting from the UPS online printing website. This store was somehow selected to do the work. At first I was told that the cards would be mailed on Thursday, the 17th, one week prior to the event, plenty of time to get there 2 to 3 days ahead. I included my name and address on the list so I would know when the cards were delivered. When I didn't get a card on Monday, the 21st, I emailed Justin and asked when the cards were mailed. He responded, "They went out on Friday. Have a great day!" Well, I didn't get my card until Thursday, the 24th, the day of the event, which started at 11:00. Then we started getting calls from customers complaining that they didn't get the invitation until the day of the event, too late to attend. I emailed Justin again asking for confirmation of the mailing date. I got back the confirmation which showed they were mailed on Monday, the 21st, three days later than I was originally told and two days later than they said they were. The Postal Service did their job and got the First Class cards there in three days, but because they were mailed three days late customers didn't get them in time. Attendance at the event suffered, as you can imagine. I asked the store for a 50% refund of my bill, thinking that was more than fair, and got no response. I understand printing delays, but I was never notified of the delay, lied to about the mailing date, and ignored when I complained.]
