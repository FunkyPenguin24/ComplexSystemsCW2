[111801136383342765020,100290097621987853880,Ok, so I go there because everyone was raving about the place. The wait was long so they suggested I sit at the bar, hostess gets an excellent rating for seating me promptly, valets were great too. When I sit down the bartender (when he finally recognized my existence, since I wasnt in a mini skirt) hands me a "happy hour" menu where I order my food from, here is where it went downhill. First off they claim its a 7oz steak...ya pre-cooked and pre-trimmed. I honestly think I could floss more steak from my teeth than they served on that plate and to top it off I was charged 18 dollars. When I finally got the bartender to stop playing slap and tickle with all the female patrons, seriously it was like he was trying to be Tom Cruise in Cocktails, if it wasnt so sad it would have been funny. But I asked him why my steak was almost double what it said on the menu, his response "oh that was happy hour pricing" and said it like I was the idiot for not knowing that. Bottom line, it wasnt worth anywhere 18 bucks, but I paid, and left...never to return. NOT worth the cost and hassle, unless you are 'one of the cool kids' (or female) that seem to all know each other and the only ones that got decent service.]
