[100290246738940879359,100190327299018911937,Ethan the service manager is very easy to work with & a personable guy. I have bought several vehicles from different dealers. My GMC's are the only vehicles I take to the dealer. The reason is cause of Ethan the service Manager. I heard Rick is back in the sales department. Welcome Back Rick!! Rick is the best to deal with in sales. He is just like Ethan. If you need service deal with Ethan & if you are looking to buy a vehicle deal with Rick. If Rick isn't there it is worth it to wait till he is back. Rick will listen to your wants & do his best to find the vehicle you are after. I gave the other sales guys an opportunity to sell me a vehicle 5 months ago. I was looking for a certain thing. They came back & said it wasn't available I would have to order it. I went down the street & they got me what i wanted. Of course Rick wasn't back at the time then, As you can tell by this review I do buy a number of cars & trucks yearly. Thanks for your GREAT SERVICE Ethan & Rick!!!]
