[114481046411677221945,100400342013386586141,I have had a pressure washing business for 5 years in Nashville, TN. After being in business for 2 years and going through multiple suppliers I was finally introduced to Mike Taylor, owner of Absolute Chemical. I wish I had known Mike from day one! He always has what I need in stock and very fresh. Nothing he has has been sitting on the shelves for weeks or months. He will deliver your supplies to your business or even to a job site. He even does service calls on your machines out on site. Try him out. He's a good guy with great chemicals.]
