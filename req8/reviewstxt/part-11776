[114973112703716504548,100789178666225459122,We just gave our notice, and I'm interested to see if things will change with moving out procedures and getting my deposit back. If they are favorable I would edit this review. We've lived in a S&S managed property for almost 3 years. Luckily I was able to meet the actual owner, who was great, but lives out of state. She helped me communicate with S&S to get things done. Things like an exterminator for a huge wasp nest, that took me 6+ months to get anyone to respond. We had mice when we first moved in, and a person came out and laid down traps. good for 2 years, because the mice are back, and thank goodness we're moving out. Management has changed over the years. In 2009-10 it was terrible. we had a pipe burst within the first month of living here and their maintenance man came and did a quick fix and then told me because it's winter to put a space heater on the pipes so they won't freeze. and then I got a $400 electric bill. not cool. and yes, the owner let us reduce our rent to cover that, but shoenberger offered nothing in return. bottom line is this PM company is just like any other PM company in bigger cities (think Sacramento or LA or vegas) where they just want your cash and won't really deal with you. For instance last winter my heater didn't work, and it had been 2 days. I called in to say that we had no heat and the operator on emergency call said MY call was NOT an emergency because it's wasn't a water leak. so, leaking water not ok, freezing is ok. so rude, so not helpful, not even compassionate. if you're looking for a PM company that has a heart, you'll be hard pressed to find one anywhere. good luck to you!]
