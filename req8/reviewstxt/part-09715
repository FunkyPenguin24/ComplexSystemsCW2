[109330073105409681749,100677892413313818033,This company has maybe the worst customer service of any company I've ever dealt with. They absolutely do not keep you in the loop as far as when the job will be started or finished. The person who schedules their jobs and is the customer contact is in a little over her head. OK, a lot. Her excuse for NEVER returning calls is, "I never answer the phone and never get messages." This is their customer service department. Very nerve-racking in that I gave them $3000 one month ago and they have no idea when the job will get started. My fear is that they will just show up some day and tear down my old fence and let my 3 dogs and 1 cat run free. If they do this, they will be sued. But I would not put it past them.]
