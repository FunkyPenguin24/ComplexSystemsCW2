[108819345893020653157,100105484986654048434,I almost want to select Poor - Fair because I really expected high quality considering the Windsor Star vote done online made this restaurant the most popular one. I will probably not order from there again. I picked up my order, and when I arrived I had to wait 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me there. Mind you the place seemed pretty dead, so maybe the staff was in the back... either way I don't care. 10 minutes of MY time wasted. The food was OK. I ordered 2 pizzas 1 large, and 1 small. The large pizza was lightly burned; not too bad but enough for me to notice. The toppings were good, and I actually think they used real garlic, but they used canned mushrooms (which I despise). I don't know the quality of the rest of the ingredients, but that alone makes me not want to order from them again. The other small pizza was plain: cheese and pepperoni, and the kids said that it was "the best pizza in the world". Mind you they are 3&4 years old. Anyways... highly disappointed with a pizza that nearly 1400 people (or 23% of the votes) said that it was 'best pizza in town'. I usually order from Koolini or Francos, as their pizza usually does not disappoint me, and I usually stick to what I know, but I wanted something different that night. Overall.. not the worst pizza I had in my life, but nowhere near "the best".]
