[104282567482377293066,100147922959408089812,Was told the order would be ready in 15 minutes. 15 minutes later the food was ready! Everything tasted pretty decent. Not the best Chinese I've ever had but it was above average! My usual rating for a Chinese food place is 4 or 5 out of 10. This place was easily a 7.5/10! I will be going back next time I get take-out or delivery.]
