[104853171844090420195,100332695376489027205,11/13/2013 I called to make reservations for 6:30, it was my husbandâ€™s birthday, and I wanted to take him to Ikaros for the Greek experience. Well, the hostess was calling us on the phone as we were walking in the door. The hostess was friendly and seated us with a smile and said they would sing happy birthday to my husband. The place was crowded, and she sat us at our table. The waitress, and waiter literally ignored us as she went to give water to another table, she never acknowledge us or even said I'll be right with you or bring us any water. We sat there for over ten minutes as we looked over the menu. After still being ignored, we left. I was really disappointed and felt discriminated against. I'm not sure exact how The Greeks view African Americans, but if this experience was an indication, I may not be planning my Greece tour after all. Signed, Disappointed]
