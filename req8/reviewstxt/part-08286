[108656856967003269037,100602957998564330327,These guys did an excellent job fixing the body work on my C6 Corvette. I was devastated when somebody backed into the car cracking the rear quarter panel. The repairs took longer than planned - Joe told me he was not happy with the first fix and sent the car back to have them do it again. The car came out looking perfect - couldn't tell anything had ever happened. Great customer service, highly recommended.]
