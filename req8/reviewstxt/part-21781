[109102191557308057072,100155092392746134843,We live in an older home in the Broad Ripple area of Indianapolis. After moving in we were constantly getting water backing up in our basement. We had hope come out to scope our sewer line and found that it had been crushed by tree roots. After collecting several estimates for the job we found Hope was by far the most reasonable and also helped us set up an interest free payment plan. They were able to complete the job in a day and we haven't had any problems since. They even replaced a broken shower head while they were there at no cost. I would highly recommend them and will use them for any issues we have going forward.]
