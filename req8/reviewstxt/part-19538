[102362070549798261472,100034887600634091416,Awesome Indian themed cooking lesson. I thought I made a pretty good rogan josh before i was wrong but i def can now. Also making naan breads from scratch was much easier than i expected. Chef was knowledgeable and friendly and gave me great recipe alternatives to make the whole dinner dairy free. Thoroughly enjoyed it and am already trying to decide which course to do next. Sushi looks seriously good!]
