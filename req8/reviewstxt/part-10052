[114454211983828618506,100695979551378988342,My girlfriend and I were in the market for a SUV for the family and a truck for myself. We had been to several dealerships is search for the best deal. I contacted Maplewood Toyota and spoke with Mark Swenson. I gave him our budget and the vehicles we were looking for and he responded very quickly with multiple options. Showing great teamwork, Mark set us up with Jim Miller who worked with us on the logistics of the deal. Jim did everything he could to make the process smooth and timely even staying late to help us clean out the car we were trading in. The final step was financing and AJ Altaher was patient and informative in answering all my questions regarding my first leasing experience. From start to finish we were thrilled with the team at Maplewood Toyota. At the end of the day we traded in an old car and happily left with two new vehicles that fit our life and our budget. Thanks to Andy Hulcher and the entire team at Maplewood Toyota.]
