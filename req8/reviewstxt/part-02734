[100070898949458932721,100299806263297501342,Fish was fresh. Sushi was very good. The only thing that I did not like about this place was the service. Didn't bring us any water at all. I'm really big on drinking water with my food.. Especially because soda is just not healthy and its $200 for a glass usually filled with more ice than soda. My bottom line regarding service is that my waiter be attentive and focus on our needs...WATER being something most Americans enjoy with lunch or dinner.]
