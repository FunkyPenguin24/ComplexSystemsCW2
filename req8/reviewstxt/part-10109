[106172437498285351724,100699943645650551211,I'm so sorry these people had such a bad experience. My husband and I stayed at the White House Motel and were very satisfied, indeed. The first room we checked did have a smoky smell but they were happy to change our room to a lovely appointed and very clean room. This is not your generic chain motel so I expect to find flaws but found none. This is a family run motel and the family was very accommodating. The grounds were like walking through a botanical garden. Simply lovely. Included in the $40 per night price (including 17% tax) was free internet access, free phone use, and cable TV with HBO. Oh, and I must mention the GREAT Bar-B-Q place across the street. I posted their information on facebook and I'm writing this review because I travel frequently and want to let people know when I find a hidden gem. The White House Motel is a hidden gem.]
