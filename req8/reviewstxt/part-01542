[116072532848629895448,100237954225084304494,We went to Lehman Mazda after having dealt with much frustration at Gunther and Carmax. Everyone we encountered was great. From Erin who happened to make a sales call at just the right time in our frustrating process, to Devon who followed up and got me to come in and get my boyfriend's car appraised, to Sam and Pierre who negotiated with us and answered our many questions, to Roland the finance guy who gave us an interest rate slightly better than the one we had gotten at our bank. The process was smooth and seemless and exactly what car shopping should be. No games, no nonsense - straight to the point and we had a deal before we knew it. They all really listened to what we wanted and needed and helped us get into a vehicle with payments we could afford. In all seriousness, some of the most amazing customer service we have ever encountered! We ultimately purchased a 2010 Mazda CX-9 which we absolutely love! It drives like a car but is a 7 passenger SUV! We definitely will go back to Lehman for our next car purchase!]
