[101245356471892195451,100506929366123459524,I have to agree with CJFlaum, the other two reviewers did not eat at Sakura. The restaurant's been around for 27 years and I've never heard anything but high praise, so I finally went in yesterday. We were given the wrong menus, but that's not that big a deal. After getting the right menus and ordering, we had the best meal ever. Sushi was fresh. Tempura was light and crispy. The seaweed salad is exquisite. Beer prices, especially for the Japanese beers, are high, but everything else is reasonable given the serving you receive.]
