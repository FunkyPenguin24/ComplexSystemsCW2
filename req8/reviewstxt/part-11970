[112977056689753918960,100799484414514102779,very bad place.... lets start with the old painted wallpaper falling off the wall. then the prices are just out of this world 12.00 for a frozen burger... that tasted well like it was in the freezer for months... the fries seem like they were fresh cut then frozen... then they put so much salt on it that you can barely eat it.... the gravy was like a month old and salted... and its cheaper to eat out then eat in... over all i will not go back...]
