My family and I just moved to Chicago from Texas and our car's' bumper got damaged on the trip. I found B&L from searching 'Top auto body repair shops in Chicago.' The customer service, from the initial phone call all the way until leaving with my repaired car was "above and beyond." Every employee I came into contact with was so friendly and helpful. They gave us a goodie bag of stuff when we got our initial estimate and even gave us some good looking t-shirts when picking the car up. At one point, while dropping the car off, I found out the insurance adjuster had altered the price from our previous negotiation and the check the company had cut was less than the original quoted price. Without hesitating, B&L adjusted the difference and I was on my way. They even gave me a ride from the shop and then back again when picking up. The owners seem very involved with the company and went out of their way to find out about us and remembered small details weeks later when seeing them again. If you need any type of work offered by B&L, you won't find a better place to get it done. EXCELLENT SERVICE.]
