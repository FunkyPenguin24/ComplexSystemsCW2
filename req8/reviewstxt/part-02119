[114182076405038029853,100268674802056493406,Fantastic Food! I think it is slightly better than "Our Place" off of Macarthur. The only complaint - if this is even a complaint - is that I had to wait awhile to get my check. The staff is very pleasant; filling my table with naan and water ever 10 minutes. The food is rather spicy, but I'm pretty white. The desserts are amazing! I give it 4 stars, and hope to take my wife this weekend.]
