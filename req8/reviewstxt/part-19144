[110147725482588880501,100013361785636022540,Never buy any Car from this Idiot Dealer, they assured me that car is in excellent condition. Mike "Mustache" is the sales man and take me for test drive and told me that car is running very smooth and does not have any problems. within two weeks of purchase its transmission failed, the car is not moving in Reverse Gear. i called this Jerk and he is giving me excuses. once you buy they will not take any responsibilities. i make a mistake by not finding any reviews of this dealer. but now i know and i hope no one buy anything from this IDIOTS.]
