[116470571271289438164,101114835078760935555,Best new place in town. It's even worth the drive to Maplewood. Don't be frightened by the Brain Poppers and Frog legs, they also have a great burger, steak, mac and cheese and of course, waffle fries! Staff is fun and friendly...Kenny is the greatest bartender ever.]
