[107418454671422372312,101003457730272132843,For the third time in the last 5 years, DataRetrieval has helped me out of the ditch of lost data. After some hours and lots of work, they found and restored information from my old Mac lost during a power outage - my invaluable contact database and photos from trips abroad - and transferred it to a new iMac. Their skill and ability to try different methods to get results was amazing to watch on screen. Highly recommended! An excellent experience all around!]
