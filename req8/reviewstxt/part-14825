[102829258580976602737,100958015711423321035,We were looking forward to going to Bella Famiglia for the first time having heard they have a fairly nice menu. Unfortunately, after calling a few times over several hours the phone just kept ringing. We were not able to contact anyone at the restaurant nor get any information on hours or available reservations. With no one answering, we decided to go to Sprigs at 5 Strawberry Hill in Acton. As usual, Sprigs provided a wonderful dining experience. Maybe next year at Bella Famiglia should they make themselves more accessible.]
