[117383754483727582556,100909765360522785920,I first tried to go to Future shop and the more the person talked the more money it would cost me. then they ended up stating buying a new one would be cheaper. I left the place and entered Ottawa Laptop and they were very helpful and fixed my laptop for me for a very decent price that I could afford. They were kind and explained everything in words I could understand.]
