[114262316608580336628,100590878860361299019,Interestingly enough, this is one of those rare times I have actually taken the time to read the reviews on a business before exploring them in person. Based on the (mostly) negative feedback - which I was honestly surprised to see - I don't think this is a business I am willing to drive almost 2 hours to see a product; despite my need for exactly what they are advertising to have. Perhaps many would say this is too hasty a decision. . .but what's that old say "where there's smoke there's fire?" Public perception is often the deciding point on where we do business. I sure hope this dealership does something about the overall apperance of how their previous customers percive the quality of the service they got at the time of sale.]
