There was black mold in the bathroom, the seal under the room door was missing so noise and wind blew freely in, the sheets were dirty, the carpet hadn't been vacuumed in the corners. A sheetrock screw held the shower knob on, the ceiling was cracked. The room smelled. Much more. I WISH I was making this stuff up. Planning on filing a Florida Chapter 509 complaint to try to get my money back. The favorable reviews on here must be fake.]
