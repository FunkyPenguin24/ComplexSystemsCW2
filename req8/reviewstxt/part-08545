[100771004632196566719,100615635727953246239,If there were a club for “Insurance for Dummies” I would be a charter member. I easily get confused with all the options that are available. Teresa and her staff have always been readily available and more than patient with all of my questions to make sure I understand what insurance I need and how it will benefit me. Thank you Teresa for making me feel “insurance smart”]
