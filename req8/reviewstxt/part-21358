[101504887553838192015,100132105787676334370,Its Buffalo Wild Wings, that should sum up the decor and food, but every else about this place is a mixture of trashy, ridiculous, and poor. To save time, I will just run through the highlights reel. If you ask for mustard, you get packets... What restaurant, wait, sports bar serves mustard by the packet and not the bottle? The service... I watched waitresses hide from management under counters, I listened to them complain about how they could be at home doing laundry, and I watched them serve food that you could tell was just slapped in a tray with no regard to serving size or amount of sauce. Last, there is something tacky about walking into an all american establishment like B-Dubs and seeing a "buffalo wild wings does not allow firearms in this establishment.". The sign conjure up memories of Aurora Colorado and how if anyone had a "firearm" the incident could have been corrected a whole lot sooner. I will look forward to choking down the rest of my dinner while listening to this baby mama drama that the waitress is trying to "s'plain" to her manager!]
