[101362354183229862201,100765150447166078492,I have purchased a handgun here before and they were not overtly rude - or helpful. One of those places where you almost feel like you are interupting the proprietors from something that actually has more importance than a customer. After purchasing a firearm out of state I phoned around to see how much they would charge to do the tranfer for me. After calling every outfit in town from Pawn Shops to Shooting Ranges I do know that the Texas Gun Shop is the most expensive in town to do a transfer. These folks are not to be avoided - but I would never recommend them either.]
