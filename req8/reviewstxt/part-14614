[110829188874303898778,100945763366255586388,I have tried a few pet kennels but Pet Paradise far surpasses them all. My small dogs stay in the "Petite Retreat" and have constant access to the outside via a dog door. The play yard is very large and during the summer they have access to a shallow pool. Hazel, the owner, and her employees are geniuely interested in making your pets feel at home and always give us a status report when picking them up. The facility is clean and well maintained. They offer grooming services as well and bath dogs one at a time, creating a less stressful experience. I would definitely recommend Pet Paradise!]
