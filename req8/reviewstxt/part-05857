[100088093983870772056,100469678588559881856,Bad Service. For the most part of the time that I was a frequent Dri cleaning service was great for the price you pay, but there have been times that garments that state "Dri Clean only" have been returned with "wet wash" tags on them and some dri cleaned clothing had noticable stains. The worst part of my time is them losing my Ralph Lauren slacks. There Policy (as told by one of the Cashiers) is that they have 30 days to look for the missing garments. If not found they would put in for a "missing garments refund request" , this paperwork is suppost to goto the General Manager for processing and can take up to 10 days. In my experience After the total of 40 days with no updates the person in charge is just now reviewing security tapes. Since the lost of my slacks i have not used them for my Dri cleaner. Cashier customer service is bad, they argue with each other including on site manager (if there is even one there) I rated them 1 stars because for the price you pay actual dri cleaning services are decent, but customer service and sound lose pervention practices Im not a fan]
