[100830032161193762022,100702343644279897133,Like so many others, I was attracted to Nebraska Furniture Mart. I first went there for a new TV to surprise my husband. The experience was fine, and nothing was really notable. When we ordered our bed frame from them, we were escatic. Too bad the service was terrible. First our product was discontinued. Then it wasn't. When we finally went to pick it up, we waited for 45 minutes to be helped even though we had been told to move through to the loading dock. The bed quality was terrible. Customer service was terrible. All-in-all, NFM is over-priced and full of things that you can find for much less if you just shop around. It seems like the best place to buy items, but it's not. Do yourself a favor: research EVERYTHING before you go in there. Don't just think that the TV or lamp you found is going to be the best deal. It's not. In addition, salesmen and women are NOT going to be honest with you. When going there to look for a couch, I noticed that one had quite some wear to it. I questioned whether the same would happen to our couch if we pruchased it (we have two kids). The saleswoman was FLOORED that we would speak so low of HER furniture. Do yourself a favor: go there once and take it all in. Have fun dreaming. Don't buy anything. Take care of your curiosity and never go back. This is a place for cheap furniture, cheap appliances and cheap services.]
