[100075323670615251985,100156489513818051508,My daughter really enjoyed her visit. The staff catered to her needs and concerns as well as ours, they answered all of our questions, provided a thorough examination, and made sure to include her in the conversation. Although the cost was more than we had anticipated it was nice to have options to work with. The office is also inviting for children and Chloe was able to see other patients being treated which made her feel more at ease. We hope to work through insurance options and move forward with her treatment.]
