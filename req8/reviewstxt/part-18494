[116405164850431692692,101155970931900062136,Do NOT recommend them if you are making a corporate purchase. They do NOT know what they are doing. I posted my whole story on their Facebook page, feel free to go and read unless they have removed it. I have bought many corporate cars and these guys are the worst EVER. They have called me NUMEROUS times re the paperwork and financing, but I have called and left a message THREE times regarding a scratch on the inside of my passenger door, on my $60k brand new car. NOBODY has called to resolve that issue. As soon as I signed the paperwork, service went out the door. This is NOT my first negative experience with this company. Perhaps a bit of customer service training may be in order!!!!!!!!! And better service AFTER the sale.]
