[100121807048870370610,100404933310994247020,Never been there for anything else, but love Karen's for grooming! I was taking my 2 lb long coat maltese to my vet's office all the way up in Lancaster County to be groomed since she was previously cut at PetCo and required an emergency trip to VRC Malvern for 6 stitches. When I asked the groomer at my vet's office for a different day, she told me that she's only there 2 days per week, but works at some other place "WAY out in Malvern". Ha! Turns out that other place is Karen's... literally a stone's throw away from my own business. I now take Pixel there every Friday. Prices are so wonderful that it's not even worth it to bathe her myself anymore, and Jackie does such a great job with my tiny girl! I highly recommend Jackie and am glad to have found her!]
