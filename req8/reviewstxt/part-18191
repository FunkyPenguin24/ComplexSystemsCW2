[101137782314552327513,101140361454121259591,This place is the best authentic noodle shop in the city. The chicken cutlet noodle soup with udon is possibly the best I've ever had. The restaurant is a little worse for wear, but it's a hole in the wall, which makes the food authentic and amazing. I highly recommend this place!]
