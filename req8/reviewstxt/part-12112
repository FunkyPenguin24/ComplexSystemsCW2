[113935812766958711198,100807083506934745743,I love my new vision! I'd been going to Makar for a year. I trusted them enough to have them set up Lasik for me. It went beautifully, no regrets! Dr. Lane very patiently explained every step in the procedure and thoroughly answered all my post-op questions.. Everyone else I met at the office was very friendly. Highly recommended!]
