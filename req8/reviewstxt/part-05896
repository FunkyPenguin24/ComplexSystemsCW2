[110016505670575830239,100471616512204337654,We rented a room with a hot tub for 50 bucks more. When we got there they gave us a room that stunk like menthol cigarettes and In and Out burger which we could see directly out our window. We went back down to the desk to get a different room. This room also did not have a hot tub. We were told they'd take 10 bucks off. I'm like "Are you KIDDING ME?!?" The manager was too chicken to talk to me on the phone. The place is crazy noisy right next to the main road and there's some sort of machine running across the street at all hours. Trust me when I tell you my room doesn't look a damn thing like the pic above. While the room was clean, the water pressure was abysmal, and they gave me tiny dish towels to dry off with and I got to stand in my own dirty water as I showered because the drain clogged. They said online it was steps from the beach and what must have meant was two thousand steps because it's a 12 minute walk which is not bad but it's not the point. It's dishonest to label your hotel near the beach when it's truly not. Expensive, noisy, small, stuffy, as well as rude, lying cheating, dishonest staff. Oh and highly unfriendly. They did absolutely nothing to try and compensate us for their messed up booking knowing they had us over a barrel. When we got here there front desk area had five families complaining about a variety of things. The people who run it are idiots. They should be fired, rehired and the fired again just for emphasis. Oh and my pillow case had blood on it! WTF?!? Don't stay here. There are many MUCH nicer hotels right down the street. While my experience at the Comfort Inn in Ventura was hideous, and the city itself is very chill with a lot of cool people and places to see.]
