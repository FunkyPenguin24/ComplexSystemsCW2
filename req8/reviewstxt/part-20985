[109776700743976254505,100112021669016649421,I purchased a 2014 Chevy Cruze LT. My salesperson, Armando Raygoza was extremely helpful facilitating my purchase. When I began my search for a new car, I did not think I was able to drive off in a new car, due to credit issues. Armando diligently found me all possible rebates and worked with your awesome finance team to help me get into a much needed new car. I will definitely keep using Puente Hills Chevy for my future car buying needs. Thanks for a positive experience!]
