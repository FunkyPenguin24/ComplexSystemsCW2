[102960000935634100047,101016274710621225808,I have known Dave Johnson since 1998 .I am a tile contractor myself and hired dave for about 5 years .I do most work myself ,however Dave was one guy I trusted to do jobs for me .He always did great work for me , and had happy customers.I since moved to Colorado and DJ Tile has went his way and is doing well.It is hard to find a man with great integrity,and a tile business that is an owner operated shop,as DJ Tile is.I wish I had a replacement for him now ,but that is a hard find.If you hire Dave Johnson you will get a great job.At a fair price,and will meet a great person.]
