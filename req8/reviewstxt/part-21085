[109157425389441717274,100117539371590880607,Just left Josh's for lunch and I was probably the best I ever had. The place is quaint and cute. The brunch menu was not only delicious but very affordable to the tune of 3 courses for $13. We have spent a lot more money for food that wasn't as good. If we didn't have to take the almost 2 hour drive home we would have stayed for bottomless Mimosas. Worth coming back for!]
