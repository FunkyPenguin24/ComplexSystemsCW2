[116935390413834131541,100695680900514274979,For paying as much as we did, the service was slow,I don't fault the 2 girls working by themselves on a sat afternoon. Not only that, the food was not good. My burger had no flavor and was as plain as plain could be and my girlfriend's greenbeans were cold and tasted awful. If you want to pay too much for food and wait 40 minutes for it, go right ahead.]
