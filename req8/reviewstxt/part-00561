[101698874313895724423,100188497058911237807,Dr. Muenzen and associates are hands down the best in New Jersey. I have been seeing Dr. Muenzen and Chuck since I relocated to Jersey in 2006. They have always directed me to the best specialists when I needed one and they were a tremendous help after my lumbar fusion. If you read some of the bad reviews on his "bedside manner" you will see a pattern of patients simply not wanting to hear the truth. His priority is and has always been the patient. He main concern is to bring you relief of whatever that may be. If what will help is not what you want to hear that is not his fault. Ask around amongst the doctors in New Jersey and you will be surprised as to how well regarded he is amongst his colleagues.]
