[107609783543970190202,100578581271665673577,I have been at Watermark for nearly 3 years. The first year of that, I was a single parent with a young child. The kids programs are fantastic and educational AND they have childcare for nearly every event. So mommy can grow and learn while my baby grows and learns. Priceless! The change in our lives is outwardly apparent and now we are helping others see what Jesus can do for them. Come and see for yourself!]
