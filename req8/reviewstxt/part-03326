[105795896624280490796,100330922353827386050,I came to Dave with lower back pain which had been killing me for months, I have always had this pain on and off since i was a teenager. Not only did Dave sort me out in 2 sessions but he was able to explain what was going on, and give me exercises which have kept me pain free ever since. I wish i had found him years ago and can thoroughly recommend him as the best osteopath i have ever seen, (and have seen a few !!)]
