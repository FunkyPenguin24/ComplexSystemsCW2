[108210372162790005529,100013221460480135899,I have an issue with this place. They have a retarded policy that families must all sit in the same row, or be kicked out. Yep, we've had the wildlife officer and theater manager twice threaten to kick all 5 of us out because the teenagers wanted to sit one or two rows away from us. Try sitting 5 people in one row, in a crowded theater without being a pain to everyone else. I think it is a stupid policy, and do not have this problem anywhere else we go. That's why we avoid this theater. There's 3 other theaters here in Ocala and they all play the same movies. The other ones may not be as new, but I prefer them over having to deal with the insanity.]
