[118027932766773430757,100326405422002032978,Bought a used Yukon XL over the phone with David Low. He was a pleasure to work with and met me in Moses Lake to deliver the car. The SUV was in great condition and just as he described over the phone. We had a couple small maintenance issues that Wendle is taking care of. So far our experience has been very positive.]
