[102198321877627121965,101019279000140173316,Terrible customer service. They have a clear problem of communication within branches. You are directed to a call center that promise you that somebody will call you back, but nobody ever do so. I paid for contact lenses 3 months ago and still haven't receive anything (they sent them to my previous address then sent me the wrong prescription!). Seriously, just hire a receptionist per branch. I am sure you can afford it and you will stop losing customers for organisational reasons.]
