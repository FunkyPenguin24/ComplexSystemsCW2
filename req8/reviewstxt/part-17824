[112468604259455213879,101121031904574157870,Last week my car began driving strange. After realizing the problem was not going away I took it by a local mechanic shop who took a quick look at it. They advised me it could be a transmission related issue. Having very limited knowledge about cars and never dealing with a transmission problem before I didn't know what to do. I thought the best idea was to go online and do a little research. After finding several places listed, I decided calling and talking to a technician would be the best idea. I called a few places, with very little help getting any kind of answers. Then I called A-1 Transmissions and spoke with John. Really a great guy to talk to, up front, helpful and honest. He offered great advise and had me bring it by his shop. What a great find! When I pulled in, John came out personally and started helping me right away. He checked a few things and got it right on to a lift. Not even 5 minutes after getting it on the lift he was able to diagnosis the problem and the cheapest way to fix it. Turned out I wasn't having a transmission issue at all, I had a defective issue with my front tire. What a relief. I tried paying him, which he refused. I would recommend this place to anyone. Great honest service, which is hard to find these days. Thanks again John!]
