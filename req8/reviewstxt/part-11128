[104787942417742167836,100754880696237362397,I love this place, it used to be Whineo's and was famous for being super cheap for beer. So when it changed hands and I went here I was surprised at what a change they had made and still managed to keep prices very low. I can't help but order the same dish over and over as it is soooo good. I get the Half a Bird with a side of fries, Lots of food and the gravy is amazing, my only critique would be for even more gravy as it's so nice :)]
