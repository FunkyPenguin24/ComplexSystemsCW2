[102306943846838475406,100890625725665855496,We have been clients at Acredale Animal Hospital since we moved to Virginia Beach twenty years ago. We have always found them to be extremely caring, friendly, knowledgeable, and always there when we needed them. The vets are wonderful, the office staff extremely helpful, and the attendants friendly and courteous. We wouldn't dream of going anywhere else!]
