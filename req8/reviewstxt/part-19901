[110799906412791610407,100054611328511867631,The people there have always treated me nice, and did what they could to help me, but I do NOT recommend going there if you need an X-Ray/CT scan... any kind of imaging. I did some digging and came to the conclusion that there is a wide range to the potential cost of a CT scan depending on where you go, and NMH is on the high end of that range. The next time I need imaging, I'll be trying Housatonic Valley Radiological Association 2 miles away, because NMH billing is outrageous. It can literally be the difference between hundreds of dollars and THOUSANDS of dollars.]
