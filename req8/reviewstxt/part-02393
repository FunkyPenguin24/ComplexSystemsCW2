[103817037585556276916,100282071708160062007,Right now I'm on the road in Virginia with the family for two weeks and really missing Car Bux! It seems no other city has a car wash that can compete. After 1,000 miles, our Suburban is looking so dirty... other car washes either don't really get it clean or they want $9 just for an exterior-only wash. No, a $4 wash is not the same as a professional detailing. But, for keeping your car clean week-to-week, Car Bux can't be beat. LOVE the unlimited vacuum. I hate rushing, feeling like the timer is going to run out right before I get the back seats done. My only regret is that there aren't more of these around Jacksonville. Guys, one on CR 210 would go gangbusters!!]
