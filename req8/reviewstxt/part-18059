[109067929945935978528,101132845283910863698,I have been a customer at McDonald Subaru Service for 2 years, and I have always had an excellent experience. They are informative and not pushy about the services that I will need in the near future. I like their waiting space, and they get the work done on time. Also, their prices beat any others that I have found! I will continue to be a loyal customer of McDonald's as long as I have my 2003 Forester.]
