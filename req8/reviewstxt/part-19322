[113859650946853145642,100023808074501061022,The spa itself is quite nice, clean and has a relaxing and posh aire about it. My services were even good, however, the front desk girl failed to let me know that i could not put a tip onto my credit card at the time i made my reservation so when i was paying via CC i had no cash with which to tip the staff. When i asked where the ATM was she stated that there wasn't one in the immediate area but i could go over to Rite Aid and get cash back.....um....what?!? Why am I doing all this extra work to tip their staff? I asked her about the policy and she stated that it is just the owners policy. I mentioned that it would have been nice to know that in advance and got no response from either girl sitting there. I did end up walking to Rite Aid and getting cash back because i believe in tipping for good service but i definitely will not be recommending this spa to anyone nor will i be back. I should not have to run around after a spa service to find cash to tip the staff.]
