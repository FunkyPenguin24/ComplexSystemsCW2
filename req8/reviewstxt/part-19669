[102410673234985784089,100042171246358862343,UPDATE: 5/25/2012 - I was told by a friend that this store had a change in Managment and that it had changed around a whole lot. So, I gave it another shot, I am pleased to say that 8 months after my first review, this BK has made some very good changes. New signage was very nice, but most importantly the people skills and food were MUCH better! Thanks and keep it up! This is by FAR the worst BK experience I hve ever had. It took 15 minutes to get to the counter with 3 people in front of us AT 3 in the afternoon!! The staff were no where near friendly or helpful. And my tray was handed to me with the frys all over it!! Horrible and slow, real lazy staff. There is a sign on the door that states that it is proudly owned and operated by bugerking corporation... Well, I will be honest, I would not be proud of that one!!!]
