[100101867898714996514,101126600481902989988,My wife and I have been eating at this place for about a yr. And a half, it seemed to be one of the best sushi places around mesa. About 4 days ago, we went with a japanese friend who lives in Mexico, and the waitress make me look as a jerk who doesn't know anything about japanese culture, just because I couldn't give a Japanese pronunciation while saying Mochi ice cream, besides a not very polite service, even though, we left about 13% tip; two days later, we give a second chance, and it was very busy, we had se waitress, Lindsay, she forgot our drinks, (chef concern) brought a very bad taste salad, put avocado on a sushi that shouldn't have, and my friend doesn't like it either, besides, she charged regular price at a happy hr, and adjudicated a 16% tip without saying anything, and we were only 3 adults, and my 4 yr old daughter. So this is it, that was my last time there, now will go back to the awesome ichi ban at 99 ave, or will look for some good place around Gilbert/Mesa.. I was very sad. Also scalops make me sick...:(]
