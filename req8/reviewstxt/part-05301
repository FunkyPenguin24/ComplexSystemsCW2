[108261237007218971282,100441301257995150291,This place is horrible. They are quick to get your exam done for contact lenses but won't even check if i got the correct prescription. I stopped by the next day to make sure my contact prescription were correct because i had blurry vision. I had to schedule an appointment for next week. I just wanted to make sure i had the correct prescription contacts.]
