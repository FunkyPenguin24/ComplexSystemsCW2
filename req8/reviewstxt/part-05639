[111368743711757567891,100458130628291269791,I need to install 2 Ethernet outlets (home office and living room), to wire my PC directly to the router to maximize my speed. The job was kind of difficult for a DIY project cable wiring through the wall was required, wall perforation and also running the cable through the wall and the attic. I called Mister Sparky, and Jeremy came to my home in time before the estimate arrival time, I was able to get the service the same day I called. The electrician worked promptly and fast, he analyzed the job that needed to be done and then calculate the cost of the job, It was a little high but the end result was very good, Jeremy setup my wired network connection within 4 hours, he went to get all the materials required. He run into some issues with the signal but he called his boss and he was very supportive, He came with a device and add the final touches to the wiring process. The electrician perform some cleaning after the job was done and he was very courteous and polite, he explained the requirements to get the job done and also he warned of possible issues that might occur. The job was well done and the end result was good, everything worked as expected.]
