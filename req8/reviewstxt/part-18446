[110699160592718990957,101153213176410651988,When we want to eat a good meal in town, Natasha's is always the place to go. I've spent most of my life living in various cities around the world, and grew up in the culinary capitol of Montreal, Canada, so I know a little something about good food. Natasha's consistently produces meals that range from decently enjoyable to delightfully delicious, better than most any comparably priced restaurant in the Big City. Her deserts, also, are to die for. I hope they stay in business a very long time.]
