[106367185075053129900,100357446511785646492,I have known Randy for a few years now, and I am still happy with the quality and prices that he charges. I would recommend his services mostly because there is no gimmick. His diagnostics come with accurate descriptions of the problem at hand. Randy is a very likeable person, and genuinely cares about the quality and affordability he provides. Thanks Randy!]
