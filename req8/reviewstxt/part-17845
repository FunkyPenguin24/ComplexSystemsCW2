[105610642577781109375,101121733947024386392,Tara is AMAZING!!! I've been seeing her for 5 years now and I hope to continue seeing her as long as I'm able! She's not only served as a medical professional during my diagnosis with PCOS and depression after losing my mother, but she's also been a friend. She hugs me tight every time she sees me and always wants to know about the latest happenings in my life. She shares her personal stories as well and is always able to relate. I've never seen her without a smile on her face! She's also been pivotal with my weight loss journey and is always able to answer my medical questions and always eager to help in anyway she can! I trust her with my life and recommend her to all my friends and family! If every medical professional had a heart like Tara's, the world would be a much better place!]
