[107388094411777533210,100909384654146198918,Let me say you have officially lost a renter for life at this location. Terrible service, non satisfying environment by your staff. I remind you of our last stay at Duck Inn Lodge as worse ever. You all offered a free night stay certificate which I tried to use today to book again. As figured you all plan to raise price on cabin which means its not a free night afterall. You say it must be at regular price... Hows that when you never rent any cabin at so called regular price. Longs as I can remember this site has always listed at 15% off so why would raise price because I'm using a certificate due to previous poor stay. That's real customer service. I think not! Look up my history between these 2 offices in Gatlinburg and you will see you have lost a great guest and the family members that always come with us. It's all about repeat business. There is plenty of places to stay besides just you not sure why I always choose USA?]
