[110570535755499944610,101077896998769043155,A great mechanic that really knows his stuff! He got a worthless pitbike running like it was brand new for me and is now working on my dirtbike. His prices are more than fair and he is a great, nice guy to meet. I would recommend him hands down over any other place nearby!]
