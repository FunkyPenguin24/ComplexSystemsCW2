[115654287733294895713,100832193790162395381,Approximately 6 months ago I bought a GMC pick up truck from Premier Motor Group. They were great to deal with and sold me a truck that runs very well and has needed no work since I purchased it. They sold me the truck at a fair price and I have not had any regrets. When the time comes to buy another vehicle, I will return to Premier Motor Group, with out any hesitation. They always seem to have a nice selection of used cars and trucks and they are fairly priced.]
