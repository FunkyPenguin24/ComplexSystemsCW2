[112137105061815944529,100839315747554752473,Alexanders is a wonderful family pub, with decent prices, fantastic food and an unbelievable location - right on the beach! Who could ask for more? The staff are uber friendly and make you feel like friends, without being overly imposing or hanging around your table every two seconds. When my husband sussed it out for the first time he told me that he had found his favourite pub in the whole world. Considering he's British, that's saying something!]
