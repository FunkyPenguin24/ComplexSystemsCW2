[112290037309665112285,100457804669769946879,I had such a great experience here! I came in on a random Saturday just to kill time and found myself test driving a 2014 Jeep Cherokee Sport. I was looking for a few things in particular and Sean was more than helpful!!! My credit score is rated as "poor" and I wasn't looking at a vehicle from Lee Credit now, so i was ver hesitant to try to apply for a brand new car. At first things weren't looking too good, but the whole time Sean did a fantastic job communicating with me and giving me every option he could to keep me within my budget. This is not the first time this year I have tried to purchase a new car, but this is the only time a sales representative has stuck things out with me all the way. In the end it was I that sold myself a bit out of my budget, but i can honestly say that I couldn't be happier. Though I had to give up a few amenities I was originally looking at I ended up with the car I wanted for almost the price I wanted to spend!]
