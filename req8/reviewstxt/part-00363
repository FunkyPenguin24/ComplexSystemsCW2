[107445916684965051421,100178074224111114070,I can't say enough things about the Shari's in Federal Way. The waiters greet you at the door, make you feel at ease right away. Sit you at the table quickly and answer questions about the menu items with knowledge of each entre. And bring the food piping hot to our table with a smile. We love going there every Friday morning for breakfast. Come join us! You'll be happy you did!]
