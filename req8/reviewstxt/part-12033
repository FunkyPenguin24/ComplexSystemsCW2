[106313697357318740814,100802904636874985821,I highly recommend reconsidering before paying this extensive fee for very basic and (in many cases) harmful classes. When I took my female chocolate labrador to Old Towne School For Dogs, she was barely over six months old. It was our first dog and I was only 15. My family and I knew very little about dog training but we definitely learned our lesson- research research research. In our initial meeting with a trainer, she was put on a chocker and later prong collar. This caused major anxiety in my dog and it becomes extremely apparent that she becomes uncomfortable when putting on a leash on her collar. When I turned 18 I began to work at an undisclosed dog training facility in Arlington, VA who only believe in positive-reinforcement training. After learning about this training program and what else I could do with my dog, I was amazed. I have gone from basic obedience to advanced obedience with CGC and from Agility I to Agility VI. With positive reinforcement training, you are teaching your dog to think for itself and learn to give you the right answer. Dogs always want to please, you just need to wait a second. My dog now has throat issues because of the chocker and prong collar and when she did not attend her last class, Old Towne School For Dogs did not call nor contacted us about a final session. I can tell my dog now loves training and I can thank this wondering dog training facility in Arlington for their help. I now have a strong connection to my dog and our training. At Old Towne, I felt as though after the credit card was swiped, they stopped caring.]
