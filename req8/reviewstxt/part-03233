[102399856909085355057,100325914096160146564,The Loan Officer Mike Phillips seemed real cool about everything. The wife and I ended up taking Mike out for drinks later that evening. Every thing seemed strait and Mike seemed cool. We hadn't spoken to him for a couple weeks when I find out this guys nuts. This guys sketchy! Not like cable guy sketchy. More like, I drove up to my house and found my Loan guy by the side of my house. looking through our window. No reason to be there and we never gave him our address accept for our loan. I played it cool for a sec. but the Wife wasn't so calm. Mike states,"I was just stoping buy to see if you guys wanted to go for a drink." Wife says, "I dont think so and get off our property, think you would call first! He then tells her to F#@* her self. Says he wasn't even there. Weird! I then tell him to get off the property before the cops are called. Long story short. Watch out for this guy!!!!!!!!!!!!! WE MOVED OUR BUSINESS ELSE WHERE OBVIOUSLY.]
