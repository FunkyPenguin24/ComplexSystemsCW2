[104341967946031998285,101086078454511589240,When we moved our offices our new leasing company allowed us to have the carpet and tile we needed to be installed by anyone we wanted. After looking around we choose Mill Creek Carpet and Tile. It was a positive experience from the beginning. Our sales person Ann from the South Store (93rd and Memorial) was very helpful and stayed with us the entire way. We were on a mission critical time line and our installer went the second mile and came by after hours to install the commercial tile so we could set up our equipment to get back into operation without missing a beat. Our employees love the job they did and everyone who sees our new space comments positively.]
