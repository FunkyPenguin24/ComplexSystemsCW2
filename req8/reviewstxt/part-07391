[105262952017043536078,100553929136696537145,i have experienced massage therapy for over 20 years and omega is a tremendously talented and gifted therapist. she doesn't work off a script but tunes her focus on the unspoken areas the client's body presents. i recently attended my 1st crystal bowl session. not knowing what to expect, i was a tad skeptical. the outcome was remarkable! symptoms of finger tip, foot arch and toe numbness was eliminated by the next day. additionally finger joint swelling and other daily processes were also restored. i am a big fan of omega's gifts and her wise use of them - and encourage everyone to take the time for yourself and make an appointment, take a chance, you wont be disappointed]
