[110777662924861030881,100397235644195166609,Food was great, service excellent and fast. Jarrod was our waiter and he rocked, very fast and attentive. Music was good rock and roll, not too loud...just right. Menu is typical greasy food faire, but well prepared and very tasty. We hit thunderbird's on our way out of town and definitely would recommend it.]
