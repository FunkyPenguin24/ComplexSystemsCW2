[105387836748713482718,101092573227684839068,All entrees without exception were excellent. Service excellent. Wine excellent. Ambiance exquisite. The violinist and pianist were so insink as the violinist went from table to table. The piano beautifully complimented the violinist music in a soft pleasent manor. I would recommend the Prime Beef Wellington, Grilled Double Lamb Chops with Sweet Potatoe and Vegetable, Rib Eye & Lobster Tail, Exotic Mushrooms, Truffle Mac & Cheese was tender and fresh, Grand Mariner Souffle for dessert. The Menu No. 1 for $49.95 or the Menu No. 2 for $69.95 are really the best deal. This includes the appetizer, main course and dessert. You get alot of food for the price and it is not too little or too much. You would pay more for each separate item. We could come here any time though probably a special occasion would more than satisfiy or impress your guest.]
