[113422568605915289308,100872602492336142057,I stayed at the Astor motel Brisbane, March 2013. My stay there was like suffering in jail. I use a walking stick and require minimal help but do require a walk-in shower. When checking in I did ask for a walk in a bathroom. I was also told I would be getting a self-contained unit. The bathroom was very roomy, but the tiles on the floor were like glass. They were so slippery that there was no chance of standing without falling. I did have to ask for an extra 4 bath floor mats to place on the floor so as not to slip. As well the bathroom only had a vanity basin and not a vanity unit or any sort of shelf so as to be able to place our toiletries. There was no kitchen at or any means of cooking. All there was is a small microwave and fridge which could not even make ice. The unit was never the vacuum cleaned for the entire eight days of my stay. As well the linen was never changed for the eight days. We had to ask for extra bath mats and also ask for tea and coffee and when tissues were required. The TV is still set on 4x3 mode and not as today's digital TV at 16x9. So most of the time we had parts of the picture and text off the screen. The view from my balcony looked over what seemed to be a rubbish tip. The air conditioner made terrible gurgling noises and leaked water. While I was staying there the Laundromat was under renovation so we were unable to do our laundry. We washed our underwear in the vanity basin and had to purchase cloths so as to have clean clothes. You think they would have some sort of temporary laundry. My work has me staying in many many motels but, the Astor, will have to be the worst experience I've ever had staying at a motel. For the price I paid at night, it is way too expensive and will never stay there or ever recommend to friends or family.]
