[100874665984858372409,100086911774374455872,Although this is a nice looking motel we had a bad experience. The laundry room was locked at 9:30 10 min before I went to get our cloths out. When the dryer electronics would not restart the next morning, the woman running the place claimed my laundry had wrecked her dryer and tried to get me to pay for repairs. Being an electrical engineer I suspect turning the dryer of while still drying my clothes may be the real culprit. Anyway we had to leave with a load of wet laundry that had sat in the dryer all night. In their defence a sign did ask us not to use the dryer after 9:30 and suggest that half loads worked best in the rather under powered non commercial dryer. However nothing was said about the power being shut off and the door being locked! In addition $2 for an undisclosed but quite short amount of drying time seemed excessive.]
