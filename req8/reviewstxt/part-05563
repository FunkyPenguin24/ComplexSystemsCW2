[109751648704438289636,100454146171618184927,My boyfriend and I went here for lunch on a Sunday. We had to wait about 5 minutes at the 'please wait to be seated' sign when they were not busy. Then we were told to sit where we would like. It was VERY cold. Our table was dirty and the bartender never cleaned it off for us. The menu's were dirty, from front to back. Our starter was very small. Five mozzarella puffs for $7? It took our server another 15 minutes to come back and take our order. Food got there in a reasonable amount of time. The wings had a very odd buffalo flavor to them. Also our server was very akaward, had to ask for everything that we wanted. Even refills on drinks. It was not a busy time of day so I don't see why service was so horrible. I do not reccomend going here if you are looking for good food. It is average, but I would rather go to TJ Rockwells over here.]
