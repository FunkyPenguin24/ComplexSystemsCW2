[108632809056550988525,100163165119565042704,I live just around the corner from Koza Restaurant and decided to dine there one evening to see what it's like. The first thing that struck me was the ambiance and atmosphere. It's extremely pleasant inside, and the uniquely shaped building provides a nice view of the street and the park across the road. The food there is fantastic! Very fresh, the portions are generous, the service is first class (very friendly staff). I like the website, even though it looks like it's not yet finished. The menus are very easy to read. It would be nice if some images of some of the dishes were added, but that's just something that would be nice to have. I'd also like to be able to add a review directly on the site too. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised. I'll definitely be recommending Koza Restaurant to my friends, and I'll definitely be eating there again.]
