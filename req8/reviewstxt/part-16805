[103020614310731917430,101063934009285084578,Dr. Cajar is the best chiro I have ever been too. He treated my shoulder for tendentious and did a great job. He didn't rush me in and out like other doctors but took the time to make sure I was treated well. He did cold laser therapy as well as a lot of adjustments to make it feel better. I would highly recommend him to anyone with sports injuries or who needs a chiropractor. He has a holistic approach and recommended some great supplements to me as well.]
