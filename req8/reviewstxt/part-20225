[115118229520246170575,100072006558905168958,High-end diner at low-end prices. If you're in a hurry you may be frustrated by the food prep time, but it's a nice setting with a varied menu. A short, easy drive from NJ Turnpike. It gets my 5 stars because it's unusually good for a highway-side diner.]
