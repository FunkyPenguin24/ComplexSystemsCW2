For instance, the gates will close on your vehicle even if it is still crossing the gate. The weight machines in are rarely serviced and the treadmills look like they were picked up from walmart. The corporate office will not be calling you (a concerned tenant) even after leaving voicemails after voicemails. The Management is tricky. Sometimes they are great, sometimes they are not. For the most part the maintenance team is great. Quick and efficient. The biggest problem is that the buildings are old. I dealt with cricket hunter wasp for Two and Half months before being let out of the lease. They tried everything and the wasp were dying, everywhere in my house, but not disappearing. I did not have a good experience here, but others did. they didn't write a review but they have been here for years. Oh, also they have a huge cat problem. I have to smell cat poop every time i come home, not fun.]
