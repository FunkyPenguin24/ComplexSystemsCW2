[104804909139083652297,100556789408156406767,I eat here regularly because the food is so good and the staff are so friendly. They know me by name and what I will order. Service can be a little slow, because they prepare everything fresh right in front of the counter while you are watching, but it's well worth the wait. The "Sushi Boy with Yellowfin" Sushi platter is my favorite, but I also like the hibachi ($5 for a huge plate!).]
