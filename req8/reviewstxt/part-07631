[115920172317027150978,100566996171114326800,I have gone multiple times but with the prices going higher, the screaming children, the loud chatter and the overcrowded pools, I'm starting to go less and less. When they first opened, it was AMAZING! That was the Peninsula Hot Springs I miss and hope comes back. It is supposed to be a relaxing venue (as they've advertised), therefore I do think they shouldn't allow children in there or open up a day care, even have certain days or hours where children are allowed into the pools and before the "no children" policy time comes, give the pools a thorough clean. The pools are overcrowded but I do understand with it becoming more popular over time. I haven't had an issue with customer service at all. Also, I do think they need to urgently do something about the tiles in the bathroom as I have slipped multiple times and have seen many other slip and it is a serious OH&S issue. Otherwise I do occasionally enjoy going there (when it's quiet)]
