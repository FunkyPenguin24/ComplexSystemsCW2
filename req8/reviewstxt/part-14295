[104493641159500742009,100928229036695404375,I was visiting my brother's family in Huntsville on my way to Florida -sorely in need of a pedicure before I donned sandals. Found Classy Nails on-line and went as a walkin. Got right in and had the best pedi ever. The place was spacious, clean and very professional. My guy gave a great leg and foot massage. I wish I could take this place back to Madison, WI with me.]
