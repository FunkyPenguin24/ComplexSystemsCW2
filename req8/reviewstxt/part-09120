[105719002670973870960,100645545324968847129,Food comes out fast, portions just right, prices are fair, service is courteous and all around great experience. I think its only on the weekends they have a guy that walks around singing and playing classic PR music on his guitar. I always get the shrimp mofungo with garlic sauce my fiance gets the roast chicken with rice and beans. Wash it down with Medalla Light beer! Excellent. Will return.]
