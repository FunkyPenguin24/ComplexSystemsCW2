[103382258137089907195,100810595518635999188,If I Could Sum Up GLENDALE NISSAN In 1 Word It Be......"UNTOUCHABLE". The Sales Staff & Managing Department Is By Far 1 in a Million!! I visited Several Nissan Dealership's in the So. Cal all month long. From Puente Hills to Metro, Cerritos to OC, No Nissan Dealership even came close to GLENDALE NISSAN!! Our Sales Rep REINA was very patient & understanding, test driving us in any vehicle with ALL SMILES ;0) When It Came to Discussing Number's, No Manager I have ever worked with in my entire life of finances, was as "To The Penny & As Genuine" as MARTIN CUEVAS. HE REALLY KNOWS HOW TO ROLL OUT THE RED CARPET!!! I would recommend this dealership and it's staff to all my friends and family!! If your looking for a great deal & exceptional customer service, GLENDALE NISSAN is where it's at!!]
