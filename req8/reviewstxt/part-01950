[117061896251595822918,100259675165371214954,This morning when I got in my car I noticed a "check left side brake light" warning. Fortunately I was already on my way to North Scottsdale and I stopped in Porsche North Scottsdale at ~8:30 and was greeted by Service Consultant Jeremy Neujahr. I told Jeremy what was going on and he had my car checked in just a couple minutes. Within an hour Jeremy gave me a call to let me know my car was ready and it had also been washed. I was totally surprised when Jeremy told me they had just charged me for the bulb with no labor making my total $7.50. Thanks to GM Dave Zoloto and his team for taking great care of me and my car. Very impressive indeed.]
