[117064987422382083055,100157281500321935311,Good Review: Took my '01 Dodge Ram 1500 here due to referral. Gave Technician List of things i needed/wanted completed. Took a look at everything same day and gave a call with Estimates for work. Mobile Tech was able to Replace my U-Joints, Transmission Flush, A/C fixed, Hoses replaced, Thermostat replaced, Removed vinyl from within my gauges, among other small things. Pricing is Fair: Overall Good, Labor varies a lot. Cheaper than Dealership, more expensive than the Backyard mechanic you may know. But you get Better Quality Work than the Cheaper alternative.]
