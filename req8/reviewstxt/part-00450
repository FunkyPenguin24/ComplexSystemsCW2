[111010462796181109493,100181702729325444364,My bride to be was ecstatic when picking up her unique and complexly tailored $2,000 wedding dress. It took a couple of visits in to get it just right and there were unforeseen issues that came up during the process. Despite these unforeseen issues, the original quoted price was adhered to. The future Mrs. was pleased also with the demeanor of the employees. When she is happy I am happy, because I am the cleanup crew when things go wrong. A seamless transaction always leaves me grateful and satisfied.]
