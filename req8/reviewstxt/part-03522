[103257759156213513109,100341963497606717421,What can I say about the best burgers in San Antonio? Wait I already said it. The place is clean hence the 3 for decor even though it is simple. The folks inside are friendly, from the owner who will gladly engage you in convo, to the cooks who actually smile at you when you make eye contact! My wife and I are regulars here and never forget to add chili cheese fries to our order. So hungry just thinking about those burgers!]
