[100335848170944551145,100753693261790777713,Came here by myself on a business trip. Nice cozy atmosphere, soft lighting. Had the Oak roasted chicken. It was amazing. Seasoned perfectly along with fingerling potatoes, pine nuts and perfectly cooked asparagus. In addition the food was hot, it obviously came to me direct from the kitchen, no heat lamps involved. I will have to come back and try the pizza.]
