[110294639996178732360,101039592972719491332,I bought some Thule car racks here several years ago. I had some problems with them throughout the years and brought them in once to attempt to get some parts that had fallen off. I wasnt successful the first time but a year later I tried again and one of the managers, Bri(y)an realized I had the wrong "fit kit" for my model car. They completely replaced them at no cost to me. This inspired me to buy a new pair of hiking boots and drive the extra distance to support a local business now that its time for a different fit kit and a new paddle.
