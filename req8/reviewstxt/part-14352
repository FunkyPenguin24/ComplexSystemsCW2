[106930488937092040549,100932198599957735341,For almost two years now Dr. Joe DuChene has been caring for several health issues I've head. One of them is a frozen shoulder, it happened to me in both arms. The treatments that Dr. DuChene has been using have helped tremendously to ease my pain and speed up my recovery. He deeply cares for his patients, has a broad knowledge as a chiropractor and wellness practitioner. When you meet him you will know that you are in good hands :-)]
