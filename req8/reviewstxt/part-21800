[105648929354569366228,100156261716016282426,They cannot give me an eta of when my transmission will be back. Refused to call for an eta then threatened me saying "You better not go to Salt Lake to try to pick it up". Extremely poor customer service. Glad I sold the car instead of getting the transmission rebuilt here. Never ever again....]
