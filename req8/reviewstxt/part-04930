[116191174814682192559,100419608306786361350,Adrian, Nick you and your team are amazing. I did not think the client's request for the volume and speed for offset turnaround of such a large project was humanly possible. Could it be that you are all superhuman? For more than 15 years, Print 3 Yonge & Eglinton has been printing projects for my clients - everything from simple single-page fliers, business cards, folded brochures up to more complicated booklets, 2'x3' colour posters (outdoors, mounted, laminated) and 50-page full colour newsletters. You have responded to my clients with speedy service, precision, free delivery, panic turn-arounds, all at excellent rates - always helpful, always with a kind spirit. The staff have years and years of experience working together - this makes a huge difference. And not only do you have the latest high tech machinery - you know how to use it. You have even phoned me to question what looked like setup errors and saved my skin. You work hard and produce excellent results. I couldn't recommend you more highly. Very happy with you work.]
