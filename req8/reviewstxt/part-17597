[100823020422849789428,101108395004656960449,The store part was nice. If you are a truck driver like myself you might want to pass on taking a shower here. You get a half of a drying towel no face towel and they want to hold onto your credit/debit card if you don't have cash. Normally that wouldn't be a problem if they put it in the register but the lady just sat it out in plain sight so anybody could just walk up and swipe it. I asked ifshe could take my drivers license instead she said no so I took my card back and went to the atm and took cash off. You would think with all the identity thefts places would be more mindful of how they handle your information.]
