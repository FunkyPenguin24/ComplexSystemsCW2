[114933214709063022918,100620593173303126291,Very rude over the phone. Called for availability and pricing of a phone, said I would have to come in. I'm going to have to drive to their store to find out if they have it or not!?! The other Best Buys are telling me over the phone, so it's just this store being jerks.]
