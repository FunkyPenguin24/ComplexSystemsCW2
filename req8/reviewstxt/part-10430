[109267266341543937592,100716932416340816757,I have always loved Paula Deen and I will always support her. I never get why this place gets low stars. I have been twice and both times the food was so yummy! The servers were so nice. MY phone died and the server found a way to charge it for me. He was so nice. Even my husband who is from NYC loved the food! Every time I am in Savannah, I will stop by!! =-)]
