[115805061745791702208,100314562708504852753,Holy hell, we live in the neighborhood and ordered from here... Let me just say, what a JOKE! The $7 greek salads were not even side salad size, they were peasant sized salads and the eggplant rolls, well I won't even bother to give a review because we didn't eat them. Called back to try and come to a resolution but the girl on the phone couldn't understand a lick of English, so basically we just wasted $20 on nothing. Bottom line, don't waste your money.]
