[105426489808805391062,101153112563216516961,Fantastic Burritos and from what Im told by my Cali/San Diego friends. THE REAL deal. The san diego burrito is what you would order is cali as the "Carne Asada Burrito" and they also make Carne Asada Fries!!! Everything is soooo good, you really cant go wrong with anything you pick. The owner i believe is the odler gentlemen that is always there, he is super friendly and makes sure you get what you want and even does special request burritos if he has the ingredients!]
