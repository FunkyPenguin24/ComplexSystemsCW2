[117754972990107519489,100655590772356201046,I gave a lot of detail about the work I wanted done on the form I sent with my boots (form available on the company website), so I didn't have any need to speak with Dave on the phone. I had a full resole and a bit of repair work done. The work was completed quickly, correctly, and the cost was very reasonable. I will certainly send climbing shoes and boots back to Dave for any future repairs or resoles.]
