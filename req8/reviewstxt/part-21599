[107137286375621036426,100145397283613176437,A quality, family owned power-sports company. The best service experience I've ever had. They have a huge selection of motorcycles and ATVs, tons of gear to choose from, and all at as decent prices as I've seen anywhere else. The staff is very polite and helpful. they actually know about and use the things they sell. The service department was a dream. I called first thing Saturday morning and explained how my lights have been malfunctioning lately, that my last headlight had blown, and that my bike was my only ride. Toney welcomed me to come in ASAP and made sure my bike was looked at immediately. One headlight had blown, the opposite light's fuse had blown, and my speedometer light bulb had blown(all over the course of a few months). Corey, who was working on my bike, volunteered his own spare headlight bulb since the shop didn't have that bulb in stock. After an hour of service, I had a new headlight bulb, speedometer bulb, headlight fuse, air in my tires, and a recommendation to get my chain and sprockets replaced as soon as I could(which I knew). Toney only charged me for the headlight bulb at a discounted price and the labor. I was out of there in less than two hours.]
