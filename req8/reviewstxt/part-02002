[112439271698430897613,100262648736259969915,Surprisingly delicious homemade food for extremely reasonable price. If you're looking for a large selection of homemade vegtables, fresh fish, Chicken Fried Steak, Chicken and Dumplings, etc even a homemade dessert, you may want to give this restaurant a try. All you can eat buffet for $7.95 including dessert. As far as service, our waitress was #4, always kept sweet tea refills coming and with her 34 years experience, I can see why she's one of the best. We'll definitely be back! However, next time I'll try not to eat everything on the buffet. Time for a much needed run. :)]
