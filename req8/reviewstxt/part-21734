[103623811125486945974,100152686191581603241,As a regular movie go-er, I like this Cinema because you can park very close for free as the cinema covers the cost of a 3 hour slot. Furthermore, there are plenty of screens and generally a good choice except at term time when the kids are off school. I particularly like the Imex Large Hi-Def screen and sound and the 3D is something else. As normal with cinemas, drinks and snacks are over priced. In very cold weather some of the screens can be a bit chilly.]
