[102283138927151895202,100981346171769448179,My work started with Jesse James when a chiropractor said there wasn't much more he could do for me after seeing me for over a year. I had been through 2 chiropractors before that, and a variety of other specialists, none of whom could put a dent in my chronic back problems. Within 5 sessions, Jesse James had taught me how to heal myself. He taught me the principles and techniques for getting my muscles to finally release after years of dysfunction. Not only am I eternally grateful for what he taught me, I just so appreciate Jesse's level of integrity, ethics, and personal care. He is an excellent communicator, a consummate professional committed to continual learning, and a knowledgeable and insightful practitioner. I cannot recommend his practice more highly, and have referred many friends to him already!]
