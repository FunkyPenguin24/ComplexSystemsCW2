[113726861238498875072,101046819931332497080,I have used Champion Trophy for two very different awards/recognition projects at my work and I have been extremely pleased with the results. Even better than me being happy with them, my boss and the recipients of the recognitions also loved what they received. Paul at Champion Trophy was very helpful and accommodating while I was trying to decide what award design to use for our first project. He even brought samples of the crystal awards to me at work to see in person. The result was a very classy and perfectly executed set of awards. For our second project, Paul helped me find the best mugs at the best prices to engrave for my staff. These turned out great and my employees loved them! Kudos to Champion Trophy for service and quality. Gawain Douglas, Director Production & Design, Learning A-Z]
