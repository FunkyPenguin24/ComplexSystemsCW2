[104866700653961414691,100950095030509655031,I work at this location and I want everyone to know that the staff there does care about what you get and how much you pay. I've been there for half a year now and have had no problems. We are always striving to update and improve your experience and help you with anything you need! We have one of the largest Magic followings in the area and are able to get what you need even if we don't have it. The most important thing to me and the store is not just profits, but establishing a community where gamers and card players can enjoy themselves. Which is there! Drinks, Snacks, and Tables for anyone to use and Video Games and Cards for those looking to take it home! Saying bad things about a store you haven't really gotten to experience is only displaying your lack of consideration and ignorance... Also side note! We do give the largest return on product to help you afford the games you haven't tried, or are soon to be released~]
