[107785353002909529408,100046058357460666816,My in-laws came here when they lived here, growing up. We visited (some 15 years later) this weekend and was not impressed. It was great seeing some people that the family knew! The restrooms were filthy. They have not been cleaned properly for some time. The tables were sticky and dirty. Our order taker was very pleasant and a nice person, just seemed a bit overwhelmed with the few tables she had. She was not able to keep up with the needs of the 5 of us. I would expect seafood to be fresh (Branford IS on the water....) and yet I bet I could have got Clams that were either fresh or not over cooked in Omaha. They were tough, tasteless and not fresh. I sent the margarita back, it was the worst mix I have ever tasted! This will not be a place that we stop at again. We spent too much money for this experience...]
