[101961563353400195435,100853117414923581530,I have had the honor and pleasure of working with Denise for 7 years. She is pleasant, reliable and extremely diligent in helping all of her co-workers with any task at hand. Denise always looks to take the initiative, offering her insight on how we can improve productivity within our office and maintain the highest level of patient care. I find Denise to be very professional and I know first hand that I can depend on her to be punctual and attentive to the needs of the patients and staff. She is a true asset to our team.]
