[117551610123136921790,100475075319511624445,I first came across Zephoria when I worked at Varsity Spirit Fashions, a renown cheerleading and dance company, in Memphis, TN. Zephoria assisted me in brainstorming, creating, tracking and programming a state of the art Wordpress blog, The Varsity Sideline, for Varsity. After working at Varsity, I started a non-profit organization called Be Free Revolution. Because of the incredible work ethic, customer service, efficiency, innovative mindsets and superb team oriented staff, I knew I only wanted to work with Zephoria with my non-profit. When I told Dan Noyes, who we worked with from Zephoria, about my wanting to start BFR, an organization working to help others help themselves globally (specifically in Africa), he instantly supported me and wanted to see how he could help! This just shows how they cared about us as people and not just as a client. At BFR, they helped us brainstorm, host and program our website befreerevolution.org. I do not have enough words of praise for this company. I worked closely with Dan Noyes, and I always felt he had our organization's very best interest at heart. He treated us like family and not just a client. We trust him and, therefore, Zephoria implicitly and they never steered us wrong. The communication level was impeccable and I felt they really listened to our ideas and innovated our technology, based on our needs and wants for our brand. Their company exudes high character and integrity, which is worth more than money can buy. If you are considering Zephoria you will not be let down and I can guarantee they will exceed all your expectations. Lacey Stluka Co-Founder Be Free Revolution]
