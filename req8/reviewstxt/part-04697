[116948921751226096160,100408859160283739481,I made a reservation for two nights for staying in BR for work - Monday and Tuesday. On Monday morning, I was informed that I did not need to stay in BR those 2 nights. I went on line and canceled the reservation. Received a credit on my credit card for one night - and a notice that I had to cancel by 4PM the day before (Sunday) or they would apply their policy "PENALTY" of one night since I canceled Monday morning, and not Sunday by 4PM. I am exceedingly annoyed -- and I have a "POLICY" of not paying for something I didn't use. PLEASE don't use this Residence Inn. They are not customer friendly........]
