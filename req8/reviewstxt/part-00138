[107924187829053881446,100166098802757493053,I called HC Blake and they were out first thing the next morning. Our air conditioner that was barely working was like new. Preston was great! He was nice and courteous even with our two 100 lb. German Shepards. I would recommend HC Blake to anyone. They have put a sign in our yard!]
