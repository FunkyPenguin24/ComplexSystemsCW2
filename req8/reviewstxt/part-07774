[106179373688766765711,100575454565246196958,I cannot think of a better place to go if one finds themselves hungry in West Philadelphia. Desi Chaat House is fast--its fresh and healthy--and its a value! One order of chaat is at least 2-3 meals at at ~$7.50, so its perfect if you've got some romantic company. That being said, the only thing you should be wary of is post-meal.Onion breath is a reality. Prepare accordingly.]
