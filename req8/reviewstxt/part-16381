[115446909477982994159,101041218391607942304,DO NOT USE this company. I booked this company through work earlier this summer. They were coming to meet me at a storage locker at 10:00 am. They showed up an hour and half late for the job. When I called the office the guy who answered the phone was extremely rude. He said they never guaranteed the 10 am time and that it was my responsibility to call in that morning. Apparently they had booked the truck on another job at the same time. The drivers were really great. When they dropped off the boxes they said that they company would likely give us a discount on the move. When I called back the guy on the phone gave me tons of attitude, said they wouldn't give me any discount and then slammed the phone down in the middle of one of my questions. I've had several friends with similar terrible experiences since sharing mine. DO NOT USE this company.]
