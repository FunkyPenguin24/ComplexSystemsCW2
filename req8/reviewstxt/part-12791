[112034126776551296282,100845138372377426904,LOVE this place. All of the staff are so nice and friendly. Everything is so new and clean. I have had nothing but great experiences here. DDS Kapadia is the nicest lady you'll ever meet and every visit is personal. She remembers you and your stories, asks about your family, etc... She's also GREAT at what she does. Cavity fillings are no longer scary; she makes them a breeze! Even after we moved 30 minutes away, I was unwilling to find a new dentist. Kirk Family Dentistry is worth the drive!]
