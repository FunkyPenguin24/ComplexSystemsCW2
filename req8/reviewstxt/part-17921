[112843559171459389593,101124698869794983763,We really enjoyed the vacation home. This was our first time trying a vacation home instead of staying on Disney property. I really enjoyed staying in the home a lot more. We came in on a Sunday went to Walmart (should have gone to Target instead) right away and stocked up for the week then enjoyed the home the rest of the day. We packed a lunch and drove an hour to Cocoa beach the first day and enjoyed the sun and ocean.The next 4 days we hit the Disney parks in the morning after a big home cooked breakfast. At around 1pm we went back to the home for a big home cooked lunch then after a nap headed back to the park until it closed. This was great for avoiding the heavy crowds and long lines and if you've eaten at Disney before you know the food is often expensive and mostly low quality (minus a few restaurants). The vacation home itself was amazing. It perfectly matched the photo's online in cleanliness and even decor. The home we stayed in had a nice projection home theater room that would have been super amazing, but the technology was lacking. The projector was only SD capable and had RCA only inputs so I couldn't hookup a blue ray player nor my PS3 using HDMI. It did have a DVD player and we were able to watch movies and the TV was clear. The stereo system was fantastic and picked up local radio stations well. Don't try to get sound out of the speakers by the pool. After days of searching we finally called the office to found out how to turn them on and it turns out the owners disabled them. I can understand why with the houses being so close together. Speaking of which the neighborhood was nice on our visit, the streets are very narrow and the houses are right on top of each other, but it wasn't a problem. We will be staying with them in the future and would recommend them to friends and family. Great job All Star and thank you for an enjoyable vacation home away from home!]
