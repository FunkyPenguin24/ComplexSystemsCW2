[109419121629587360959,100816133012820685723,My wife's 2002 Lexus RX300 had 158,000 well used miles, ran well but looked its age. After a consult with Brian and Body Works, we made the decision to have them do a cosmetic makeover.After some paintwork, trim work, new leather arm rests, and detailing, the car looked brand new. My wife originally wanted a new car but now is pleased to have a car she knows and looks as new as the day she bought it. Thanks Body Works Plus.]
