[107287575848292088078,100540692678930746509,After my car was totaled, I looked at many different vehicles trying to decide whether to buy new or used or to lease. I narrowed it down to a Hyundai Elantra Limited and decided to lease. After visiting several dealerships in and around Nashville I was not impressed with any of them. Even after I told them I had sold cars for 12 years and Hyundais for 6 years, most still tried to give me a sales pitch that I knew was not true. The owner of the dealership where I had retired from told me to go to Southeast Signature in Murfreesboro and they would take care of me. I went there and I am happy to say it was the best car purchasing experience I have had. From the salesman Josh, the sales manager Tony, the finance person Rob to the owner Dave Harris, my wife and I were treated like close friends or family. There was no pressure to buy what was on the lot(they did not have the color I wanted). They did a search and found me one. It was the easiest purchase I have made, There was no haggling back and forth. they asked some questions to find out what my needs were and came back with their best price, which much lower than any of the competition and included more miles per year. I would highly recommend anyone looking to buy a car, especially a Hyundai or Volkswagon to go to Southeast Signature in Murfreesboro and give them a chance to show you how an automobile dealership can take you through a car buying experience and win your business the RIGHT way.]
