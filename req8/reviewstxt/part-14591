[106078683862825863893,100944812467634980372,As anyone can tell, that's a handlebar mustache: not a unibrow. This is my favorite place in Cleveland. The owner is awesome. The employees are awesome. The crowd is awesome. The music is awesome. This is one of the few places people still show up to hear music, and they don't leave when their friend's band is done playing. This is the kind of place where you feel like you have a stake in what goes on. So the people pretty much police themselves without having to be told to not be jerks.]
