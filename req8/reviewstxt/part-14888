[101609438727952072407,100961371177809628838,I can't comment on its authenticity (I'm not overly experienced with Indian food), but I can comment on its deliciousness! The buffet was perfect--everything was fresh and I wanted seconds of everything I tried. Even my boyfriend who is rather picky enjoyed it lots. The staff were also all very nice and helpful, and the d√©cor was pleasant. We will definitely be returning, especially since the weekend lunch buffet is only $10!]
