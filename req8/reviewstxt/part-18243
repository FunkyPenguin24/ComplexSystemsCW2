[101166167675147767356,101142971776131197678,My wife and I went to Toyota of Tampa Bay for oil change for her Scion Xb, while waiting we I decided to go and look at the cars and ask a couple of questions so we had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Bob Novak and to make a long story short we got there in one car ended up going home in 2. He was very courteous and professional. The service that was provided to us was excellent. All the staff there is very professional. It was the first time we ever went there to get the oil changed from now on that is where I'll be going. Thank you all for all of your hard and great work!!!!]
