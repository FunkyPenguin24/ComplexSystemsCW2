[105441645188674983874,100046570220538597609,My daughter has been attending Phx Prep Preschool for 3 years. I am very pleased with the teachers, Center, and Ms. Margot. I couldn't be happier!!! The teachers are very loving and really do educate the children in a fun way. I get compliments all the time from family and friend saying how smart my daughter is! The Center is always getting something new or upgraded. Not a week goes by that I don't notice wonderful new changes. Ms. Margot is always in the office to greet me in the morning and tell me how my daughter's day was in the evening. The only sad thing is they don't have a Kindergarten.]
