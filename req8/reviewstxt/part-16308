[107574037944758111699,101036810016506447281,I took my truck here for service and after I left I did not check out the truck, but later that night I noticed the passenger side had been scratched from what looked like a bumper from another vehicle. I was worried that the fact that I did not check out the truck before I left they would give me a hard time about it. The manager took a look at it and did the right thing. I believe this company lives up to there mission statement, they exceeded my expectations and provided excellent service. Will use again and recommend to others. Thanks for a job well done.]
