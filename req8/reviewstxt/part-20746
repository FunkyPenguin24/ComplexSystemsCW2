[111391548349455088243,100099149416708929118,I got my haircut from a lady named Olesya. She did a good job with the cut itself (aside from cutting my hair a bit too short in one area that has a pretty wicked cowlick). She was very attentive to detail, and spend a good amount of time straightening, tapering, and in general making sure it looked as good as it could. For this 20 minute cut, I was charged $19 (plus tip, of course). I thought that was a bit pricey, since I have gotten comparable cuts in the same area for $13. The extra $6 probably won't break the bank for anyone, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the service I received in the two establishments. So, while I have no specific beefs with my experiences at Gio's, I think there are better options out there.]
