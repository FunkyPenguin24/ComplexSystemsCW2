[105451747319083577269,100722479224424464560,Great place to enjoy a beer and whatever sports game is on. Went to Iron Hill to watch the Eagles game and it was surprisingly not too crowded. I sat down with a friend and our server was named "Chris", he was great. He went above and beyond what we asked for and if we had a question about a beer he was there with an answer. I enjoyed some of the special IPA's that they had. Got wings and spicy chicken tacos...both were great. All and all not badly priced got 5 beers and food and the bill came out to be $50. Highly recommend going for a night out.]
