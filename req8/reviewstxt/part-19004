[107205897104625897156,100006141434088293323,Josh at PDXinspections knocked it out of the park. I wanted to move fast on a used car and needed someone who could look at it ASAP. After filling out the work order form at midnight I heard back from him early the next morning. He was amenable to meeting me near work and had already started inspecting the car before I even got there. After some conversation and looking over the car together he spent about an hour and got the inspection report back to me right away. The price was superlative, the friendliness level was super high, and the inspection was so thorough that I could tell he had gone over the whole car with a fine toothed comb. Highly recommended for a quick turn-around, low price, high quality inspection. Thanks PDXinspection, you made my day.]
