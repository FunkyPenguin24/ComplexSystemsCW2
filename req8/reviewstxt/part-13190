[109164146117197008003,100867527289627234195,Certainly not the best Newbury Comics store I've been to. Took them 10 minutes to help me get what I needed. When someone did come to me and I asked for a "8.5 women size" pair of shoes for a gift, she arrogantly said "then pick up the one you want and give it to me." Then returned with a size 8.5 men's shoes (too bad I did not notice her error until the next day only), and when at the cashier he offered me a gift receipt, which I said yes to...and he forgot to print it. Really not a good service this time around!]
