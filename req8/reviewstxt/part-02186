[109460869527148906894,100271831975334657215,We have just come back from Phuket, and we loved the stay at Aquamarine Resort, Kamala Beach. The resort has a wonderful property. The swimming pools have an awesome view and the swim-up bar is indeed very exciting. The Delux Seaview rooms are done up well. The staff is extremely polite and helpful. I would love to visiit the resort again..!!!]
