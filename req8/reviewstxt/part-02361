[106159861586973706061,100280343343075617956,Just not comfortable with her style. She is a testing maniac. Care was decent but both times I brought my kids in and she referred them for other tests, completely unrelated to the reason that I brought them in "just to be sure". She is a milk Nazi - like she's getting a kickback from the dairy board. Wants no juice of any kind, even 100% or diluted. How realistic is that? I agree with the other reviewer that she doesn't seem to really want to work with you as a parent. She lays down the standard medical protocol and that's that. I left both times with a vague feeling that she was looking for billable issues too. Probably wasn't but that's the aftertaste of the visits. I think she provides decent care. It's just a bedside manner/style issue. My other peds seemed more open to working with me as a partner in my children's care. I like that. I'm comfortable with that and I will be looking for another pediatrician who provides that.]
