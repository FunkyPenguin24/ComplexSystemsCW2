[101338499247480316786,100931982532652410611,I was pleasantly surprised and how much I liked John's City Diner! I knew that I would enjoy them because their restaurant catered lunch to my employer and I decided that I would go to check out some other things on their menu. Their Chicken and Waffles is amazing and could put Gladys Knight's to shame. Very friendly staff, relaxed restaurant, great food... a gem that Birmingham has to offer!]
