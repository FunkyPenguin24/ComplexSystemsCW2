[102343331512826387756,100667726440094524629,My first taste of San Francisco was at the Frjtz location in the Mission District. Their crepes and burgers are good, but their fries are where it's at. Add some of the dips (the chipotle and strawberry mayo especially) and you can make a meal out of just those!]
