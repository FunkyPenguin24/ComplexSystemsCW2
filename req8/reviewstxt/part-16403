[105090222996689163168,101042078630030158933,We were so disappointed by our "stay". (We ended up moving our two small children to another hotel at 11pm!!!) As we were checking in, we over heard another guest asking when the air conditioning would be fixed. I asked if the air was broken on our floor and she said "yes, but they are working on it." (It's over 100 degrees outside, mind you) We were approaching bedtime for our little ones so I asked if we could be moved to a floor that had air conditioning that still worked. She huffed and puffed a little bit and finally told us that we would only be able to get a room with one bed instead of two. I reluctantly agreed since it was getting so late... so long as it had air... When we arrived in our room, there were indeed two beds which indicates that she was trying to just make us change our mind about changing floors... however... the room was 81 degrees with the air running. I called down and asked if they were going to be able to fix it because if not, we needed to leave immediately so that our children could sleep. They said they were working on it and they'd find us a fan in the mean time. Finally, two hours later, I'd had enough. The room was still 81 degrees, we had NO fan, and my children were sweaty and unable to sleep. We were miserable. We called down and asked if we could get refund and they assured us that we would. We finally checked in to the Marriot Courtyard at 11 pm for only $20 more... It was cool, clean and amazingly comfortable. We only wish we'd done it sooner. As of now, we've yet to be refunded for the MISERABLE time we had there... I cannot say it loud enough... DO NOT STAY AT THIS MOTEL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]
