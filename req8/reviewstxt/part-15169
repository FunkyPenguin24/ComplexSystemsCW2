[106901986640042734884,100975321747685814097,About two weeks ago I cashed in my free 30 minute massage - compliments of Golds gym - and I have to say, it wasn't worth the time. Being free I anticipated a service to be subpar, which it was, but I didn't expect the atmosphere to be as poor as it was. So poor in fact I posted a picture to instagram before the massage even started, with the label " looks like the set from American Horror Story." Aside from this, my masseuse was not happy about being there. It was 25 minutes from the time I walked in the room before undressing, to the time I left, fully clothed. There was also a small problem with the amount of lotion supply she had available to her. She stopped multiple times to unscrew the lotion bottle to scrap for more or hit the bottle against her hand. This might not be her fault if they were short a bottle or two but it was distracting. I can not comment on any other service. The young women working at the counter was very friendly and the rest of the salon was very tidy and well managed. I would go back to try a different service but I wouldn't pay for a massage with the room being how it was.]
