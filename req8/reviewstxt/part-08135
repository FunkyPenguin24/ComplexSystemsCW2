[100136670383173393720,100594571485758986706,I can't pass up a good cheese plate and artisanal cocktail, so The Cellar is kinda perfect. In the basement of Beecher's Cheese shop, this place is a little pricey but the food is well worth it. The staff is very knowledgable about all the food, especially the specialty cheese. Every night features a different cheese plate or cocktail for happy hour. Go early for Happy Hour and to beat the crowd. It's basement and bigger than most venues but still not huge and it gets packed fast.]
