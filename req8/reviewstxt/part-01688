[115120856771831295139,100247170982329123713,This is an outstanding shop and I can't BELIEVE its in Boulder, Colorado. WHAT a gem! They specialize in natural fibers and have the best of the best fabrics from all over the world. Its a great resource for art quilters as they have probably every shade of cotton batik ever made and in lots of designs too. They teach classes too, incase you want to sew with the gorgeous silks and wools but are intimidated. They have a FABULOUS mountain retreat where you can go to stitch and enjoy the view and great company too. If you are a fabric person at all, this place is not to be missed.]
