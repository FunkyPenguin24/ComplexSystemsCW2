[111433323834226450072,100070900216898788093,Two years post-operation for Bunion surgery I'm having nothing but trouble with my foot. Bunion is back along with severe Morton's Neuroma. The Doctor Carreira was very handsome and pleasant. Hospital aftercare was atrocious (they sent me home with the wrong boot and I ended up with a terrible infection in my foot.) Visiting this office is a nightmare as the front office staff are very disrespectful and blatantly rude. I suggest that you seek a second opinion before you undergo surgery with this doctor.]
