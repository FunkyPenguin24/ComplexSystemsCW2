[102546809966838164549,100120039613869774132,I've really got to hand it to the team at Ourisman Chantilly Kia. Due to my past, I never expected to be able to own a newer used car, let alone a brand new car. I had specific needs for equipment that I need to carry and after a few possibilities my salesperson, Patrick Garland, narrowed it down and found me a perfect vehicle. Not only was Patrick knowledgeable, he was not pushy in any way. With the help of Emmad, I was able to get great financing and I can proudly say that I am an owner of a brand new 2013 Kia Forte Hatchback!!! Thanks you to everyone at Ourisman Chantilly Kia!]
