[102811776157862184657,100550191935119686136,My dog was hit by a car today and this was the closest animal hospital to me that offered emergency services. They told me to come in and saw me immediately as I walked in the door holding my dog. They were extremely nice and helpful, gave me good prices beforehand, cared for her and assured me that she would be ok. This will now be my home vet office even after she recovers.]
