[117456085792274181227,100904066346012712658,Master Choe is an amazing instructor! He is an 8th degree black belt and always has something new to teach us. I've attended three martial arts schools prior to this, and the instruction here has been the best of all of them. Master Choe is also very good with children, and he will foster a sense of discipline in them that many parents have appreciated. I highly recommend!]
