[107307056976977575419,100316803568150531848,We had a wonderful stay here at the hotel, especially with the staff. The entire staff was attentive, pleasant and wonderful. From the front desk through the breakfast staff. We want to especially mention Tanya at the front desk. From the time we arrived until our departure she has been great. When we were about take our trip to Luray Caverns she offered us the "paper bag" breakfast...muffins, water etc. It was just what we needed. My husband received the best service with the business center. The rooms were clean and smelled fresh :). My only complaint was the sound coming from the refrigerator. It would buzz every half hour like an alarm clock, but that was temporary. We would recommend this site highly.]
