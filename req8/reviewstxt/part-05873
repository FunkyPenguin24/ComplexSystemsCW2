[111557815534940333268,100470541982435039267,Chuck (owner) really took care of me and my vehicle! One stop fixed all my car's problems. I highly recommend Columbia auto repair. The thing I liked most about Columbia Auto Repair is that they took the time to explain everything that was wrong with my vehicle to me in a way Iâ€™d be able to understand. I highly recommend this shop to anybody looking for great customer service, honest prices, and fast but quality work. Mike F.]
