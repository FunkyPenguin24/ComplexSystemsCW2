[110112115804120632451,100618524089977151803,I just bought my 2013 Honda Civic at RWH. By far the best experience I have ever had buying a car. I dealt with Jimbo Aycock. He was beyond great, honest, and I felt very respected as the car buyer. I had an excellent experience and would highly recommend Rusty Wallace Honda to any of my friends and family.]
