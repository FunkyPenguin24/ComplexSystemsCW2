[101298909480606550224,100014559429045834118,Horrible service. Food was good and the place was nice. It was moderately busy, but no excuse to only see the waitress about every 20 minutes. There seemed to be no sense in urgency in our waitress. Not one refill on our chips and salsa , and had to refill our own drinks.]
