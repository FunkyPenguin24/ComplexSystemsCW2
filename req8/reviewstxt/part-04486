[112691641410609932587,100397219018735139281,One of the better post offices I've used. I had a box here for business for a couple decades. Used to be a stand-alone Post Office that sorted mail etc. but now operates more like a branch PO affiliated with CLE and the Cleveland Post Office. Hours are coordinated with the CLE Airmail station. Good service and friendly people on both sides of the counter. A little busy during lunch times and at the end of the business day but most of the customers know how a post office works so the line moves. Easy access to outside boxes and sufficient angle and street parking close to the front door on streets with tolerable traffic are pluses.]
