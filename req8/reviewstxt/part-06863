[111069198997468895597,100525297525725156689,This is the 2nd summer I've used Joel's Lawn Care and without a doubt I could not be more pleased. Not only is he reasonable in his pricing structure, but the quality of his work and the detail of his trimming the yard are first class!! Actually, I've recently had neighbors in the area comment that our yard "looks like a well-maintained park". Others have indicated that it is the "show home" of the neighborhood. I couldn't thank Joel more and would highly recommend him to others that need their yard maintained. You clearly won't be disappointed! In fact, you'll be impressed and greatly satisfied by the improvement he will bring to your yard!!]
