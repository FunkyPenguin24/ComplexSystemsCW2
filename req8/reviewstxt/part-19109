[103998039941189263380,100011479438664911373,Midwest weight control is the reason this I lost 65 lbs. The staff was very genuine and they really held me accountable. Sometimes all you really need is a push in the right direction to change your life, and that is exactly what they provided me with. I started my program with them in September 2011 at 255 lbs and here I am in June at 185. I am 20 years old and attending college. Money was a huge factor for me. They did a great job of understanding that and helping me do the best that I could with a limited budget. They also gave me the knowledge to continue on my own now that my program has ended. Before starting with Midwest weight control I would try to do some research and do it myself. I failed every time I tried and was sick of struggeling. They helped me to stay on track and they really gave me the confidence to keep going. Now at 185 I went from a size 40 waist size to a 35 and I have more energy. I know that this has affected many areas of my life including school. As a freshman in college I had a 2.5 GPA and didnt work very hard. Now as after my sophomore year I have a 3.8 GPA. Changing your diet and work ethic can affect many different areas of your life, but it takes work. Anyone can change their life but it helps to have some help along the way. My sincerest thanks to the people at Midwest Weight Control for helping me change my life around. You guys rock.]
