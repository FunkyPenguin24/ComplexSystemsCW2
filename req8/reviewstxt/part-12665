[100603623526516136567,100838069403057998892,Carbon Bar is an all around classy joint! Walking into the space I immediately asked the hostess "What used to be in this building?" To my surprise learnt that it used to house the original Electric Circus Nightclub, CityTV and a dance recital hall for Disney's cruise ships! The new hip restaurant pays tribute to each past tenant in creative ways ;) Heavy on the meat dishes, Carbon Bar has a packed menu with everything from a beef cheek burger to mushroom and grits! The beer selection is fun with local and imported offerings galore. My fav however was the peanut slaw side that my buddies and I shared. It had the perfect crunch and zing to compliment our dinners. The icing on the cake was the rib samples that arrived at our table...compliments of the chef of course. Even though I don't eat meat, twas a nice gesture!]
