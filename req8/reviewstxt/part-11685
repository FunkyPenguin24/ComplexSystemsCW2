[114021593361125373490,100784696127095925808,We we introduced to Martin through a friend who had used him to 'fix' the issues caused by another designers poor work on their renovation. Based on this recommendation, we used Martin's services to design an extension to a 1940's fibro house. We wanted the design to look like it 'had always been there' and to maintain the original feel and features of the house. We are very happy that Martin's design managed to do both of these things while creating a modern, usable space for our family. The end result is exactly what I imagined from Martin's drawings. Martin was always available for consultations outside of 'office hours' and always professional. I am happy to recommend his service to our friends.]
