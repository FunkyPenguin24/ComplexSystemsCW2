[104062111011419152181,101131277695399713561,My daughter & I went on Black Friday looking for a good deal on a new Fusion. The dealership is currently under construction, but somehow they are managing to keep the lot flowing & functioning for customers. We parked & hadn't even had a chance to walk up to the temporary trailer they're using, when we were greeted by a friendly, soft spoken gentleman. We explained to Tim that both my daughter & I were looking for a new lease. Tim was swift, informative, knowledgeable, adaptive, and sometimes almost psychic. We both left that evening with brand new vehicles tailored to our individual needs. Also, while Beechmont Ford was extremely busy, Tim deftly managed our time to keep us from feeling bored or ignored. It was a truly pleasant & enjoyable experience. If you're looking for a car dealership that doesn't look as you as a quota, but as a human being, Beechmont Ford is the place to go.]
