[101157373321180571256,100701741644212305438,The Cuckoo clocks are amazing, this "shop" is jammed packed with every type of clock you like, as well as souvenirs etc. It is a quick drive to the outskirts of Toowoomba, not far. When you walk in you don't know where to look first. I bought my first Cuckoo clock there 20 years ago & love it to this day! Well worth the small drive just to listen to all of the clocks!]
