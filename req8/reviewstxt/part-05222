[116184529993052821003,100436581943712286493,Born and raised in Rochester, NY and having studied at both the Eastman Community Music School and the Eastman School of Music (B.M. Jazz Guitar Performance and Contemporary), I can say with confidence that the Eastman School of Music is a world-class institution. Its students, educators, and legacy speak for themselves. One can find Eastman graduates touring the world, performing in leading symphony orchestras, composing music for film and television, and filling countless other niches in the world's music community. If you're serious about understanding music on the deepest levels, don't neglect a visit to this historical school (established by George Eastman) and its extraordinary treasure trove that is the Sibley Music Library (one of the largest anywhere).]
