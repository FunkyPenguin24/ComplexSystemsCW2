[108416196348648073484,100395343808141478794,I never used to believe in acupuncture. I prefer my doctors and medicine. It took me 2 years after being in pain from my car accident to try acupuncture. Three bus stop moms highly recommended Bella so I gave her a try. I am so thankful I did. She is a kind a gentle person. She's open and genuinely concerned about me. I don't know how it works but I know I definitely feel different. Better. Looser. I'm a believer now. And I believe in Bella.]
