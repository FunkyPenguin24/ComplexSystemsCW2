They constantly take their phone off of the hook so they can play 'catch up' with current orders and then when caught up, place it back on the hook. I've suspected this for a long time, as have many other potential customers I've spoken with, but tonight I caught them doing it red-handed, purposely going down there so as to catch them off guard...lol... Forget that lousy service; too many other options in this city! I called Goodfella's, only to be told my pizza would be ready in 30 minutes, and I am, right now, eating a delicious, cheese & sausage drenched 12-cut square from Goodfella's for a buck or two LESS! I've ordered from Goodfella's several time in the past, but now I will be a permanent customer. Their pizza is very, very good, and their service in right on. See ya, Riverside!]
