[113438502497738982417,100903041061904376941,Had Lasix 7 years ago with such a positive experience! The staff is so welcoming. The doctors are so caring and tell you whats going on every step of the way. Came back recently for an eye exam and still have 20/15 vision...7 years later and with an astigmatism in both eyes! Would recommend Dr. Dello Russo to anyone who wants to get rid of the burden of eyeglasses or contacts.]
