[107582485382074193944,100460056585432930261,They are a hometown bank who had a miscue that was blown tremendously out of proportion! The service has always been excellent this speaking from my 20+ years as an actual real person and account holder there! It is so funny to hear all of these stories especially considering I have lived in this town my whole life and none of the names who have posted reviews actually live here! When you were reading the news stories, before you post a negative comment and review of a place maybe check the makeup of the community! We all know one another don't put your nose where it doesn't belong. Long tenure of employees that care for the people of our community, they didn't shut the doors when the business was going to other locations they modified the way they did business and worked to provide even better service! Keep up the good work!]
