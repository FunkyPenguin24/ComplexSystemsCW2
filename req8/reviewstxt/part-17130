[114928545236150444602,101083128023181071770,I lived near this restaurant for over two years and I always had an amazing time and delicious food. I would walk here nearly everyday from school and buy a soda and a Sub or chat with Hannah and/or Gus. There is an extremely friendly environment here. I have recommended it to multiple people and as far away as I live now, I am still trying to find my way there for an Italian Sausage sub, Cheesecake, A soda, and a chat. I would tell anyone and everyone I know as long as there was two subs and enough cheesecake for me. Shoutout to Gus, Hannah, Tony, and Frank!!!!! I love you guys!!!!!]
