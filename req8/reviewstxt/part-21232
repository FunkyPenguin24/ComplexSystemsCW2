[109025405001719563745,100124702235951247959,Having grown up in Arizona and California, I know what authentic Mexican food tastes like. This is authentic Mexican food. I've lived in Hawaii for nearly a year, have visited most of the islands, and this is possibly the best Mexican food that I've had in the state. Lucy's even gives a lot of the authentic places back in Arizona and California a run for their money. I had the carnitas plate and my girlfriend had the bean burrito plate. We were both very satisfied, and we ended up having enough food for 2 more meals each (a total of 6 meals for purchasing 2; the portion sizes are huge). The carnitas were perfectly crispy, not the soggy, greasy mess that you get at a lot of "authentic" places. The tortillas were delicious and tasted/felt freshly made. The guacamole was awesome and clearly homemade (we saw them making some while we were ordering). The food is AMAZING. The price is AMAZING. The portions are ENORMOUS. The servers are AWESOME. If you're in Hilo, you should try eating here.]
