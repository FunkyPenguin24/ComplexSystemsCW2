[108390374020469159423,100579550917546068643,My wife and I took lessons with Kia ahead of our wedding to surprise our friends and family with a choreographed first dance. The experience from the first interaction straight through Kia caring enough to send us words of encouragement the day of has been outstanding. We've decided to make this an ongoing indefinite experience and will be taking classes ongoing to learn additional styles and continue with a great activity that brings us closer. I'd recommend Kia and Arthur Murray in Cambridge to anyone looking into dance lessons!]
