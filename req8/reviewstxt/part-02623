[115605154806621531899,100294341010216565220,Bryan from Home Heating came to do a clean and service and check on problems with fan turning on at proper time. He was very professional and gladly answered all our questions. He went through the through all the connections to see if there were any problems and made a few wiring changes to see if that would solve the problem. 2 of the 3 fusible links were bad and were replaced. He determined the problems may have been caused by the thermostat and recommended replacing it if I felt comfortable to do it on my own or he would be glad to do it but did let me know that it obviously would be a fair bit more expensive to have it done professionally. I appreciated that he would not try to push that it needed to be done by him for a price, if he thought it could be handled by the homeowner in most cases.]
