[106043984975620589154,100684128420018236618,I have been going to Jodi at Todd Shalley's since moving to Bluffton a couple of years ago. This is a great establishment. Jodi has done an excellent job with my hair and color. The atmosphere is lovely and comfortable. All the stylists seem very professional. Jodi listens to what I would like to have done. The prices are within my expectations. Definitely a touch of class in this great community~]
