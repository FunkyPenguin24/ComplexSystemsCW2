[108721102034496976067,101031114991139318015,When you need an awesome "healer", who happens to be an awesome chiropractor, this is the doctor to see. I don't work for just anyone, and I thoroughly admire this guy. He is a huge value to the community, as he is not your usual chiropractor that only fixes you just enough to keep you coming back. Instead, this Doctor, Dr Buhrman, has "solutions" that actually eliminate your need for much future chiropractic, but for perhaps an occasional adjustment, much like going to the Dentist once every 6 months for a cleaning, and annually for a dental exam and xrays. After all, what's more important, the bones that are your teeth (that you can do without, that you can live without)? Or, the bones of your spine, that you can't live without, and should at least be taken care of regularly, ideally on a preventative basis from the start, much like we have gotten into the habit of doing with our teeth. Just do the same for your neck and back, if not here, somewhere. You just won't necessarily find the care elsewhere that you will find here, with Dr Buhrman. Troy]
