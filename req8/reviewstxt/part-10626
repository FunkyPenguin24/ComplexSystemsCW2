[104990376233732881233,100727910714067681923,On this past August 3rd, 2013, I stayed at the Hampton Inn Nashville-Airport, and had the very unfortunate experience of being lodged next door to a group of guests that held a party in their room into the early morning hours. It took 3 calls to the front desk before the manager on duty escorted the guests and their friends from the building around midnight. I unfortunately had lost precious hours of sleep, considering I was waking up very early the next day to drive 800 miles to my next destination. The following morning at check-out the attendant apologized for the experience and said the manager, Larry Manghane, would be sending me a certificate for an complimentary night stay to compensat, per Hampton Inn's 100% Guarantee policy. Two weeks passed, and I was not contacted by Hampton Inn, nor received any information or reimbursement. Any emails to Mr. Manghane have gone unanswered. As far as I can tell, Hampton Inn's 100% satisfaction guarantee policy is a farce, at least at this location. I recommend staying somewhere else to save your money and get some sleep.]
