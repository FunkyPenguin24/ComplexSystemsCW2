[102414666699372094169,100100101508056608978,My wife and I had the pleasure of staying here. It was fantastic! My wife is lactose intolerant and Bonnie (the owner) did her best to prepare a breakfast according to her eating habits. The room had some flaws, however, it was nothing to compared to the food and service received. All couples had to sit next to each other, and introduce in the morning during breakfast. It was so much fun. We plan to return, and our favorite part was there there were no children allowed in the rooms. It was a beautifully quiet stay!]
