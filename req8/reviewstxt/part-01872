[101430303848554276803,100256077257252220821,I first went here because I did not have insurance and these guys had the best prices. Shortly after I got insurance again, but have been coming here for years - prices aside, they simply do a good job. Doesn't hurt much during and not at all after, the doctor (I've been seeing Dr. Igor) cares about you, and takes the time to explain what's happening. He actually drew me a diagram of what a root canal procedure actually involves when I asked him about it - not many docs will do that! Would recommend.]
