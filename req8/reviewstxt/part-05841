[109208527012357320317,100468676308581122102,I stopped in here yesterday to get my first piercing (excluding my ears) and was pleasantly surprised. I was a bit nervous but both the lady at the front as well as the piercer himself were very friendly and helped me to relax. It was very cheap, which worried me at first, but it certainly doesn't seem to show in the work. It was done very quickly and without pain. Everything he used came out of its own fresh unopened wrap, and he took his time ensuring proper placement. I'm very happy about the service, quality, and price of this place, and would definitely go back if I ever desire another piercing.]
