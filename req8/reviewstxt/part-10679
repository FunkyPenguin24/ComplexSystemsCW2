[101022188710119793279,100730666837255176478,Been there for a first time and was surprised with a good atmosphere in there. Liked live music, great songs by singers but too loud for such a small premise. Service was quite good and polite. Many compliments to beautiful waitress Olga. Didn't like covers charge for not having food actually.]
