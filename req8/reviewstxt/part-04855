[100074309040176661086,100416294728083222706,Very nice people who are interested in building long term relationships with their customers. Several times I have had a problem with a recumbent trike I bought from them, and the always been very helpful and seemed much more interested in getting me back on the road than making a buck. They also worked with the manufacturer when I had a warranted failure of the frame. I didn't have to do anything, they took care of it all. Great folks and very UNPRETENTIOUS!]
