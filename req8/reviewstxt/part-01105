[104787549001626079606,100216120760077965892,I have a newborn who is 7 weeks old, and when I was pregnant I started to itch A LOT, everynight I had to have my husband just scratch my back for at least 10 minutes, I also had a little rash on my stomach which I had for awhile, before I got pregnant. I started helping Donna with your marketing 2 years ago, so when this started to happen to me I asked her what it could be, it was driving me and my husband crazy. Donna said most likely it was food allergies, I told her I am not allergic to anything. Donna said you may not think you are, she had me do a blood test to see what foods i was sensitive to. Sure enough it came back that I was in high red for cow's milk something I drank EVERYDAY! I stopped drinking cow's milk and changed my diet and had an amazing pregnancy and now we are watching for signs in the baby. I am SO thankful Donna at East West Wellness was there to help me out, my doctor just told me it was dry skin! Thank you Donna!]
