[113242050540725338564,100598080012964826477,Totally agree with the last post, great up until you sign the papers. Then your at the back of the line. Had Ford Credit calling for weeks cause Sherwood Ford failed to pay out the lease on my trade in. Papers had been signed for 2 months. They even lied to Ford Credit and said it was my fault cause they couldn't get ahold of me. If Ford Credit can get ahold of me then a local dealership should have no trouble. Also was promised that the vehicle would be ready several times and everytime was let down. And lastly they even called me on a saturday, the day after I got the new truck to complain about my trade in!! Are you serious!?! I hope Ford takes away their SVT status.]
