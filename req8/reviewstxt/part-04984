[106904768615991260059,100422276722503962947,THE BEST, HANDS DOWN!!! After visiting nearly 15 CPAP/Durable Equipment Providers in the Birmingham Area, I luckily ended up at Neighborhood CPAP. I don't ever give reviews online, but after my experience with the great people at Neighborhood CPAP, I felt I had to give them the great review they deserve. They are by far the MOST knowledgeable and friendly staff of anywhere I visited and they have all of the latest equipment. If there is a bad review on here, DON'T BELIEVE IT!! They are so far superior to any other provider I visited or even talked to, I will never go anywhere else. Do not buy a CPAP machine without talking to them first. I promise, you will not regret it. ~From the pickiest shopper EVER!!!]
