[100762512525286644906,100563482612427447804,Our recent stay at the Kilmarnock Inn was very nice! We especially liked the court yard which sits in the middle of all the house-like buildings where the guest rooms are. It is a big garden patio with a little pond and tables and chairs. The guest houses and rooms are about 4 years old, except for the main building which is 127 years old! So the rooms are all really nice and new. The staff there are super nice and the dinner and breakfast were top notch. I only wish check-out was not at 10 because we would like to have had a little more time for the nice breakfast! I definitely recommend this Inn. The owner told us where to find a small public beach close by and it was beautiful and the water was warm for swimming.]
