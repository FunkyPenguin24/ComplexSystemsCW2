[116196179911521819194,100704737779288434160,I was in here last month for a bite to eat and a hot choc. I asked how big their $8 burger was, and they said in a snarky tone "Big enough", to which I was slightly upset. Nevertheless, I ordered the burger and a hot chocolate, and needless to say, the burger was small, cut in half, and I was only given half. The lettuce they used was very strange, I hated it. I felt like I was forced to eat it, as I felt that due to the service I received earlier, I would be refused a refund. The hot chocolate wasn't much better, it was weak, luke warm and tasted a little like sour milk. However, the decor is very nice, it has books to read, a live band on weekends and such, but it's not enough to save my review. Overall, I hated this cafe, and will not be coming back in a hurry.]
