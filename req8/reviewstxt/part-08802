[113830836298968886906,100627722248450003056,Great for massage and chiropractic adjustments. The Year of Wellness is a wonderful deal, and allows you to get reasonably-priced massages and adjustments. Dr. Moyer (chiro) is great to work with. He asks for areas of focus and gives a quick, efficient adjustment. He also recommends exercises/stretches that make sense for the given injury. The massage therapists are great; I have had individual and couples appointments with several of them. They know what they are doing and check in to ensure the pressure/style is appropriate. Great organization, great prices, good location.]
