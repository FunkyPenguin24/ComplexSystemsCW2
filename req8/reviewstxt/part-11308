[115922199394183003337,100764193163292427224,No idea what the clown below is talking about, NO ONE is in this gym wearing anything religious or Pro Muslim, that's just crap!!, this a REAL gym with REAL equipment and I've only ever seen people dedicated and training hard, many women train there and are respected. Terry & Co. run a top notch gym and I've always enjoyed training there and will do for many years to come as I have in the past 4yrs. If you want girly backpacks and skinny Lycra clad plastic people everywhere, this place is not for you, normal to serious people train here even many in their 70's! Everyone has a great time and the staff are the best I have experienced at any gym.]
