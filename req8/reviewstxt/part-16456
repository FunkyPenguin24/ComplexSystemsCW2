[102024317412262890135,101044322513581481801,I was shown an amazing Washer and Dryer set. Paid for it, and the delivery. Was delivered 3 times, yes 3 times different washer/dryer set than in the store over a two week period. It totally sucked. Ended up going to Sears and getting the same thing same price, but with a 3 year warranty included.]
