[102043751451041740259,100003324420219438442,I've been a Keyes Lexus customer for at least 10 years and always received a loaner car, no matter what the service was. This time, I needed both the 5,000 mile service and auto armor. The service rep. booked me for the 5,000 mile service, would not offer a loaner, and then said I needed to call a different department to arrange for the auto armor. My husband was furious with this response, called the service rep. and castigated him. After that, the rep. called back and arranged for both services at the same time, and a loaner car. Things are just not as convenient at this Lexus dealer Service as they used to be, but I'm glad they are willing to fix and improve. Keep up the good work!]
