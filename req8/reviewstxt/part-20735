[105132982068062287627,100098659239416923504,I was not impressed at all. We went on Thanksgiving and to start the prices were substantially higher than what was listed on the Thanksgiving menu posted on their website. The food was mediocre at best and ridiculously overpriced. Atmosphere and service were OK. I know many much better restaurants that charge a fraction of The Fort prices.]
