[100065256521295867627,100106419190701133917,Quick and friendly service. The pad thai was delicious. The appetizers are pretty expensive. Picked up a appetizer combo and it doesn't come with rice? $8.50 for a few appetizers is ridiculous. I called and the guy on the phone stated it comes with rice. The place is always a ghost town. Guess business is bad. I'll stick to 4 seasons down the street]
