[107330048850707690482,100549208178135248873,I really and truly enjoyed my trip tp Paradeep and Bhitarkanika National Reserve Forest. It was a delightful experience to be sailing in the Brahmani river in a bhotbhoti! I agree that i have been to Sundarbans a number of years ago by a launch and i actually night-stayed in the launch but sailing is always a delightful experience, be it for one hour or e few days... We had been a little wrong in selecting the time for our trip but we could not go there before the Holi as my ICSE examinations were going on before that. By the time we were at Paradeep it was quite hot and we unfortunately could not see much of the famous white crocodile of Bhitarkanika. we did see few saltwater crocodiles as well as spotted deer (cheetal) and a few harmless wild animals. The thing we saw the most were the stilt roots and breathing roots of the mangrove trees. There is a very interesting crocodile museum where there are skeletons and skulls of crocodiles as huge as 18 feet in length. Moreover, there were preserved eggs of crocodiles, of Olive Ridley turtles (which are rarely seen as they are endangered species) and many other marine animal species (snakes like cobra included). The journey as well as the scenic beauty quite enchanted me. As a nature lover, I would surely request every other nature lover to pay a visit to this reserved forest. I cannot of course guarantee full satisfaction but I assure you that this place is ideal for a short break from our monotonous day to day routine. And do not please forget Paradeep - it has a beautiful beach, a grand port and lighthouse, an amazing aquarium (the place i liked the most) and the mohona (meeting) of Mahanadi with the Bay of Bengal which mesmerized me...]
