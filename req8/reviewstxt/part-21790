[110855734734373617065,100155589023100648621,I was taken there by a Mexican friend of mine about 3 years ago and I loved it. As a mater of fact I have not found a better place in Charlotte. I have taken a lot of my friends and they all said it was the best they have had also. The portions are big. The food is great and the price is lower than ALL the chain Mexican type restaurants. I could not rate El Taco Veloz any higher than 5 stars otherwise I would!]
