[118381094703911609573,100515964063363867321,Really annoying experience there which means I will never go back. Took a friend for pizza during their happy hour. The pizza is pretty good but is also fairly overpriced. We didn't have long left before the happy hour closed but we were in time. I asked the lady behind the bar to be sure but after she had taken my money and gone to the till her boss told her she had to charge full price even though we were in time. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded paying more but you can't change the rules of a happy hour to suit your own greed. If you want people to order half an hour earlier - close the happy hour half an hour earlier. For me, food and decor matter little but good service is key and I will never go back. The Camel around the corner does great pies, with a good selection of board games and a really nice atmosphere - as well as really nice staff. I will always go there instead.]
