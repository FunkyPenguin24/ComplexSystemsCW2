[106319269388524815166,101169711472254389150,I will be moving into Encantada Apartments in January. During the viewing and application process, the staff have went above my expectations. I have viewed many apartment complexes and none have had such attentive and nice staff as Encantada. They have communicated quickly via email and phone for new information and availability at this complex during my apartment search. Upon my visits everything has been spotless and quiet. The property is beautiful and in a great location. My 11 year old daughter attends one of the best schools nearby and we cannot wait to move and see what else this community has in store for us.]
