[115179664804104832229,100898388832699925005,Zoom!!! My soon-to-be husband and I just had Zoom Teeth Whitening done. It was not at all painful and they took their time making sure that the procedure went as expected. Lesley is especially thoughtful and kind. Whenever I book an appointment I ask for her to be the assistant on the job. Dr. Yee is so thorough and really keeps his focus on not costing you too much money if at all possible. He always gives you all the options and let's you choose how to proceed. Teddy is a really great dental hygienist. He explains things so well - like no other hygienist has in all the years I've been going to see the dentist. I highly recommend them! ps the front desk is kind, considerate and very very welcoming!]
