[111773382350103972330,100401574509579510139,I just wanted to write to you about the great experience my husband and I had with Closet Factory. From browsing the showroom to installation, everyone was very knowledgeable and helpful. We recently bought a house in CO and needed to optimize space for a study/guest room. We thought that a murphy bed and a built-in desk would do the job...and boy, does it! We upgraded materials and really like the look. The two items use the space very well. Even with the bed down, there is plenty of room to use the desk if necessary, and there's also plenty of room around the bed. The installers were very nice, competent and helpful as well. They took care to keep the path to the room clean and cleaned up everything after they were finished. We are very pleased with the final product and will very likely call on Closet Factory in the future. -MOD]
