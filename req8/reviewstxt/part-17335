[118169757579293815551,101093719360914741039,Wonderfully responsive and patient staff. I originally came for physical therapy on my knee, and my therapist stuck with it even when the original diagnosis didn't completely resolve the problem. I was content with some improvement, but Sophia wasn't until I was back to 100%, and we tried things until we found and resolved the root cause. I've since been able to return to full activity with no pain. I've come back to Joint Ventures for chiropractic work, which is helping me tremendously in my daily work environment. The staff is extremely responsive and listens to everything that's going on. I've been able to raise seemingly-unrelated issues and get them resolved.]
