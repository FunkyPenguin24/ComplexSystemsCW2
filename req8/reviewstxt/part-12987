[113399322893961755320,100856124111296816828,I arrived at the dealership service department and was greeted immediately by Casey. He worked quickly to get my car checked in for service. My car is due for the big 30,000 but I was there just for a oil/filter change. Casey asked me if I would like a information sheet explaining what the service department does during the Civic K service. He was helpful and to the point with the questions I had. I leased this 12 Civic from Bend Honda and had a great experience.....and continue to have excellent service to this day. Spoke to Larry on the lot while I was waiting for my ride and actually enjoyed the conversation and did not feel like I was be sold a pitch.....nice fella.]
