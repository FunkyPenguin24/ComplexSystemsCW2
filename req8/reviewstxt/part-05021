[105401713156230350453,100424020881077372109,My date and I ate at the Irish Pub attached to this restaurant. Neither of us drink so we were there solely for the food. The food was amazing and the service was great. Especially considering that one bartender was taking care of the whole place. I definitely recommend this place before ALL of the other restaurants in the area.]
