[116852974070766470113,100243912330065965985,Went to WeFixIt about six months ago- oh my god! I do have some experience fixing cars, too! And as a woman, for probably only the second time in over 25 years I was treated like a partner in repairing my car! Dean actually listened to my explanations and descriptions and ACCURATELY conveyed them to Andreas! They explained when I asked for explanations, and treated me like if I knew enough to ask a question, I must know what I was referring to! NO patronizing, NO superior eye-rolling, NO acting like I was not there. These men were thoughtful, and offered that if I had any desire to work on my own car (sometimes I do- but no equipment or garage) I COULD! Because there is also the option for UFixIt at their garage...words cannot express my appreciation for the partnership with this garage. I tell everyone I know to go there, they know what they are doing and they do it well!]
