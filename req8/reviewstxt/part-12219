[102224527046792518674,100812874909860199502,We've been going to Whitie's for almost fifteen years. I trust them completely, and they're the only mechanics we go to. I trust them so much that I'd rather buy a used car and have them work on it than a new car and be forced to use a dealer's mechanic for the warranty. They always call with accurate estimates, and they tell you how much life you can expect out of things like brakes or tires. The mechanics have done great work, the front desk staff are all friendly and professional, and the owner can speak "Car Guys" so you can narrow down the problem on the phone alone.]
