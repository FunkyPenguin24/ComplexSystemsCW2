[100435731951116410502,100002893113354924721,Was hesitant at first as Essential Beauty salons have had a bad rep at some of their locations. However, I gave it a chance and was pleasantly surprised. This store just opened 3 weeks ago.Great if you live locally and just want a cheap and convenient place to go for your usual beauty maintenance i.e. waxing. Therapist are mature and professional. I plan on coming back again :)]
