[103130986295472987201,100800418506626965012,One of my best meal in england yet :D Came today 21/07/2013, had a roast beef stripe and this meal was simply amazing. Meat was full of flavors, very nice sauce, not drowning the meat. Cauliflowers with a nice cheese sauce <3 carrots/parsnip nicely roasted. The only "bad" part was the potatoes, wasn't a big fan of it but still ate it. Had a bread and custard dessert and this was to die for. Definitly going back and looking forward to wedding meal there in september :D Place does look great and neat, big size parking. Staff is friendly and available with a nice frenchman :D Thank you.]
