[108293584036738498587,100717097523775114602,At first blush this looks like an inviting Mexican-themed bar. However... the Patron margaritas we ordered were in plastic cups (ok, it was Cinco De Mayo) and the food was cold. Service was lacking although the waitress was busty. When our bill came we were charged $12 each for the margaritas. Did I mention they were served in plastic cups. As a reference point, I normally expect to pay $8 to $10 in downtown Chicago or one of the premium places in Grand Rapids (Marriott, Ruth's Chris, Chop House, etc.) for a top-shelf drink made with all premium ingredients, served in beautiful glassware. This place is a rip off. If you happen to stop in, stick with bottled beer and skip the food. Beyond that fare it's a joke.]
