[114025100611572646935,100657373262401590114,Dr. Tellman's staff is really friendly! They get you in and out the door promptly. Dr. Tellman is a great dentist. He doesn't push you for things that are not necessary. They are very mindful of making sure you are comfortable at all times. The office itself is open with TVs to help keep you entertained while they work on you or while you are waiting. Did I mention there's fresh cookies when you check out!?! They're great!]
