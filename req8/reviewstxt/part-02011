[110866230876695504906,100263255477087805676,I have nothing bad to say about Southern Dutchess Eye Care. The staff is kind, friendly, and always smiling. This includes everyone, doctors, opticians, and administrative. They are very courteous and have never been rude. They treat every patient like they were a VIP. I love their ultra-modern, state-of-the-art equipment. It helps them get the job done right the first time. They have yet to mess up a pair of glasses, where other eye care facilities could never get my lenses the first time. They have a huge selection of frames, and not junk. They go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and welcome. I never feel ill at-ease there. Not many people would drive 40 miles to go to a doctor, well my family and I do. It's worth the trip!]
