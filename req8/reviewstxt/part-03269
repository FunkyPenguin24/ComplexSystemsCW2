[115327271861967458437,100327804505755619730,I purchased the 2014 Buick Verano, the staff was exceptional from beginning to end. All my questions were answered and the service was wonderful. Both Ed and George made the purchase of my dream vehicle a breeze. Ed covered the financial end with true expertise and the same for George in assisting with familiarizing me with my new vehicle and its functions. I would and have highly recommended this dealership to family and friends. I've never experience such service while purchasing a vehicle. I did not have to spend the entire day at the dealership, this was a true PLUS! Keep up the good work Jay Buick.]
