[107183286074406264045,100149902373273527698,My family and I travel to Myrtle beach every year, and every year I must get them to come here to Donatos! The pizza here is probably the best I've ever eaten, with super sweet sauce, delicious meats and perfectly golden cheese. On top of the amazing quality, the food is affordable, and the staff are super friendly. They checked up on us and made sure we liked the food, and even gave us a free order of cinnamon sticks for dessert! I tell you, that's one way to get customers to return! Whatever you are doing, those of you at Donatos, KEEP DOING IT!]
