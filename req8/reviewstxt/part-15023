[106059594082575978112,100968166856440156604,When my husband and I first looked around for a photographer, we knew that we couldn't just settle for any photographer because we wanted to have amazing, detailed, gorgeous, and classic photographs to show our friends, family, and - some day - our kids. We wanted to be proud of the images captured, but most importantly, we wanted to know that - in the future - when we look back at our images, we would be reminded of our best day ever and also be happy we went with the photographer we chose. Carretto Studio exceeded all of our expectations the very first day we met with them, and I knew for a fact that I did not want to work with any other photographer. Andy and Elizabeth are friendly, personable, professional, and so much fun to work with that, at times, you forget that they're there to capture your wedding day. They make everyone - from the family to the wedding party - feel comfortable and at ease. If you're still looking for a photographer(s) who will - no doubt - give you some of the most beautiful and creative work of art, then I highly recommend choosing Andy and Elizabeth. You'll definitely be working with two of the best photographers in St. Louis!]
