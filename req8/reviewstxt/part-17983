[104296377185713787648,101128239395496366683,Disappointing lunch at the Ale House this past week. Of the most important components of business, People, are your number one asset. Your employees and most important are your customers. A few of my notes from our lunch time visit. We arrived and were quickly seated at 11:45. Of the 8 in my party, 1 wanted to order the wings, we'll he couldn't because the "rub" had just been placed on them and it would be 30 min before ready to cook. (not good, should've had rub on by 10:30, since they open at 11 for lunch). Next another person wanted their burger medium rare, they were told they could not cook it to medium rare. I order a Burger and it came out "medium rare" and the other person had a medium well...what is going on?? Before we order, we had been there about 5 minutes and I asked the waitress if the music could be turned down some, I could not hear the person that was directly across the table from me. They said they did, but it was still loud. I asked a manager and she said she did not have control of the stereo system and it could not be adjusted since it was programmed in. Unfortunately, she is right, but lunch time is used for business meetings...catching up with friends or saying good by to friends...not holding a beer feast... The music can be re-programmed and controlled better if they desire. I couldn't tell you the managers name since she wasn't wearing a name tag and she never introduced herself. I don't see going back there. And in the short time they have been open, they have just as many negative comments as they do positive. And I'm not sure if these post are even monitored or replied to by the management or owner. If you want to express your positive or negative experience with this location, I suggest you send it to the owner. Lou Moshakos at 6510 chapel hill rd Raleigh, NC 27606. He owns several of Ale house restaurants and I'm sure he wants to hear your comments.]
