[112177529918626418239,100925704963710714684,My wife and I sit at the bar more often than not when we go out to nice places. Maybe we should stop that because I think we were in agreement that the past Friday night we experienced literally the worst bartender ever. She had no idea what wine they had, what was dry, what a Malbec was, ect. We ordered steaks (which she also knew nothing about) and both were miss-cooked yet she never checked back after another server brought them out. I had to flag down another server as she stayed at the other end of the bar and acted like we weren't there. This was early on a Friday, 5:30 so the place was not busy at all. When the steaks came back, she delivered them and acted as if it were our fault they were poorly cooked. To top it off, I watched her repeatedly miss-pour beer after beer and then hand them to customers with foam running down the sides. It was comical and we came to the conclusion she must have been incredibly high on life or something else. The entire experience was ruined by the worst bartender of all time and is unacceptable from a low end restaurant, let alone someone trying to be a high-end steakhouse... Bad hire!]
