[111258717349065408663,100326956168422524616,Very good and fast delivery. Went in to see whats so special abt taco bell. But i dont think i will be going there anytime soon. Service was good and fast. Burrito was good but it tasted lke a combination of south indian(rice) and north indian (roti) alng with small slices of chicken. Always i wanted to know whats so special abt nachos they were so exp,I still dont know the answer for that. If u lile soft drinks though u will like this place. Unlimited soft drinks of ur choice.]
