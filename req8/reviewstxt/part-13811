Josh is very customer service oriented. We love GameStop since it has a great exchange policy when you purchase used games. We also love their "insurance" on used systems. We got a another refurbished DS for the little bit we spent to get the extra protection. It was WELL WORTH the money. There isn't another sell and resale video store that takes care of you like this company does.]
