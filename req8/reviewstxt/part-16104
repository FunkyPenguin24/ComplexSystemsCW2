Just imagine on your wedding day making your marriage valid in their church, a photographer just happens to be taking photos of your church. The Father asks his old friend if he could kindly take photos of the couple renewing their vows. The bride and groom were so excited, it must be a blessing. The couple kindly exchange information to the photographer, and the couple is willing to pay for the digital images. Now just image the sadness as their one year anniversary comes and goes and still no images, not even one. After many attempts to contact the photographer, and then just asking for just one image of the day to remember and still offering to payâ€¦..all they are left with are broken promises and excuses and no image(s). Is this a kind of photographer you want taking your photos? I know I will not be asking him to take the most important images of my life, my friends, family or co-workers. Very sad bride and groom.]
