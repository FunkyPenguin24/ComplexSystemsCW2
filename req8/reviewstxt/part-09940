[100297423185003840899,100690090809434146475,Do not go to this restaurant!!! They triple charged my credit card and when I called (with the card people on the line) they gave me some BS story about not having a manager or cashier to help with the matter. This restaurant is like a bad nightmare that will not go away! My wife wanted crab legs so we paid a premium (more than double the normal price) for crab legs. What a ripoff!!! The legs were small, they were old. It seemed they were on the buffet for a long time. Some of the other food was ok. Some of the food was either overseasoned or underseasoned. My 9 year old could not find anything he liked (he loves chinese food). All in all, it was not a good experience and I would not go back there and definitely not recommend this place to anyone. A waste of money.]
