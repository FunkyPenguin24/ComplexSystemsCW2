[114522960682345031726,100067430078802539227,Evan Watson was EXCELLENT! He is easy to reach and returns calls promptly. He showed great care for my case, and listened to me. These may seem like simple things, but when you feel like you've been taken advantage of by the law, and nobody cares about what you have to say, it means a lot. He used his knowledge of the law and expertise to confidently request a dismissal and it was granted. He is charismatic and charming, but most of all professional. I could not have been represented by anyone better. Thank you Evan Watson!]
