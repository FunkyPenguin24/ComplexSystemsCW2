[101814792977898379147,100175492427395752194,I bought a 2012 Ford Focus and though I am not extremely pleased with the car, I love the service from Rob Sight. I got the best price I could find on the car. $2000 less than another car I test drove with same features. I have had a couple problems with the car....including the transmission, and they have been great at taking care of it for me.]
