[115944547469697862987,100200942952906739370,I have had my wedding ring in our family for 5 generations. Needless to say this piece is priceless. Over the years the ring had taken some punishment. It lost a few diamonds and the etching was severely faded. The team at Golden Key were able to replace the diamonds and hand engrave the original etchings. I have to say they repair my family ring to its original quality in two days. Perfect timing for my 10 year anniversary. Thanks Guys!]
