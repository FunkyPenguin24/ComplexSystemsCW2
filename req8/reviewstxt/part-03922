[117808129518363091778,100365054550452291981,Dr. Sabree at Dartmouth Street Vision Center and his team give excellent service (competence, friendliness) in a most convenient location (Prudential Center in Boston). I have been a customer for almost 10 years and am very happy with this service. Dr. Sabree is excellent, does all the eye exams needed to help correct eyesight impairement AND to evaluate the health status of the eyes (as prevention). He always explains very well what he is doing, how and why. The team is very nice, very helpful with insurance (they call your insurance to determine if/how much your insurance covers). Also, they are very accommodative with appointments.]
