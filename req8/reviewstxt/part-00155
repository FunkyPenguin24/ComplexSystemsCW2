[104338597578936554598,100166780683948248154,Called at about 6 pm for an 8:45 car to JFK from Prospect Park South/Flatbush. The dispatcher was friendly, and she called back just before my scheduled time to let me know what the (unmarked) cab looked like and that it was three minutes away. No complaints at all about the cab ride itself! Will definitely use again.]
