[116021821748378957324,100367164711289475564,Great experience at the store, however, I have been trying to call the store to get an issue resolved and I can't get anybody to answer. Not sure if their system is set up poorly, but I'm going on an hour now with no answer. The phone rings, it says please wait, then it hangs up. Not good.]
