[114119668025353323862,100700796946055339002,Brian has been doing my taxes now for several years. I have a day time consulting business, a portfolio or rental properties, a real estate training and education business, and an internet marketing business. So my tax situation isn't considered straightforward. Brian has done an exceptional job handling my taxes and tax prep. He's proactive in getting me my quarterly documents to file in plenty of time to get them filed, he advised me with respect to the tax implications on a complex sale of a commercial property and helped draft the appropriate language for the closing documents, and he understands the tax implications and treatments regarding real estate investing, which is huge and not very common from my experience with other tax preparers. Brian is also accessible and he's a good guy who is fun to do business with. His fees are also extremely reasonable - I get a TON of value from him. I give him my highest recommendation.]
