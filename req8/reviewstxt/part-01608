[100865658594007886948,100242059656267245091,Wanted fish tacos last night. My boyfriend really wanted to go to Rundown Caf√©. We were seated as soon as we arrived which for OBX on a Saturday night should have been a sign of what was to come. I asked for chardonnay to drink. It came room temp.; so I asked for ice. We ordered and waited....It was so loud with people talking that we could hardly have our own conversation. Then we realized that it was hot. My boyfriend was constantly patting his forehead with his napkin to wipe the beaded sweat. Our food arrived and I took my 1st bite into the bland looking fish taco and about got sick. It tasted so fishy. I asked my boyfriend to taste it and he could not eat it either. I am not a person to send food back but I felt I had to let the waitress know. Soon someone came over and offered to discount the meal that I had taken 1 bite of. We agreed and they took 40% off of the bill. What a rip off. We should have asked for the total amount to be discounted but instead just smiled and left. The next time we want fish tacos we will return to Mama Kwans....the best place on the beach for fish tacos!!!!]
