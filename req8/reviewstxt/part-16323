[103697846961088664617,101037653443884409076,I've dropped by here on multiple occasions and have never had to wait very long, despite the fact that's always very busy - maybe I'm just lucky, but it's certainly worth noting. The staff here is extremely friendly (and sometimes very attractive). I'm not too big a fan of the brunch menu, but the lunch/dinner options are wonderful and I've been delighted each time. It's also a great place to bring a book and read while having lunch - I'd recommend choosing one of the window/booth tables. The decor is also very interesting, feels very bucolic inside. You can tell a lot of attention was paid to making sure the atmosphere felt just right!]
