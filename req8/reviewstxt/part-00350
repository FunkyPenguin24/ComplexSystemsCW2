[100229093971969372349,100177386695296816639,I don't know what the Google User three years ago is talking about. I've had my tires mounted, rotated, inflated, repaired, replaced, and balanced with no problems. The old tires just disappeared no hassle about disposal. Maybe the Google user was at a different store or just got out on the wrong side of the bed. As for their online site and phone messages - come on. This is a mom and pop operation. The people who work there know tires. They know how to get them off and on your car with a minimum of fuss. They do it quickly and in a friendly manner. You get this for a rock bottom price and yes their tires are used. If you want to pay more they have a limited selection of new. I can live without the fancy website and the polished phone message. I use these guys all the time for my business. Thanks Roman!]
