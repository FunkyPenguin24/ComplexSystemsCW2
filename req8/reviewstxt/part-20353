[101041538963487034889,100078869321606901052,I recently purchased a new Toyota RAV4 from Pedersen Toyota in Fort Collins Colorado. I had taken my Corolla in for service and while waiting I couldn't but notice the new re-designed 2013 RAV4 vehicles. My current vehicle was leased and I had a few months remaining and really wasn't in the market for a new vehicle. Robert Langius one of the Sales and Leasing consultants was able to help me and offered to see if I could turn in my leased Corolla early and get into a new RAV4. Turns out that I was able to and I am the new proud owner of a beautiful RAV4. Robert was helpful and made the process really easy. I would recommend working with him and Pedersen Toyota to anyone looking for a hassle-free experience. Their dealership has been in business for over 42 years and is owned by the Pedersen Family.
