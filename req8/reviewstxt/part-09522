[108874538924896231435,100667130707573100496,I used to love Rafferty's and the people that work their are great but tonight, I was over priced and given rotten portions on everything. I mean Rafferty's was always the most expensive but you got what you pay for, tonight on a Saturday night, I had the most lousy to go order ever! Apple Walnut Crunch, I was lucky if I got a $2.00 portion, a chicken finger platter with fries, the chicken tenders the very few that there were, weren't even whole tenders, the fries with both orders were half full. I could spit nails. The hot fingers were at least full size chicken tenders, but not much hot sauce on them. I guess everyone has an off night, just which I had never gone there. I will probably call or write corporate in Bowling Green and let them know, they would hate this more than I.]
