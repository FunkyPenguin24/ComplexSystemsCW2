[101139034041522164430,100412093765740006320,My 6-year old saw people with Lego bags and justly assumed there must be a Lego Store somewhere in the city. We asked around and when we arrived we were greeted with large lego structures of animals and characters. As far as product goes, they have a great deal of collections and sets and even a "pick-a-brick" section where you can fill up a cup with as much as you can for $15. We enjoyed ourselves. It's worth finding even if you don't have kids just to gawk at the large structures.]
