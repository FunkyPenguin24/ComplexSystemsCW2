[116839561302192774904,100929839556255645256,The service here is above and beyond anything I've ever experienced at a gun store. Cullen, the owner, is very knowledgeable and helpful. If they don't have what you are looking for on the rack the guys at Republic will hunt it down at a fair price. I will be taking the CCW class soon!]
