[118205549683240549891,100771230062760951211,The stay here was less than stellar...we booked a block of rooms for some out of town guests and unfortunately the front desk staff was primarily less than professional, some of the rooms weren't satisfactorily cleaned upon check in with one having a strong smell of smoke (in a NON SMOKING facility). Some guests, along with myself, stayed for at least three nights and the rooms were never tended to. Upon check in it wasn't explained that they only clean occupied rooms every two days. The WiFi was very unreliable unless connected in the ballroom. This used to be a top rated facility...customer care and overall satisfaction should be the primary goal, not the money. Maybe some internal/external training on customer service would benefit this establishment.]
