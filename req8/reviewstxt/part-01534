[102458037336349084190,100237652656769988737,Top Notch service from ARS Universal all around. The team installed my system last year and did an awesome job. This post is occaisioned by the semi-annual service. My tech, Sina, called me to let me know he was on the way, showed up at the right time, and called me to let me know he had arrived. He was professionally dressed in a sharp uniform, and wore shoe protectors in the house. He was professional, courteous and friendly, and worked efficiently and quickly. When he spotted some minor issues he took corrective action and kept me informed in layman's terms. I give Sina, and ARS Universal my most enthusiastic recommendation!]
