[101009590212331111483,100710889028743938180,I'm having a great time in the RCI condo exchange here. I'm on the 4th floor, and have used the kitchenette for several days to make breakfast, brunch and dinner. The location can't be beat for the price in Waikiki--we are adjacent to Dukes' Lane and across Kuhio Ave. from the International Market and an ABC store. Maybe people from outside Hawaii don't realize what things cost in Honolulu? I have found the staff to be friendly and the room (an efficiency studio with murphy bed) clean and comfy and more than adequate. The fact that I can wheel myself to the beach in my wheelchair in less than 10 minutes is a plus! Yes there is city noise--turn up the fan at night folks! Point it away from you if you don't want the breeze!]
