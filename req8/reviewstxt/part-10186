[107688468223258390058,100704347467989950155,The first year I lived here wasn't too bad. You can't expect a 5 star apartment for as little as I was paying, especially for the nice neighborhood the apartments are located in. However, as soon as I resigned my lease, everything went down hill. Quickly. As hot as it was outside, my was not adequate to keep my apartment under 80 degrees. After ignoring my complaints for awhile, they finally put AC units in two windows. When I did not leave them on when I wasn't home, they came in (without prior notification or consent) and took them out. Long story short, I continued to sweat in my own apartment until I was forced to move out. Other problems: screens always fall out, are never put back in, the top management appears kind and helpful when you're there, but then do nothing for you. The maintenance guys are super friendly and responsive, but it shouldn't be their job to advocate for changes to happen. All in all, if you're just looking for a cheap place, go for it. Otherwise, it's pretty awful. **Also-Pet Owners Beware- There is a $178 pet cleaning charge upon move out that is hidden in the lease and not covered by the pet deposit**]
