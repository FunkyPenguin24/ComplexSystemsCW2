[114987255341811656487,100388789431567583081,Wow. We first met the manager, who greeted us and brought us over to Andy. He walked us through the brand and models - he was excellent. We decided to buy used, so we were introduced to Angel. He did a very thorough job giving us the various options that he had and went out of his way for us. When we came back to buy, again, he was wonderful, meeting every need we presented. He even beat my credit union's interest rate! He was very fair in dealing with us, especially regarding options that we probably didn't need - he wasn't a typical salesman trying to upsell everything. When he delivered the car, it was perfect; he went through the operation of the car and all its options in a very understandable way. No question was too much; he was very patient. Also, Helen was great in dealing with (all the paperwork, financing, etc.) Knowing most car dealers as we do, we weren't expecting such great service. Overall, we were pleasantly surprised with our excellent experience at Habberstad and couldn't be happier!]
