[101592272412763027621,100788607266206178108,Get thee to a hackerspace. This is the kind of place where you'll see programmers making art and artists doing science. You'll learn a lot by hanging out here. The community of awesome and smart people is what makes this place really great, but when it comes to tools here are some of the highlights: laser cutter 3D printers small CNC router vinyl cutter large format printer full woodshop with nice table saw full machine shop with nice lathe sheet metal brake, shears, slip roller corner notcher small propane forge and anvil welders (both MIG and TIG) plasma torch vacuum former industrial sewing machine & serger electronic knitting machine scanning electron microscope full electronics shop with scopes, meters, power supplies, irons and zillion components ... this list goes on but I should probably stop here. Since joining a few years ago I've learned to use all of the tools listed above, and also learned some math, basic computer science, and brewing/extracting. It's changed my life. Get thee to a hackerspace.]
