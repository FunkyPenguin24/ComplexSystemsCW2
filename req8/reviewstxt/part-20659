[110309096569838278813,100094185905227381087,Biker bar full of regulars. Awesome happy hour, two for one beers. Great place to avoid crowds and loud pop music. One of my favorite places to enjoy a PBR while listening to ZZ Top. Things get rough later in the night, so avoid this place if you can't hang.]
