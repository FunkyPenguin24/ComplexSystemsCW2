[115870210398958330945,100896520144528940585,After I went there (needing crowns) and the work on my teeth started I was told that the doctor working on my teeth was leaving/retiring thou will be in occasionally to work.... 30-60 days after the work was finished and over $4000 spent, there was a problem with one of the crowns retaining food ... went back, now Dr Bowles is at the helm and the other doctor gone I was told it will be another $1200 to redo that crown .... the worst thing was that Dr Bowles charged me $70 to examine what his gone partner did, and to give me the $1200 estimate to redo his partners work ... the way it was handled is one of the poorest customer service/satisfaction I ever encountered.
