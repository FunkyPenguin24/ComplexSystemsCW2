[111320905463091597532,100409369526372905151,HORRIBLE place to live. I wish we could afford to move. New management comes in every year and makes their own rules. By the time you learn all of them new management has come in. Rent goes up every year yet nothing to show for it. They are constantly finding every little thing wrong with the ones of us who own our homes. Feels like they are trying to push homeowners out so they can move their rental homes in and charge an outrageous price.]
