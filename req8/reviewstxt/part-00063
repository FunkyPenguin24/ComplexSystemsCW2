[103869698524438387360,100162033169324199901,First time I've ever had crawfish ettoufee that had rosemary in it and it was horrible. When I sent it back the lady there told me that they would not replace my meal without an extra charge. BTW I am from creole land and have eaten and fixed this style food all of my life. Never heard of it being fixed like this and this place is sayid to be owned by a creole. They don't have file powder and they dont serve Community Coffee, REALLY!!!!]
