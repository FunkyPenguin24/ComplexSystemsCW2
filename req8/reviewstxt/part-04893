[100406042416309444381,100417938078567192608,I don't like to complain, and I know that food service workers are underpaid. But they messed my order up two nights in a row. I ordered a "pumpkin spice chai latte." But when I walked out of the store, I took a sip and it was coffee. I hate coffee. I went back in and told the barista that she gave me coffee. She told me that is what is in a latte. I reminded her that I asked for a chai latte, not coffee. She told me she was confused by my order and said I should have asked for a "chai tea latte with pumpkin spice." Okay fine. I guess I need to insert the word "tea" in my order and swap out the adjective for a preposition. Annoying but not a big deal Day 2: I order a "chai tea latte with pumpkin spice" from the same barista. I walk outside, take a sip, and it is... a caramel apple cider! Okay. It was not what I wanted, but it is better than coffee. I actually got the drink that was supposed to go to the woman behind me. Why did they fill her order before mine? I do not think I am going back there for a while.]
