[111224665830567104550,100859999579490294880,Last summer while I was in Southern California visiting family, my wife’s aunt asked if I’d do her a favor and take her Cooper in for a service. I checked the local listings and found MINI of Universal City. I called and was please to get an appointment for the very next day. Being it was my first time at the dealer and their service area and that I’m not a Mini owner myself, I didn’t know what to expect. What I discovered was just how warm, friendly and prompt everyone was. From the young women at the service desk who checked me in to one of the young service managers (a Mr. Hall I believe was his name). Not only was I in and out of there on time, but the price they quoted me was also the price I ended up paying for the service. I informed my aunt and now she continues to take her car to this very dealer and has found out first hand what exceptional service they offer. Thank you MINI of Universal City.]
