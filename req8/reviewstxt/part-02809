[102174309530985141691,100303554980476482809,The people at Colonial were great: very professional, helpful, knowledgeable and concerned about me being satisfied with the vehicle and the deal. I tested several vehicles on the first trip there, but the timing wasn't right for my financial situation. They did not bug me at all. I returned several weeks later and they showed me more options and everything worked that time. I am very pleased with the vehicle and the deal. Highly recommend you do business here. GMC has set a new standard of excellence and luxury with Sierra. What a marvelous piece of engineering! Colonial is committed and experienced in helping make this an enjoyable and affordable experience. Ask for Paul.]
