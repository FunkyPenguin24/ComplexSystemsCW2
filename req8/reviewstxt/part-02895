[101412452527482702874,100308293016598091741,Taco Johns has a great selection of food that differs from taco bell. Their potato Oles area must have. I like mine with extra seasoning. * Open early for breakfast! Try their breakfast burritos. Bacon is my favorite, with ranch. I wish they were open later at night though. For my after bar close munchies. I think they close at 10pm. Open about 8am.]
