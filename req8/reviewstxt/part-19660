[115519979600052650919,100041860580300067071,Reviewed by Ainslie Watson-Gillis (Melbourne): I have no hesitation in recommending Maternity Revolution! Lisa was more than helpful, emailing me to keep me in the loop regarding my order. She was always professional, prompt and helpful in answering any questions I had. I spoke to Lisa on the phone as I was unsure about sizing and I found her to be warm & friendly, completely understanding of my needs, and honest about what Maternity Revolution could provide. I can't speak highly enough of their great service.]
