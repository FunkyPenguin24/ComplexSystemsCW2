Don't try to call to talk to admissions because no one will answer the phone, the receptionist (Missy) sounds asleep, and they will tell you that the best way to talk to someone is to just drive to the building, even though you live 2 hours away. You think since you were forking over all your money to go here that they would have some sort urgency to deal with any issues you may have with admissions. Steer clear.]
