[106496521769603142844,100001889427936561000,We stayed at the hotel last weekend while attending a Lacrosse Tournament. I am VERY picky where I stay. Your Hotel was wonderful! The staff was very friendly when we arrived and the nice girl at the front desk was helpful coordinating rooms close to another party we stayed with! Plus, Breakfast was great. Plenty of variety, fresh and HOT! The linens were clean and crisp, the bathroom was spotless and the towels were all WHITE! AND the Pillows were labeled "Soft" and "Firm". My only negative comment would be the firmness of the beds. WOW.. They were a little too hard. Maybe adding a pillow-top Mattress Cover would help :) Would DEFINITELY Recommend this hotel to anyone looking to stay in that area. Plus you are literally right down the street from Pocono Raceway! Will be back next year for our Fall Lacrosse Tournament!]
