[100520854396631974909,100884505261182039638,Closer to a 4.5. than a 4. We have a great time each time we come. There may be a wait occasionally, but the food tastes good, we've never gotten sick, and they have a happy hour at the perfect time (5-6:30PM). They're also close to home, so when we are craving sushi, we always come here. Not as fancy as some of the bigger places, but the service is attentive, and they're more than okay with families (read:small children) coming in for dinner. We'll keep going here as long as they're open.]
