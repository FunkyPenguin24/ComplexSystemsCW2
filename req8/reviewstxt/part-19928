[112960939724175972133,100055967563581403801,I've been here many times because I live down the street. People are right, the food is mediocre and way overpriced for quality EXCEPT for the nachos, they are really good! Also, the margaritas are good but you should opt for the more expensive ones. My favorite is the Hectorita made with 2 shots of tequilla and fresh squeezed lime juice served on the rocks in a tall glass for 11$. The atmosphere is very pleasant on the outdoor seating area on a sunny day. The service is also really good! They can get extremely busy on the weekends so you should be understanding if its slow.]
