[101909798490155481517,100995068252958615406,One of the worst experiences ever. Waiter Hong was terrible, poor service. Food was cold. No utensils, bibs, butter till we asked twice. No refills of water. No acknowledgement of birthday boy and they were told upon entering and while waiting for dinner, which took 45 minutes. Manager Lexi gave so so apology. No offer of free hush puppies as they were cold and a new order did not arrive until we were almost through with dinner. No offer of free dessert because of problems. DO NOT GO HERE! Corporate will hear from me.]
