[108922125878899691318,100428608318027661980,From the beginning to the end! I could not be more satisfied, being a Nissan Customer for about 14 years now, I have nothing bad to say about Hudson Nissan, I can honestly say that the entire staff from the minute you enter the lot whether it is for service or to buy a car they are there to help you and to accommodate your needs! As a Service Member I was very demanding!! (jajaja) And they went all the way. Special thanks to Jonathan Huffman, Josh (Internet Sales), Dennis and both Tim's in service, oh nad last but not least the Finance guy!.(sorry can't remember his name...but he'll push later) OOORAHH! These guys are Great and make you feel like you have known them for years therefor they take care of you. Thank You Hudson Nissan! Proud New owner of 2014 Nissan Pathfinder Platinum Premium!!! GySgt Gary J Betancourt USMC, Semper Fidelis!]
