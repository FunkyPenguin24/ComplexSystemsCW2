[100580433025928578898,100344292831628097759,This review is for North Little Rock: DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE - They should be shut down!!! I went to this place today to get my car washed. Short story, the job was not done correctly (large amounts left on front, back and side). I went back within 20 minutes to ask them to do it over again. The supposed manager (who actually turned out to be the the ticket writer) indicated that it would not come off and there was nothing they would do. I demanded that they correct it and to speak to a manager.. I was told there was nothing they could do and that I needed to leave. I asked for the owners name and his name and he provided me with a brochure with a number to call and told me his name was Cole. I told him I was not going to leave until I talked to the owner at which time he said that he was going to call the police because I was blocking the lane (there were no cars and I was not yelling or screaming or cursing, but I was determined to get satisfaction). We pulled off to an adjacent property and tried to reach the owners (we could not get them). While talking on the phone with the manager of the other shop in Little Rock where the owner was supposed to be.. 6 North Little Rock Police personnel approached my car and told me that I was potenital being charged with Criminal Trespass.. Criminal Trespass!!!! For complaining and asking that they do the job right?? In the end the police knew this was garbage.. I am in my car with my wife and 10 year old grandchild in a minivan.. I must have looked like a real threat. There actions were uncalled for, they did not even attempt to offer alternatives and in the end I was told not to come back... That my friends is a given, and I hope you don't either..]
