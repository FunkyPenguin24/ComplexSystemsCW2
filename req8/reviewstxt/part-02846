Rushed me in and out of his office incredibly fast to the point where I didn't have a chance to describe my problems, not that he cared. Wanted me to come in twice more for follow-up appointments. I went to the first one where he was as disinterested in me as he was the first time. Decided a second follow-up was not necessary, as I decided to find somebody else who didn't treat his patients as a total inconvenience.]
