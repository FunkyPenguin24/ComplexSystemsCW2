[111237208821691964593,100390364926556835556,We have purchased a new VW Golf 2012 during last week. The process was very clear, quick and straight forward. Neal Dossett, the sales manager, explained all the details. The location gives confidence. We were exchanging emails during the last year and without any question Neal replied to all of our emails on time and correctly. He also explained the process for the BMV for plate obtainment. Good to have locations like Mike Raisor and managers like Neal.]
