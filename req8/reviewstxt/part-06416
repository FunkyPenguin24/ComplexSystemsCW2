[105710670876577548154,100499692375793673671,Another review echoing tales of their poor customer service; the people who work at this store just aren't good people. I was shopping for shoes with my husband while nine months pregnant; the baby had dropped and everything. Naturally, I had to pee while I was there. I asked the cashier if I could use their bathroom, and he said no! He wasn't apologetic about it either; he actually rolled his eyes when I explained that I'm nine months pregnant and needing to pee causes a lot of pain. If you have ever experienced life with someone's head crushing your bladder you know how evil that man is!!! I wanted to walk out right then but the (lazy) salesgirl had just come back with my husband's shoes, which he needed for a wedding the next day, and they were 25% off, so they got the sale - but we are NEVER EVER EVER EVER going back there.]
