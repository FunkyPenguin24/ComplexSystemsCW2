[112872309978164658964,101143859773223533492,My experience at Monell's was partly my own fault for not entirely understanding what I was getting into when I was taken here with a group of friends. I had no idea that I would be shoe horned in with 18 other strangers around one medium sized table forced to sit in an awkwardly uncomfortable chair. Nor did I realize that there was one meal on the menu, buffet style deep fried fare. Nor did I realize that the "servers" at the establishment are really only there to plop dishes down on the table. From there you get to fight for your portions and selections with the other 17 folks at your table. If you want an experience that feels like you don't have two dimes to rub together and you're being forced to eat with your elbow heavy siblings around grandma's dining table on a sunday night, then Monell's is an excellent choice. However if you are like me and you have found gainful employment and chosen to eat out so that A) you can order your OWN meal; B) you can be waited on by the "wait" staff; C) you can speak openly and freely at the table with your peers without the hassle of strangers; or D) you want to check your phone during a meal THEN you should avoid Monell's at all costs. The insult to injury is that I had to sit in a cramped space with strangers while serving myself and the meal still cost $19.]
