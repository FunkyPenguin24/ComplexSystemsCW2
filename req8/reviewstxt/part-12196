[104542497717413120386,100811848493727887341,I love Pontillo's pizza and it's usually in my top 3 choices to order from when eating at home. The problem seems to be a disconnect between the various locations as far as menu items, quality, hours of operation, coupons, etc. I thought the idea of a franchise was to uphold the same standards of quality at each location but this isn't the case anymore. I live near the W. Ridge Rd. location, which I would not recommend to anyone, yet go a few miles in either direction to Latta Rd or Spencerport Rd and you'll get a great pie. I've also emailed the home office twice about my problems at W.Ridge Rd and never a reply so just stay clear of that one. Otherwise, enjoy!]
