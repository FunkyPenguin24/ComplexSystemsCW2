[104000704764484235910,100500544955226765091,Today my wife had a screw puncture the rear right tire on her Mini Cooper. I had never gone to any tire shop, Googled the nearest one, phoned this Kal Tire. The lady offered to either leave the car today at their location and they would take care of it before 6pm, or an appointment tomorrow at 9:30am. With me not having bought any tire from them in the past, I was quoted $20-$30 for the repair. I drove it there today. About 1 hr later it was done, much faster than what I expected. And the sales person made it at no charge as a gesture to thank me for waiting on site! Great service, nice people. I'll definitely go there next time I need anything about tires!]
