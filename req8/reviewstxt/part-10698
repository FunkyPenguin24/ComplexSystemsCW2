[114993684649177014984,100731503786955847992,I would not recommend the Toowong branch of this business to anyone. In the past I have had: - scratches and damage to the car - jobs explicitely requested at dispatch not executed - permanent attempts to up-sell in a most annoying manner - upon asking for work to be corrected, I was insulted by a man calling himself 'Dave', but unwilling to give a full name. "Dave" - Quotes: "You are a waste of time." "You will not get any useful information from me." - there is no business listing or address available (anonymous business) I cannot say anything about the quality of the other locations. But this one should be avoided. There are alternatives not to far away. Use Google Maps.]
