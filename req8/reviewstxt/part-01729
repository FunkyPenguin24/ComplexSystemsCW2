[101069246834079150816,100249027718356400260,I love Eastwind, James, Roger, Patty and the whole gang. Our small office use them not only for computer repairs but for networking. These men know their stuff and the staff is friendly, courteous, and extremely helpful. They don't try and sale you up, they give you what you need for a fair price. Thanks Eastwind, you guys rock!]
