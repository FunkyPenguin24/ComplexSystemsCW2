[102768668700009912166,100379281788058994641,Horrible! I have gone here 3 times and each time with a different hair stylist and and I will not come back. Each time has been a disappointment. A women even finished washing and cutting my very long hair in less time than a little boy's hair cut in the chair next to mine; and this boy was already in the chair before I walked through the door. She even told me she added a face frame to blend my bangs in when she finished. First off, you cannot do something with my hair before consulting with me first. You need to ask first with your reason then I can tell you if you can or cannot do something more to my hair. Sorry for the rant but I was very disappointed. I wish I got her name but I didn't.]
