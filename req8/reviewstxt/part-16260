The drinks are usually very good and decently priced, and perhaps that serves to dull the sting of the over-priced, bland, too-cheesy food. I knew I was in trouble when everything I received had a huge tortilla chip garnish stuck in it, like a sad flag of tex-mex defeat. If you order guacamole, expect to find lettuce packed at the bottom. A bowl of over-salted queso is $8. By all means, go celebrate with friends here, but I'd recommend sticking to the chips and salsa if you don't want to feel cheated (and go home with a bellyache). Service is average, worse when busy. The last time I visited, it took almost 25 minutes for the waiter to bring the check, return, and run my card. It was a Thursday night.]
