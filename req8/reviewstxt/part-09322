[114091685661762707081,100656749491859603781,One of my favorite restaurants since coming to Omaha a decade ago. The owner is a very kind and good man who when we dropped by after we got married waived the cost of dinner as a wedding gift. Great bang for your buck and one of the few Omaha Chinese places to do a good job on crab rangoons.]
