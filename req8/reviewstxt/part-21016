[103948445370022126809,100113567015648717583,Date of visit: 03/22/2012. First, let me say I have written over 250 published restaurant reviews. This place has to rate in 250th place. The worst buffet I have ever been to. It has gone downhill faster than skier Pickaboo Street. The food was awful. The wonton soup broth tasted like tap water. The wontons were brown on the top. You needed a microscope to find any chicken in the Chicken with Broccoli.. I even waited until a new tray was brought out. The beef in the Mongolian Beef was like rubber with no taste. The lo mein was greasy. The string beens were shriveled up and overcooked. Despite being a Thursday night, the food trays were empty most of the time. (this could have been a good thing) There was a sign by the ice cream saying "It tastes better on a cone" but there were no cones available. There were people eating from their plates while still at the food area...very unhealthy and even one person that literally finished his plate BEFORE he got back to his table. The manager/hostess was verbally fighting with the chef the entire time we were there. When she wasn't arguing, she was actually falling asleep standing up most of the night.. The ONLY bright spot was the friendly servers, which after reading other reviews is an improvement. I would advise you to try the other two buffets in Middletown but they are also below par. I would avoid Jumbo buffet at all costs. It was really horrible. Steve K.]
