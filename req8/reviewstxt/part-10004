[106592322607073876091,100693672443997303857,These reviews about the receptionists are surprising to me. Perhaps the office staff has changed since? I was helped by a woman named Heather and she was really nice and very patient with figuring out my insurance. The PA I saw was Kathryn Johnson and I think she's fabulous. Also the facilities are nice and I've never had to sit and wait forever for my appointment.]
