[101501059369494055994,101002792756444293193,For being the Sunday before Christmas, the service at Lil' Chef was great! Although they were busy, we were seated quickly, our drink glasses never quite made it to empty, and our breakfast was absolutely delicious - not to mention cheap! My boyfriend and I each had a hearty breakfast and our total was only a little over $15. This may have been our fist meal at Lil' Chef, but it definitely won't be our last. I can't wait to try the rest of their menu!]
