[108876170709661131530,100059706973143268151,Please disregard my ratings - I haven't been there but I had to enter something to post this question. We've reserved a beachfront bungalow at Baan Phu Lae for next month but I have a question based on some reviews on TripAdvisor. They were all from a few years about and they reported problems with bad bathroom plumbing and smells. Several also mentioned that there was no hot water in the beachfront bungalows. Can someone who stayed there recently comment on these problems? Did you have any of those problems? Overall it seems like there's been a huge turnaround after 2010 and since then the reviews have all been great. Any comments?]
