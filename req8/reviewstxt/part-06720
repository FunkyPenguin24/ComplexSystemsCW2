[100266198171035610265,100517712043497024328,Without question, this is the best medical practice group. All doctors in one place who work together to coordinate health issues specifically tailored to women's issues. The staff is always pleasant, professional and prompt. Doctors actually call you back, even when they aren't in the office! The level of care on a scale of 1-10 is a 12!!! I can't recommend this office enough. The acupuncture by board certified Internal Medicine MD is an added plus. Muscle issues that used to send me to physical therapy for weeks now take 2 sessions, and stress is alleviated through tiny needles better than any pill I could ever take. This is a real gem of a find.]
