[106535508670910270197,101140142492716837179,We spoke with Nick and he was both very knowledgeable and very helpful. We had brought our custom built tandem bike to M&M Cycling to get tuned up and fixed up and our first ride with the bike after this was near Activator Cycles. We needed to bring it in to Activator Cycles as when we got ready to ride we noticed the wrong tube was put in our rear wheel and we could not pump it up. The people at Activator Cycle were courteous and helpful, but also very genuine. They invited us both to ride with them in their evening rides and indicated how cool impressive the bike was. At M&M Cycling the owner had said our bike was a hodge-podge of parts and he thought it had been in an accident. Please if you are in the area bring your bike to Activator Cycles.]
