[100579228371217498056,100001644800852075116,Unfortunately my pizza was overcooked. The kids were picking off the burnt pepperoni. Apparently the cheesey bread has mayo on it and not butter. This was my first time ordering over the phone with this pizzeria. $40 for pizza, pop, and bread. Tip included. Not a good meal.]
