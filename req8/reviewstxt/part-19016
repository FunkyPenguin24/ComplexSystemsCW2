[111067195551964561571,100006795784587160407,This last summer, this restaurant came under new management and is phenomenal. The service was welcoming and friendly, and the food was fantastic! The fries are cut fresh daily and the burgers are delectable. The menu has some creative options, and it is also vegetarian friendly! We are new to Ashland, and this is already one of our favorite eateries in the city.]
