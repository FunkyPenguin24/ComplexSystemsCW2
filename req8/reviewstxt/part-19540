[100290065093949812647,100034962586046175713,Bought a used car here... they were very accommodating despite my young age. Dean LaFleur is on the ball and knows how to talk to his customers, so I had no problems at all buying from him. Aside from one little hang up I would rate this place as 100% awesome.]
