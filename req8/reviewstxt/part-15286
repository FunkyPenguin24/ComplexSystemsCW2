[103276011701213395999,100981622309566427185,Best dining experience in the Watkins Glen area. Both the food and atmosphere were incredible. I ordered the stuffed pork chop and my friend had a fish dish and both were delicious. A bit pricey but it is worth it. I will go back again on my next trip to WG.]
