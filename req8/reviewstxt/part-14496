[112568074159696486082,100939612372466820692,We have been working with Residential Rental Group for 5+ years now as owners. We find them to be efficient, resourceful and professional at managing our property. They also manage properties for two of our friends who are also quite happy with their services. Our last tenants liked RRG so much, they rented from them again when they were ready to move to a smaller home. Jeanna Cole, the owner, is great at diffusing situations. The entire staff is friendly and professional. The longer I work with them, the more I appreciate what they can do and how they do it.]
