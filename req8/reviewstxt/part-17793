[106301518173293263584,101119714642016038081,I have never had a Church family before but after attending Destination Church Chicago, I felt like it was finally possible. Everyone was so welcoming and genuinely interested in getting to know me. I did not feel any pressure but instead a welcoming embrace. If you need a home, I think Destination Church Chicago is it!]
