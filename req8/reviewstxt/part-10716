[114970534638104355686,100732433930618927736,Collectors Cache is the premier Card shop in the entire Midwest. Clearly they hold Yugioh Regionals and Magic PTQ inside their huge store. I Have traveled around plenty for pokemon (when I was younger) Yugioh (when I was a teenager and in high school) and I still do for Magic the Gathering. This shop is just the best I promise. If your shopping experience isn't up to snuff just ask them a question or email them. They will promptly respond. If you would like a specific item and they are out of stock just ask, they will order it just for you. They have also added the board game section and Minis including Warhammer 40K and Star wars. The staff is always friendly and are great people persons. The shop is locally owned forever (gosh its been there since 95th and metcalf and I believe before that too... ). As far as pricing goes, you CANNOT beat their sealed product prices (sleeves, boosters, fat packs, booster boxes, legendary collections, tins etc). The singles are priced right at market price most people use Ebay, which is always ever changing and hard to keep up with. In General, When I raise my kids, I would show them this wonderful shop and have fun!]
