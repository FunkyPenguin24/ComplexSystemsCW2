[117128177107108786528,100738479677551691033,Dr Bill is the best Vet I have ever had for my pets. The prices are very reasonable, cheaper than any other vet clinic I checked, and more importantly he was accurate at his diagnosis every time. I don't live in Ann Arbor anymore and having him taking care of my dog is one of the reasons I miss Ann Arbor so much.]
