[105785999559809121391,100543662498398604156,HORRIBLE PLACE!! I'm not one to write reviews about places, but this was totally unacceptable. I ordered flowers for my wife for Valentines day. When she gets on on V-day, I asked her how she liked her flowers... She NEVER RECEIVED THEM! This of course puts me in bad situation where it now looks like I didn't do anything for her! To say the least this ruined our 2nd V-day together as a married couple. The VERY LEAST they could do was call me and let me know. Also when I called to complain, their response was "we shut our system down so we didn't get your order. Would you like us to send it to her today?" WTF? Seriously, like sending her flowers today will get me out of the dog house!! I WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH THEM AGAIN, EVER.]
