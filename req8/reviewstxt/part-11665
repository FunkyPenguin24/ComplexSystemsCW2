[111986609161035825984,100783629587956962730,I've always taken my vehicles here for exhaust repairs and had a decent experience until today. Last week I called to see if my daughter could take her car in on a walk in basis or needed an appt. They said come in anytime. I asked if they had flex pipe for her car and they assured me they did. Friday of last week she takes her car in only to find out that they can't fix it that day. They COULD have taken 5 minutes to diagnose it and make sure they had the part, but didn't. Today she takes it in AGAIN, this is while working around a work and school schedule, only to be told they DONT have the part. At this point they've wasted my time and two days of my daughter's time. We won't take anything there anymore and I'll tell everyone I know to avoid this shop unless they have time for the typical auto repair bullshit you get at most shops. Sorry Ricks, you've gone way downhill. UPDATE: Just an update to my first review, we've now had the car fixed elsewhere at less than HALF the cost that Ricks quoted us. $75 to fix it vs. $160 quoted by Ricks. AVOID THIS SHOP!!!]
