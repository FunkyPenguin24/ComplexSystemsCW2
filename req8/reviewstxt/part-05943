[100649732367120935871,100473807477061686071,Super nice and so quick to fix the broken glass on my Michael Kors watch. They also replaced it with a higher quality one and put in a new water resistant band. I've been here previously to get links removed off my watches and I've always had a great experience. They're friendly and fix things on the spot. Definitely recommend this place to anyone in the downtown Toronto area!]
