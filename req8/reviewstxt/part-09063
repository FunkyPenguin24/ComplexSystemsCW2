[105937999322506148442,100642072713627690129,I've had the distinct pleasure of working directly with Bill and his executive team over the better part of 2010 and have to say I'm having a blast! Bill's got the charisma, he's got the desire, he's got the integrity, and best yet, he's got the smarts to continue to make a huge impact on the Medical Billing arena for Healthcare providers of all sizes... I've seen him do it.]
