[101288779016121503776,100432295844047676376,I can't say enough good things about Dr. Wyatt. I hate going to the dentist and Dr. Wyatt and his staff made me feel at home. Dr. Wyatt was able to get me in at a moment notice due to a tooth ache and made me feel at ease. He is by far the best dentist I have found. He takes the time to listen to you and explain everything that he will be doing. He is a very caring and a wonderful dentist.]
