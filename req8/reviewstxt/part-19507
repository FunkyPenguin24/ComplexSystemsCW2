[100731345297374852286,100033318003119823669,Hotel is good, although not as nice as The Chattanoogan. Staff is friendly, but the wifi is terribly slow, no excuse when you are in a city with some of the fastest Internet speeds in the nation. The wifi signal is also very poor. For comparison the wifi speeds at the Chattanoogan are in excess of 20mbps to the 1 mbps I get in my room.]
