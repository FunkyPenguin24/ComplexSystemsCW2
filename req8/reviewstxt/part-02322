[100921511515329939869,100278748956208811959,I used to visit Oxford 6 times a year for 7 years and ate lunch at Coco's most every day and dinner some nights. I loved the food, the ambiance, the staff and the decor.Never had a mediocre dish. I miss it. If I ever get back to Ox. I will certainly stop in and say hi to Simon.]
