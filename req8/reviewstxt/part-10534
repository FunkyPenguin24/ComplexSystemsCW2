[103178253360349715145,100722197437456625842,I needed my oil changed so I took my 2012 camaro to this dealership, oil change went good. Then they told me that there was a recall on it and to bring it back. I brought it back to have them fix the recall. They told me that the recall was an issue with the air bag so I thought that I should have this fixed. Turns out that the recall was not for my air bag, but the air bag light, which worked until this dealership got a hold of it. They said that they tried to fix it but was unable to because my stereo. They could not tell me why, just used my stereo as an excuse on why they messed up my air bag that no longer works. So because of this dealership I have a $50k camaro that does not have a working airbag. I have been arguing with this dealership and have been told if I want them to fix it back to how it was before I brought it there I will have to sue them. It is very sad that is what I have to do to get my camaro back to working safety. If you value your vehicle I would never take it here!]
