[103806715938848845711,100573389533760683859,I love the coffee shop feel of this place so much more than the chain Krispy Kremes or Dunkin' Donuts. The display is beautiful and the staff is very friendly. I've brought these into work three times, so far, and they've been a hit every single time. Some favorites are Tiramisu, German Chocolate, Key Lime Pie, Coconut Creme, Maple/Nutella Bacon, and Red Velvet.]
