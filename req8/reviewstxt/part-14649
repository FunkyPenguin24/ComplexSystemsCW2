[108635528953673462993,100947476199896930334,Do not stay at this hotel. While the water outage wasn't the hotel's fault, the manager refused to give us any money back for our horrible night without water. He was rude, and so meant to his employees two of them were in tears. He was one of the most uncaring people I've ever met. What makes me sick is that the hotel will no doubt file an insurance claim, therefore will be paid twice for their horrible service - once by the guests who went without water, and again by the insurance company.]
