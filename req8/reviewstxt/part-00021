[112300833266533779017,100159777912280735716,About a year ago, my company had a staff meeting at PJ's. Let's just say everything needed improvement. After hearing PJ's was under new management, I decided to give them another try. I ordered the same pizza as a year ago. Not only was it edible, it was AMAZING!! Garlic chicken pizza, thin crust with toppings and sauce all the way to the edges. I've since had a personal pizza with pepperoni sausage olives and mushrooms, again toppings almost over the edges. Some people like to have a lot of crust and that's fine, but if u want a great tasting crust that just enhances the flavors of the toppings, then this place is for you. There's so much more they offer also. The staff i have encountered are attentive, friendly and helpful. I plan to try the pasta, burgers and salad bar soon. I highly recommend PJ's !!!]
