[105836663997932086700,100142532590682430869,I got a smoothie (Sailor's Papaya) that was OK but it tasted way too flavourless; it probably had a lot of healthy stuff in it, to the detriment of any tastiness. The enviro was chilled, with nice music and people sitting at the bar. The service was way too slow, but there was also a lot of people behind the bar doing nothing. Each drink took 5-10 mins to make. If all the tables were full, they'd have no chance, and the people sitting at the bar would be crowded with people trying to order. There's plenty of other fast, efficient, healthy juice bars around. It shouldn't be hard to do the same plus some alcohol.]
