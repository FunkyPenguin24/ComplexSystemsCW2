[108915665933600877503,100983852727816605055,Good venue and idea but bad execution. Beer is bla, service is bad and food is not good. Ordered a medium rare bison burger with caramelized onions and mushrooms. Got a well well done, raw onions, with no flavor burger. My daughter's kids cheese burger was burnt to a crisp. I don't recommend this place to anyone.]
