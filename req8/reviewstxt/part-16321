[109167323838828791213,101037551884375745357,Absolute scam! My brand new car needed to be towed there for a clutch problem. They charged me $110 just to tell me it wasn't covered under warranty. When I disputed the claim with Hyundai Motors America the dealership continued to be completely unhelpful. Wouldn't tell me the problem with the clutch, just that it was operator error. Gave me an estimate for $1400 when every other repair shop quoted around $850. After lying to Hyundai Motors America about the condition of the car, they then charged $35 a day for the car being on the lot while the claim was processed. Terrible experience. Creating a complaint with the Better Business Bureau against them.]
