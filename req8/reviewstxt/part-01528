[101158824500999540711,100237334251063467046,The customer service at the Omni Hotel in Forth Worth is awesome! We have been to two conferences at this hotel within the past year, and all the staff members are extremely nice, have a smile on their face, and go out of their way to assist you. You don't have to walk around looking for someone to help or ask a question, as they have plenty of staff on-hand and are easy to locate at any time of day or night. The food is great and the rooms are nice/clean as well. We would definitely recommend this hotel!]
