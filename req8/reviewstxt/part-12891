[107710573575684665312,100851216955374362270,Service was above average. The front desk clerk was nice and gave us a number for a dependable cab company. She was even nice on the phone when I called to say we were running behind and wouldn't make the 3:00 checkin. Room and bathroom were clean and modern. The next morning we enjoyed a great continental breakfast with a happy and helpful attendant. I would recommend this hotel to those visiting State College!]
