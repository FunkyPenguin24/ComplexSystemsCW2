[116241555750563674434,100486032959580212758,I went for the first time in 2012/13 and had so much fun that I bought a season pass this year. The drive from Minneapolis is worth it. It has to be on your bucket list, right next to Snowbird and Jackson Hole. Thought the vertical is shorter than most amazing ski resorts, this one is up there with the best of them. It has to be experienced!]
