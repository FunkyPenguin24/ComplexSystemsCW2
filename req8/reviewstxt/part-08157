[108190471964997814687,100596295140644847799,My wife and I stopped here for breakfast on our last visit to Scottsdale. The store is very small, but the food was excellent! My wife raved over the homemade croissant her sandwich was on, and my omelette was fantastic. We also had a great time chatting with the owner and learning more about how the cafe got started. Can't wait to visit again to try the Arizona Benedict!]
