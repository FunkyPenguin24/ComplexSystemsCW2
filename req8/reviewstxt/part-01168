[100303107110280649117,100219758435514657892,I can say that we had a very positive experience with Grizzly Hackle. The fly fishing guide, Dan did a great job of showing us around and giving us some pointers on fly fishing. Their store is also a must visit! Friendly service from employees that are obviously into fly fishing.]
