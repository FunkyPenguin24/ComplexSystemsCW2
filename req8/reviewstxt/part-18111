[100744955582557374578,101135706152705347316,Julia’s German Stammtisch Serves Authentic German Cuisine in Columbia Worthy of the Experience. It is a family owned and operated business with a reputation for serving the best schnitzel you will get short of going to Germany! You should be aware of is that it is a “Cash Only” business that does not accept credit or debit cards! But it was one of the best meals we've had in Columbia for a very long time. It is tucked away in a small and decrepit strip mall off Jackson Blvd., but once you get inside the restaurant is clean and the food is lovingly prepared to order. If you are not familiar with German food, then don’t hesitate to ask the wait staff for some detail, as certain items may be more bland or spicy than the corresponding American style dish. My favorite is Julia’s Double Decker, which consists of two lightly breaded pork schnitzels layered around lean ham and smothered in cheese sauce. It comes with a wonderful salad and rolls before the meal and choice of side dish (i.e., red cabbage, german potato salad, home fries, spatzle or sauerkraut). Another good choice is the Bratwurst, which are not the run of the mill variety from the local grocery. Overall the food was great and more than either of us could finish. We will definitely eat here again!]
