[100022736984933864474,100987126070034463453,I LOVE this salon. I have been going to get my haircut from Cherie for my entire life. She gave me my very first haircut as a baby; I'm 25 years old now! I love that the salon stays up-to-date on the newest styles. Cherie has also done a fantastic job at up-do's (when I went to prom, my sister's wedding, and my own wedding) and make-up. The ladies at the salon are all very friendly and personable and would reccomment this place to anyone, guys included!]
