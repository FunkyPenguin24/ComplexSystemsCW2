[107750314026241371587,100095599916350200900,The pancakes are absolutely amazing, topped with vanilla ice cream, they were my wife's favorite. The Loco Moco is pretty fantastic. The portions were huge, you cannot leave there hungry unless you are ridiculously finicky. My wife and I had our honeymoon on the North Shore, Papa Ole's made our memories a little more fun.]
