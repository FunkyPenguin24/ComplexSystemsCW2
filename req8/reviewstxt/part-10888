[101500207092281848524,100741332349325585537,First off I would like to note I never leave bad reviews, but this one merits it. This was by in far the worst experience at a salon I have ever had. I was in a rush and this place was right next to my house, so I took a chance. I went in to get my bangs trimmed, simple enough. The stylist CUT MY BANGS PAST MY EARS, she gave me a mullet. It was so awful I had to go get extensions to cover up what she had done. Don't go here . . .]
