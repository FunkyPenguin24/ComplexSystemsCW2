[114562439430480177388,100865225837340868117,Very rude, & horrible customer service. They're changing workers every 3 months, and the quality of work they do is less than commendable. I had to request a guy to re-file my nails several times to TRY to get them to a normal-looking shape. My nails came out in several different shapes! Then, when I complained, they started gossipping in their native language, and several of the other workers looked my way laughing. They may be fast, but their quality of work, and customer service is horrible. Never again!]
