[118300896694018853485,100224399644596561509,We bought our first vehicle in the 80 s from Mahaffey Ford in Conroe. Gullo purchased Mahaffey. Over the years we have purchased several vehicles from Gullo Ford. This time I had been searching for the vehicle I thought I wanted and dealt with several other dealerships over a 6 month period. I finally told my husband, lets go to Gullo. I trust them. We where not disappointed. They treated us like family. They did not rush us to make a decision on vehicle, in fact they coached us to look at several. We test drove the Ford Flex and fell in love it with. We are a Ford family, my husband still proudly displays his Ford Tough Boulevard sign on our garage. It is very comforting to know that you can trust a dealership who employees do look out for your best. You don t find that any where any more. During our car search we dealt with Morgan, Steve, Brett and Benjamin. I can t speak highly enough of these fine individuals. They are genuine professionals who care about you, their customer. I have no problem recommending anyone to visit Gullo and see for yourself the difference.]
