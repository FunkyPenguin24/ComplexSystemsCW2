[117853420280640164765,100842080478081551003,I live for Mexican food and eat it constantly when we go out. I've tried many places from Texas city to league city. This is by far my favorite! Before this, nothing beat going to San Antonio for Mi Tierra...but this restaurant is just as good! The food is excellent...margaritas amazing... and the staff is stupendous! We know the waiters, waitresses, and other staff by name now, they know what we like, and are prompt to make sure we haven't changed our minds for that day then get everything out to us in great time. Bar section in front is smoking so i love going there since its one of the few places i can still have Margaritas and smoke without having to go outside. They don't make you feel Rushed there... we usually spend a good hour and a half with them about once a week.]
