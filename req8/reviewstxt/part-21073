Upon arrive were greeted by the hotel valet staff that assisted us with our luggage. The staff at the front desk was extremely helpful with the check in process. The room was very spacious with high ceilings; the room d√©cor was very pleasant. I would overall rate this hotel experience as one of my best. The staff at The Tremont House were outstanding and the property was well maintained. The Tremont House was a perfect ending after our seven day cruise on Carnival Magic. 2/16/2014]
