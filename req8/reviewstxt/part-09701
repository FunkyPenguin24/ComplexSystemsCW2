[102742310327282776258,100676751258524003727,This is my family's favorite restaurant in Harrisburg. We love to go for breakfast, brunch and lunch. They are open on Friday and Saturday nights now which is nice too! Excellent food and at a very reasonable price! We love everyone in there. The food is consistently good and service is exceptional. Sometimes they get busy and you might wait a little longer than usual, but that's because it isn't a secret that this place is GREAT!]
