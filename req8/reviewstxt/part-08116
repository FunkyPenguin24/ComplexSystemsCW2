She really enjoyed her consultation, how clearly everything was explained to her, and how the staff and Doc tried to connect with her on topics she loves - like fiction about cats. My daughter usually has a lot of anxiety in any medical office, but she felt comfortable and even went as far to say how much she liked the practice after her consult. As a parent, I was very impressed as well. Nice people helping people get their best smile. "]
