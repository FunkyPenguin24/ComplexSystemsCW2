[117920111021351611449,100425748916515630435,I've been here on several occasions for local shows, and every visit has been pleasurable. Drink prices aren't over the top, the pool tables and sticks are in good condition, and the sound is amazing. You'd be hard pressed to find a better place in the Winter Park area to attend (or play) a show. Their sound engineer is top notch.]
