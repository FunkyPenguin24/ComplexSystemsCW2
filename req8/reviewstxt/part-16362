[108057781120303790531,101040119083585379581,This was, by far, the best experience my wife and I have ever had buying a car!! Karen Tittle was awesome, as was Tracy Brown in finance!! Almost everything was handled over the phone, and we basically walked in, signed the papers and drove out!! We have found a dealership worth dealing with!!]
