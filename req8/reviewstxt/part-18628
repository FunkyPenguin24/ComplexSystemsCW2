The back counter is where the action is and where you'll get your in-and-out, ripper or cremator hot and fresh. The relish is a must on these. The fries and onion rings are as good as they get. I've been going to Rutt's Hut since the late 70s. It hasn't changed, probably never will and shouldn't. This is as Jersey as it gets.]
