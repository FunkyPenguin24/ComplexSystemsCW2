[113500198571710541748,100598620045191398893,The TV I wanted wasn't available anywhere local, and I wasn't having any luck with the big online names. So I scoured the net and found East Coast TVs. I ordered my 55" HDTV on 6 Feb - the website stated that 5 were in stock. After I placed my online order I received the confirmation email. About 30 minutes later I received a call from Steve to verify delivery address and shipping options. I was actually glad he called because he made me aware of an error I made on the delivery options, so we were able to get that resolved quickly. There was no pushy upsell, and Steve was a pleasure to talk to. The TV was delivered about 2 1/2 weeks later - there was some delay because of the weather. The delivery guys brought the TV in, unpacked it, set it up where I asked them to, and turned it on to make sure it works. They also had me inspect it to make sure nothing was broken. The next time a big ticket item I'm looking for isn't available locally, I'll go with these guys first. Thanks Steve!]
