[100142195052789110065,100135380921925123666,Had a very good experience here.. Room is very nice and clean. For being a pet room, there are no odors or stains on the floor. Front desk clerk was very helpful on the phone prior to arrival, and accommodating when we arrived. Room Service was fast, had hot food, and was delicious. No problems with our pets staying here and let us park our fifth wheel out front. Pool and hot tub were enjoyable and had towels available. Bathrooms very clean throughout hotel.. Shower pressure was perfect and overall this was just an amazing hotel and stay!]
