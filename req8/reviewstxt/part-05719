[110410974924214078108,100462153539066864732,All I can say is Nathan is THE BOMB! I had shopped at a few used car lots and felt like the majority of the salesmen were "lying creepers" that just were basically hungry to take advantage of women. Well to make a long story short, I found Nathan online, called him and he made me feel so comfortable on the phone, from the beginning, that I knew I was in good hands. Nathan really listened to what I wanted. So I decided to see what he could do for me, considering I had bad credit, no $ down and my car was in such bad shape that I couldn't even drive it to look for another vehicle. So Nathan was so amazing, he arranged to have the car I was interested in, brought to me. I test drove it, and told him I loved it! About 90% of the entire process was completed before I actually went to the dealership. Time was really important to me, because I didn't have much of it and Nathan completely understood. Once I arrived at the dealership, I was greeted with a HUGE hug and complete efficiency. I was nervous about this purchase until I met Nathan. He was confidant that I could get this car and made me feel comfortable and happy with my decision. I am know that if I need anything, Nathan will be there to help. Thank you, Nathan for making this car buying experience a positive, smooth and successful one. P.S. Will you marry me?]
