[101490089297973200554,100812363194617390884,We are in Salida just about every weekend and have tried many of the restaurants in the downtown area and the Boathouse Cantina is my favorite! I am a gluten free vegan and I have never left this place unsatisfied! I am completely addicted to the cilantro vinaigrette as well as the jalapeno-cilantro sauce. As a matter of fact, I had to go in and get little to go containers of both of them before we left Salida to return to Denver - I can't go a full week without it! The portebella sandwich is great - the gluten free buns are nothing to be excited about, but that isn't their fault - gluten free buns in general suck - maybe if they toast them, they would be better...Oh - and for the non-gluten free people in your group, the Boathouse folks are serious about their beers! They have many great beers on tap and they serve them in the proper glass (something about the best glass for the bubbles...) And the house Cab is great, too! This is the only place I want to go to anymore when we are in Salida (with the occasional dinner at Little Cambodia when she makes me my veggie pho broth!). Definitely check this place out, it is AWESOME!]
