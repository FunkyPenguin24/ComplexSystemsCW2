[118156005058193097560,100797361810878524281,Blackland Prairie District of BSA Capitol Area Council does two camps here every year, and the sites are outstanding. Beautifully trimmed and plenty of shade under the pecan groves. The hike and bike trail is well maintained and educational. We always spot wild life and the boys have a great time! Ranger Tim Spyer is helpful and very friendly. And being so close to Pflugerville, Hutto, and RR drop off and pick up of the kids is a breeze.]
