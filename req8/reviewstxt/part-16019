[100141479840007566951,101021777285953974521,Iam 47 and Watched from the window of my store as people ran by day after day, until one day I had the courage to ask what everyone was doing. I found Crossfit…. WOW..It’s amazing how it has changed my life. I was out of shape, unhappy and a little bored. Not now..I have more energy and Iam getting in great shape, I also was Able to compete in the Warrior Dash thanks to CrossFit North Pacific. I have a bunch of new friends my age, older and younger...The workouts are always a blast, Polly & Dave are simply the best, always there to encourage, support and motivate you. One of the things I love about CrossFit North Pacific is the awesome support you get from everyone who is working out with you. We are a TEAM and no one feels alone….]
