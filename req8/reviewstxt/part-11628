[115385964017232239273,100781683095499440147,The mall was great to visit and yes, I wound up buying a lot of items! It's worthwhile (to me) to try something on before buying it as opposed to just ordering clothing online. Finding a parking spot was easy due to the available space indicator lights above every space. On a side note, motorcycle parking fee is the same as automobiles. So if you ride there with one or more other motorcyclists, you'll have to each get a parking ticket even though you'll most likely be using a single parking spot. Went with my fiancee this past weekend and rode our motorcycles instead of driving the car. We picked a single ticket upon entering as we knew we'd both fit into a single parking space. Upon exiting, we were delayed almost 10 minutes at the exit gate by an attendant that stated we needed two tickets to exit. The exit gate would simply not accept my parking ticket. It displayed "unreadable" and I'm not sure if it was smart enough to sense two motorcycles or just couldn't read my ticket. A couple of calls to the main office by the attendant, resulted in the barrier arm being raised and we were allowed to leave at no cost. Great customer service for having been delayed/inconvenienced but a revised parking plan for motorcycles would be nice.]
