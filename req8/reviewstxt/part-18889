[103658612708750448618,100000836613090304639,From the time I first met Chris at Blue Moon Entertainment to our last meeting before the big day I felt he truly understood how I wanted our wedding day to go. He really listened and took what I had to say to create the exact picture in my head I had been imagining my whole life. He created the party of a lifetime and kept it going from when we said I do to the last dance. The dance floor was packed the entire night and he even got my "husband" to sing to me at our wedding. I never thought that was possible. It was truly the best day of our lives. He made our dreams come true. Everyone is still raving about how much fun the night was. A sincere thanks. I would never trust my day to anyone else. He truly understands weddings and how to make your dreams come true.]
