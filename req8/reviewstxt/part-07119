[101606071164640606063,100538675688487393859,Kington is a delight. Climbing the hill to England's highest course, enshrouded in mists in early April I wondered what I had let myself in for- a feeling that only increased, despite a friendly welcome at the pro shop, as my crisp tee shot on the first caught the brow of a steep hill and rolled back at least 60 yards. I had come for the fantastic views and all I could see was mist and mizzling rain. Battling on, the golfing gods must have smiled on this lone player who had travelled miles to play here, for trudging up the eighth hole, Bradnor Rise, the clouds lifted and shafts of sunlight began to break through. By the time I putted out for my par on Bryn Awelon, the short ninth, the views across Hergest Ridge were sensational. Despite greens that were disappointingly sluggish (otherwise this would be a nailed on five stars) the back nine were a joy. At 14, appropriately named Whole View, I could see the Black Mountains, the Brecon Beacons and the Malvern Hills. It is hard not to enjoy a round in a place like this when the sun shines. And shine it did right up until the last hole, an exhilarating 283 yard par four down hill ending up below the clubhouse windows. And reader, I drove it, narrowly missing an eagle two before tapping in for a birdie and off for a pint of excellent cider in one of the most friendly and welcoming club houses. I had had a wonderful time on a first rate course. I cannot wait to play it again, and only hope the sun will shine on me once more like it did on this early April morning.]
