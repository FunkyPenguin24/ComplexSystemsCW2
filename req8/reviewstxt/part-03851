I usually get like tons but I could barely even eat the two I put on my plate. The cream cheese part was gross and dry, probably the worst filling I've had. I didn't even eat the wonton part. All the chicken was cold and kind of gamey, not moist at all. The green beans were wrinkly? Like how long had those things been sitting there???? My boyfriend had the potstickers and he described them as being both mushy and hard. Not sure how you can accomplish that. I didn't even try them, they looked gross. Now we were there after the regular dinner crowd (about 7:30) but I can tell that even if this food was at its freshest, it wouldn't taste good. Also, our waitress was clearly on her phone back in the waitress station thing, plus the woman up front at the register did nothing but sit on her phone and was rude to my boyfriend when he gave his opinion of the food. We won't be going back there!]
