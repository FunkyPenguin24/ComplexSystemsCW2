[113457001740087450685,100937171448314251430,Was passing through McGregor and just looking for anything to eat when I stumbled upon this place. The restaurant is very clean with a nice bbq-joint-meets-sports bar atmosphere (minus the bar). I had the chopped brisket sandwich and my g/f had the smoked turkey sandwich. The sandwiches were served dry, so you're feel to put as much or little BBQ sauce as you like. The two sauces at the tables were tasty in their own ways. Also had a side of mac'n'cheese that was also delicious. It wasn't smothered/swimming in fake cheese like many bbq joint tend to do. Instead, it was a lighter macaroni with real melted cheese on top. I like to eat on the healthier/lighter side so I appreciated that (as well as the sandwiches served dry). Last, all the staff was upbeat and friendly. Such a great place!]
