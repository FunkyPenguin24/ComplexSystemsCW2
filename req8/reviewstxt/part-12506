[108620380186349731088,100828534486363101494,By far the best car buying experience. After all, purchasing a new vehicle should be fun right? My wife and I walked in about 45mins before they closed on a Saturday and asked if we could look around. Allison greeted us in the front and let us browse the inventory on our own telling us if there was anything we were interested in to let her know. We found the car we loved and Allison had someone pull it around for us. When we returned Allison asked what we thought. Never being pushy or reminding us they closed soon. I asked If I could talk to the finance folks about purchasing and I then found out that everyone in there does everything. Allison took us to her office, found us a great interest rate and 15 minutes later we were leaving in our new car :) --- believe it or not I don't typically leave reviews but this place is so awesome I will refer everyone I know--- Thanks Allison, we love our new ride.]
