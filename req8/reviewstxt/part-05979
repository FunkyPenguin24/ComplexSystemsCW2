[101292909231456607778,100476363376275732519,My experience with Autoway Toyota has been nothing but excellent. I have had 2 Highlanders, 1 Corolla and now a brand new 2013 Toyota Camry. The car is awesome and my sales rep Scott Tanke was fantastic at helping me with all questions I had. He also took the time to explain the radio and show me how to use it, as it appeared complicated at first glance, but it's not. He connected my cell to the Bluetooth for me and off I go. It was a great experience and they are wonderful to work with.]
