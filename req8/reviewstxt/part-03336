[106026942681383811052,100331549961203914621,I was on the fence about buying a new car because the offers I was getting from other Honda dealerships weren't that great. My sister had recently purchased a car at Moon Honda and said her experience was great and I should check them out. I'm glad I did because they were very willing to work with me and I ended up purchasing a car that I'm excited about and they gave me the best price!!]
