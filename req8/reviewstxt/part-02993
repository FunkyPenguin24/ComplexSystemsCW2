[101012275065878894989,100314090027977725046,great food, great decor, amazing atmosphere! their Carne Asada is some of the best I've ever had. Guacamole is to die for. and everything else I've ever had I've loved. know the owner well, and before he opened this place he went to mexico and lived with a woman for 3 months, she taught him and 3 of his staff how to cook. cant get any more traditional than that. love this place!]
