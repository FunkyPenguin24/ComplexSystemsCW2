[109670434288453429132,100085687517778911473,I recently went to Rick Hendrick Chevrolet in Buford, GA and I was really pleased with the service. The staff was knowledgeable and answered all of my questions and were extremely patient. I was originally contacted by Andre Henry. I was already considering getting rid of my car and was searching for a great used car that was affordable. He was very personable and I could tell that we was not just trying to take my money. Overall I've had a great experience with them thus far and I'm looking forward to finding my next dream car!]
