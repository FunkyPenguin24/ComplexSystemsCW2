[112351906492929910179,100984541858889896094,I love this place. I walk in, they ask me what kind of beer I want. I never have to wait…my appointment always starts on time. Rachel is amazing at cutting hair and a great conversationalist too. I'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't trust thrifty cuts with their hair. Grandpa always told me, "You get what you pay for"…and it seems to be true at The Parlour.]
