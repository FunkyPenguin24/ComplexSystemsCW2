[107724885381097275677,100372599018583634283,I have been a client at Paul Joseph's for over 5 years now. My stylist, Christina is amazingly talented and so professional. She is so passionate about hair and is always current on new styles and trends. People always ask me where I get my hair done and I immediately refer them to Christina or Paul Joseph's in general. The atmosphere is great and everyone is so nice and accommodating. Several of my friends and my aunts are now clients. I wouldn't trust anyone else with my hair!]
