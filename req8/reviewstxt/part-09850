[100264532799334743259,100684622614156756168,Dr. Grimm has been a godsend to me! I started seeing Dr. Grimm more than 3 years ago and his adjustments to my neck and back as well as the exercises he taught me have brought me so much relief. After years of suffering with pinched nerves and many other doctors telling me there was nothing they could do for me. Now I rarely get pinched nerves, the pain has subsided and I can turn my head without being in agony. God Bless Dr. Grimm. Update - now I work with Dr. Paul! He is a wonderful person; he truly cares and will do everything in his power to help your body heal and keep you healthy!]
