[114903249144883176937,100228480509024762850,My family & I had a great stay (3 nights Fri-Sun) at the Fairfield Marriott a couple weeks ago! The rates were excellent, especially when you factor in Free shuttles to Sea World/Aquatica AND Free breakfast every morning! But the main reason for my review is to give thanks & high praise to one of their managers, Kevin, who epitomizes what customer service should be (but often is not)! Kevin noticed me hauling luggage up the stairwell to our 3rd floor room & asked if he could help me. I politely refused as I felt I could manage what I was carrying. Then when I got to the room, he asked if there was anything else he could do for me & I mentioned the loose lock on our room door. He said he'd be right back & 5 minutes later, he arrived with a drill & tightened our loose lock in moments! THEN he asked if we needed a recommendation for dinner. He recommended a local mexican food restaurant & gave us explicit directions, so we went there to grab dinner & the food & service were both excellent! On another day, some (frankly whiny) guests were complaining about missing breakfast at the front counter & I heard him offer to get some breakfast items (eggs/bacon) from the already closed kitchen. Wow! Kevin is the kind of employee every company should hope for- such a positive, hard-working attitude! Thank you Kevin! We'll be back next summer if not sooner! -Brian Bailey, Austin, TX]
