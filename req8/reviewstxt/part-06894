[113916259533172070814,100527237542445239845,This past week I had the wonderful experience of staying in the Historic B&B's Heritage House! I stayed in the Rose Room which is a beautifully appointed and elegantly decorated gold and red bedroom with an adjacent sitting room. The bed was super comfy and I greatly appreciated the fact that each bedroom is individually climate controlled. Each of the four breakfasts I enjoyed were bountiful and delicious. I feasted on fresh fruit, amazing organic egg dishes, crisp bacon and sumptuous pancakes. But best of all, I loved the warm reception and attention I received from the Grant family! I look forward to returning to Albuquerque and this charming exceptionally well run B&B!]
