[113985832197853939721,100624819306638206270,I hurt my back the first time some years ago. My Dr gave me pain meds, mucle relaxers, inflamaition meds,steroids,stuff to make it feel better. In febuary of 2012 i woke up one morning and couldnt get out of bed. Worst pain I ever had.My Dr prescribed the same things, sent me for an M.R.I and to a spine specialist,who gave me meds and added thearapy. 9 mos of thearapy and very little improvement. The day after christmas I woke up and couldnt get out of bed.... I finnaly took my daughters advice and went to Dr Overton.WOW!!!!!!!! I am in my 5th week of rehab with him and I still cant believe the difference.I am not on any medications, and 90% better already. Chiropractic is the way to go, and when you do, go see Dr O!!!!!! DR Overton and his staff are some of the nicest people I have ever met, and they always make me feel that they care about ME. I will continue to look forward to my appointments with them. They turn my frown upside down :)]
