[109378064192740789105,101127349596215602303,I'm really glad that my wife and I were referred to Medical Park Family Care by a friend upon our arrival here in Anchorage. They offer a fairly comprehensive range of services, including mole examination and removal - which, for a person with a large number of moles, is a huge help. Local dermatologists always seem to be backed up for months, so if something changes I know that I can get an appointment *within days* if necessary to have it examined and removed for examination by a pathologist. The doctors and nurses have been courteous and attentive every time I've been in. Checkin and billing have not been problematic for me. If I ever do have a negative experience I won't hesitate to share it, but so far, so good.]
