[117986456022603852414,100737390465564124694,I've been dining at Rivera's for over ten years, i must say that i'm surprised at some of the bad reviews they've gotten. This food is definitely some of the best in the area and its always hot and fresh, and some complain about the prices but with quality food comes higher prices(which aren't too steep by the way) but the variety of dishes is one of their strong points, i'm always trying something different and I am never let down . The service is friendly and fast and the food doesn't take long either. The margaritas are good and especially worth it on Mondays and Tuesdays when they're $1.99 and Wednesdays they have $2 beers. This place is definitely worth a try and its one of my personal favorite places to eat' so I'd recommend stopping by and seeing for yourselves.]
