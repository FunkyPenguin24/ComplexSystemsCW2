[101264939577582392592,100242985727353184982,Very bad Mother's day experience. Wife ordered the special, steak was not their typical cut (much smaller), and was freezer burned. Tasted sour, and was supper fatty. Brought it to their attention, they made another steak, this one was cooked correctly, but still freezer burned. On top of that we waited 45 minutes for them to box or food and a check. Their answer for this was to offer us a desert we didnt want. On top of that the steak and scallops special was ober $27, with definitely lower quality meat.... Thanks for the mother's day memories.]
