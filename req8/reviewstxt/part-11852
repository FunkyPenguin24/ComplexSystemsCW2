[105075343052328624638,100793166660343630277,We had a refrigerator whose circuit boards were whacking out. I called on a weeknight and received an immediate response the following morning, with an offer to come check out the fridge that afternoon. The inspection was done, the parts were ordered and received, and the repair was complete three days after the original call. We were very happy with the result. Chuck called a few weeks later to follow up and make sure everything was still working to our satisfaction. Highly recommend.]
