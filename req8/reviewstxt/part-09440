[113617942289593479145,100663060089961658750,AMAZING!!!!! OMG I had been to 10 other bridal boutiques and none of them made me feel as beautiful as Renee’s. Sara and Renee helped me and their positive energy was incredible. Renee was so creative and Sara was fun! Their gown selection was varied which was nice. Renee’s goal seemed to be that she would do whatever it would take to make me happy and she succeeded! I bought my dress there yesterday. I’m so excited for my wedding for the first time through this entire planning process.]
