[102159476513551651273,100135930596516021818,I, like most pet owners, would do just about anything for my furbaby. When I take my pet to Ingersoll Animal Hospital, I have every bit of confidence that their caring staff of office personnel, techs, and veterinarians care as much about Stella as I do. The vets take time with her, thoroughly explain everything they are doing, address any concerns I may have, and provide practical tips for follow-up care. I appreciate their expertise in animal care and humble nature as people who love animals as much as I do. I would recommend Ingersoll Animal Hospital to anyone who seeks affordable, thorough, and genuine care for their pets. They make me feel like Stella and I are their number one priority each time we go in. Hands down the best animal care facility in the Des Moines metro!]
