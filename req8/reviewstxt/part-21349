I ordered wood flooring to be installed by Home Depot and it has been nothing but a nightmare since the minute they took my money. It has taken way longer than they told me it would take. They dropped the ball twice in contacting me to let me know about when the wood would be delivered -- it has to be there 3 days in advance of the install. They can't seem to find the number of the company that delivers the wood or installs it so I have to play the middle man for them. I don't go to Home Depot to do all the work for them -- I go so they can handle talking to their contractors and work out the details. I shouldn't have to do this. Never have them install anything as this store -- and Home Depot in general -- can't seem to manage its own contracted companies (I had the same problem when we had them install counter tops).]
