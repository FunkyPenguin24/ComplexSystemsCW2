[100028634053777976632,100417993970483516792,I LOVE THIS PLACE. In my experience, its very hard to find a restaurant that has really good wings. Barleycorns' wings blew off my socks. I highly recommend trying the Doc Style wings! They literally are super hot and super crispy. It's a pet peeve of mine when other places smother their wings with so much sauce that you can't even taste anything else! In my opinion, its a GOOD thing that Barleycorns doesn't do that because they wouldn't have these amazing wings! A++]
