[113481128425300351423,100273832865963425536,I am a new bike owner. I went into Berts just to look around and see what's out there, since I had never been out in the bike market before. The salesman at the door, Kennedy was great, he was super helpful showed me around and didn't make me feel like a moron. I did some research, went back again to sit on a few more things and met a different salesman, Dino. My experience with him was not as enjoyable. He could tell I was new and was trying to do whatever he could to get me to buy his bikes, today. I told him my price range, and was immediately told that there was no way I could get a sports bike for $4,000. When I told him where I had already found some his tune instantly changed and he was willing to discuss a bit more. I however was instantly turned off. The prices at Bert's for me personally were just too high. I found what I liked, went to craigslist and found my bike there, for under $4,000. I would go back there to shop, but probably not buy unless the price was right. Now that I am smarter I am better prepared for the salesmen of Bert's Mega Mall, before I felt like I was being taken advantage of, especially by the second guy. Bert's is huge and they don't need my money, and they made that clear based on how I was treated, the first guy brought me back, the second guy helped make my decision to look elsewhere. Overall, Bert's is a great place to look, a great place to sit on a bunch of different things, and if you have the money a great place to buy. If you're new to the bike scene get educated and be careful, and if you have a strict budget, get real familiar with Craigslist.]
