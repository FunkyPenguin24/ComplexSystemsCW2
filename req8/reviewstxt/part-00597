[114562357110390604305,100190797135087501671,This little storefront shop next to Publix has changed names/ownership several times, but the quality has never changed. They have great pizza and even better baked goods. Their pizza is true New York style and the baked goods would rival any found in a New York bakery. Try the Lobster Tail and the Canoli!!]
