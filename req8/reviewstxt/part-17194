[116037235224726052175,101086687546742612058,The service from the opticians in Asda St Austell is some of the worst I have ever experienced. Enven though they new we had an issue with the gasses thay had supplied and we called and made an appointment by telephone we were not expected and not seen by a memeber of the optician team but a deputy store manager made his best efforts but didn't understand the issues at all. A wasred journey and a waste of time. Very poor customer service.]
