[114457044285414780315,100356848203169229659,I would like to give a HEARTY THANKS to Matt @ Rose City Motors - Fort Wayne on Lima Rd. He and his whole team were very patient over the past few weeks. Bought an older Mazda earlier in the year from a buy here/pay here. It was junk. Things were wrong with from the get go. Engine, suspension, cyclinders, brakes, etc. That car was a mess. Last week, it started making grinding noises. With winter coming, I didn't want to worry about my family's safety. I HAD to get a better car. We went to several other places and filled out credit apps, only to be forgotten or told there wasn't any way they could help. Driving around we saw the new RCM Lima location and looked at few cars. We eventually found a minivan that we loved, a loaded 2010 Chrysler Town & Country. Took it out twice on test drive. Also took out a Volkswagen Routan. Loved bought minivans but the payments were higher than I could afford, especially considering I was upside and backwards on the old Mazda. With each test drive, Matt asked thoughtful questions to see what else he could get for us and how he could help more. I joked "find me a loan and I buy anything except my piece of junk." Unfortunately, we didn't get the minivans. But with a lot of sweat and effort, Matt & his team found deal that would let me ditch the old junk and get into a safer vehicle at a good price. So last week me and my family picked up our 2010 Nissan Rogue AWD. Low miles. Clean. Doesn't feel used. I drive over bumps and barely notice. The other car, I'd be worried about something vital coming off. Other places put lots of pressure to buy road hazards or totally leave you cold. The only thing I kick myself for is not going to Rose City sooner. You see the commercials and get cynical. I did. But Matt & his team are top notch. You do business with them, you'll be treated right. I'm glad I did.]
