[108436376006448596477,100466422381424583419,I randomly went to this place a few months ago just driving by and have been back close to ten times since. Great food with the Buffalo favorites and a variety of other options you can't get elsewhere. The beer selection is solid too. Specifically wanted to write this review for the fish fry though - its fresh and well prepared. Went with my family last week and everyone couldn't stop talking about the fish fry.]
