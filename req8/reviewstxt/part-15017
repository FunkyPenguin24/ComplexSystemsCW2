[101574029464154883965,100967976735513889664,The best coffee place anywhere near Fairfax. They exclusively serve coffee from PT's Coffee and have high enough turnover that they order fresh beans every single week. They are masters of the pourover and their espresso-based drinks are excellent as well. On top of it all, the owner, Amir, is the kind of person you want to give business to, no matter what the product. Passionate, knowledgable and friendly. But even if he was unpleasant I would be coming back again and again for the coffee. I don't judge coffee shops on pastries (which are incredible here!), open mic nights, ambiance, wifi (which is also great), or anything else. I only judge it by its coffee and this place is top notch.]
