[110694509594385998613,100852671578255946198,A great restaurant. Faithful customer of over 10 years. Best time to buy chicken is during lunch and dinner hours. Not a place to eat. You would eat the menu standing before they seat you on a table. I buy to carry out and enjoy it on the outside. Try it once, what do you have to lose. Best thing would be that you won't come back, but you'll like it.]
