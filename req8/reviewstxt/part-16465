[110731531719115527381,101044852346512278988,We honesty haven't tried the food (yet), but the atmosphere was perfect; simple yet with style. The bartender (Don) was enthusiastic about working there, knew all the details and even gave us a tour of the distillery. As for the Moonshine, it is one of the smoothest I have ever had, and the whiskey... words can't describe it's excellent flavor. Now, if I can just talk the wife into letting me join the Barrel Club, life would be grand! Thanks Copper Run!]
