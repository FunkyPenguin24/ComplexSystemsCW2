[115972029984450278025,100667367029736050016,Joseph Hernandez was my dealer and he was very down-to-earth and easy to talk to. There was definitely lack of communication on warranty price, however. And this large increase in my price was not brought to my attention until I met with the financer (don't know his name). I felt that this was an attempt to sneak in a higher price. Not right. I still went on with the purchase and am happy with my car, but I would not recommend this dealership to anyone else because of this low move on their part. Buying a car is a big deal, Mike Erdman Nissan--try to make it a good experience for the customer. I hate that I'm not completely happy with this experience.]
