[111037957363204821609,100542956858309099621,I'm rather surprised to see the vitriolic reviews. I've been a patient Dr. Suddath since 2005 and have found him to be a very competent compassionate doctor. I agree with Pine Forrest, he is one of the best doctors I've had and the best psychiatrist. When I initially consulted him I had tried on my own to withdraw from antidepressant drugs with disastrous results. Dr. Suddath helped me find a medication regime that works for me and that gives me no side effects at all. He was the first doctor I'd ever seen that pushed for me to get my vitamin levels checked and it was this way that I discovered I had a vitamin b-12 deficiency and anemia. I would recommend him highly.]
