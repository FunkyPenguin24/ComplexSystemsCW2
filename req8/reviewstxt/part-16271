[110080008604813693197,101035190430028710601,Paul/NYC Dog Walkers are amazing! They leave daily notes, letting me know how everything went, and are really caring. My dog was still a puppy when we first signed up for walks, and they were always super patient and understanding with my accident-prone, energetic pup. We had an especially brutal winter and when my dog refused to walk/got too cold, they were kind enough to carry him part of the way or let him have some play-time with his fellow walking-mates. My doormen are always praising how friendly and on-time my walker is. It's also worth noting that Paul is very responsive to emails, so adding another walk in the evening for late-days at the office were typically not a problem. For their price, the quality is really great - highly recommend!]
