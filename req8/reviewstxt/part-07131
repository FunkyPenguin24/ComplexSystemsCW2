[108417479275555149180,100539497942729673669,We got a wonderful studio apartment with private bathroom for one night at a very low price. Location also was great. When we went to check out we met the owner and he offered us a free breakfast in the hostel. They do seem to care about their customers here. Would book again if stopping in Dublin another time.]
