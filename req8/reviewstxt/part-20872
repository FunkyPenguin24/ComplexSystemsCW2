[105948639721845649480,100106408766748063449,Over Spring Break I wanted to purchase my favorite vehicle a HONDA ACCORD. I went to Proctor Honda, and my husband and I were greeted by Harold the sales representative. Harold was GREAT! He worked extremely hard to ensure I could drive off the lot in the Honda I wanted. I promised Harold that if he took care of me I would return in 4 years to buy another Honda from him. My plan is to return in 4 years because of the friendly, kind, patient service I received from Harold. I love my new Honda Sport!!]
