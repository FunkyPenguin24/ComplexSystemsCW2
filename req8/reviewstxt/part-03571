[117592550755101171290,100344951079213330854,I went to this place last nite and i tell u the 1st thing is is very hard to find 2nd the food nearly killed me and the 3rd the prices were over the top for what u get. I ordered the Fajitia as a joined plate with my husband, i explained to the waitress that i am allergic to Capsicum, which she noted down and when our meal arrived i looked at it and was starting to eat when i noticed that the WHOLE meal was laced with Capsicum..... I spoke with the waitress and she was very shocked that i recieved it,[], after checking with the kitchen staff they thought only part of the meal was for me but it is a MEAL for 2!! I was so angry that i asked for the manager and i told him the story and he double checked with the kitchen staff and the computer thingy they use to make sure that the waitress wrote down the correct order WHICH she did may i add, he come back asking me what i wished to do and repeated that i wouldn't be paying for a meal that could kill me...... He couldn't do enough for me after that. As for the pricing that well when u look at the menu PAY attention to the Fajita's for 2 is double the price got figure that out but it is a shared meal so y pay for 1 meal twice???? Decor was fair, service slow at times but place was busy..... Neaver eating there AGAIN i am sorry.]
