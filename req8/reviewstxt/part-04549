[116187203113174170751,100401209926837412983,100% worth it. Gatorland has expanded, so if you were last there 15+ years ago (like me), you'll be pleasantly surprised at all the new stuff. Gators, snakes, birds, gators, goats, and more gators. Gatorland fits nicely into one casually-paced day. Take a break from Disney and enjoy Gatorland!]
