[111301761333313295945,100451444140087998584,I went to Dr. Lin with a toothache. He took an X-ray and thought that it might have been sinus pressure from an undiagnosed sinus infection. He prescribed a course of antibiotics. He said that he wanted to do a little "detective work" before he did any expensive dental work. My toothache cleared up almost immediately. Dr. Lin is quite a detective! I suspect that many dentists might have taken this opportunity to sell me a crown but Dr. Lin cured my problem very inexpensively. I highly recommend him.]
