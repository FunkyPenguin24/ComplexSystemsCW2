Sometimes it's is a bit greasy, but I'm not going to say that's a negative. The only thing I've ever not liked, surprisingly given what I just wrote, is their chicken wing pizza. Perhaps it was just a one time thing, but I thought the chicken had the consistency of sawdust. The whole table agreed, and trust me, we are not a family that throws away chicken wing anything. Service has never been bad. Definitely try it if you're here, at least as take out.]
