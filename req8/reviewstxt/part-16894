[114268839253151316015,101068740295612111290,I have been living in Aztec Springs for the past 16 months and would say this is one of the better complexes I have lived in. I love the fact that they have 3 pools, one of which is heated, so that the community pools aren't crowded or overfull giving people a more relaxed experience within them. The staff is very professional and responsive to any issues that arise, usually within 24 hours of them being called in.]
