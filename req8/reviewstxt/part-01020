[100204565828007056141,100211929675602087934,Ok very basic hotel. Recently renovated with flat screen TVs and linens, but otherwise unremarkable. The gym in the basement is deplorable and the free breakfast is standard for La Quinta, essentially a wide assortment of carbs. Its a fairly tall building, 16 or so stories and does give great views of the city if your room faces it. Great if you happen to be there on 4th of July. Its a safe clean bed, not much better.]
