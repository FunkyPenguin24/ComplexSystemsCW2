[106949699974874806770,100842016848799045502,The 22nd annual Burnham Donkey Derby was held in Burnham Park on Saturday the 25th of May 2013 and attended by about 4,000 people. Organised by the Rotary Club of Burnham Beeches, the event featured a host of stalls, funfair rides and games to keep everyone entertained, with proceeds from the day donated to a host of charities including Marie Curie Cancer Care and the Alexander Devine Children's Hospice Service. JoAnne Good & Anna Webb aka the Barking Blondes opened our special day this year and the centrepiece of the afternoon's activities was a special arena where a range of donkey races took place while members of the public took a punt on who would win. The animals were kept busy throughout the day as children queued up for donkey rides, while a falconry show by Xtreme Falconry and Bollywood dancing from the Dancing Nikita Company provided entertainment between races. The Rotary Club of Burnham Beeches and all our stallholders would like to thank all the members of the public that came out to enjoy the Burnham Donkey Derby! We hope to see you again in 2014!ï»¿]
