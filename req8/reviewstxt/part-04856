[117518538397076564601,100416301674234109514,I am a realtor and often I need to get quotes on my listings to help sell the listings to qualified buyers. Every time I call Keir Jones office, they act immediately to get me the info I need to help me sell my listings. On the flip side, if I have the buyer, I always send them to Keir Jones office. Most recently, I sent him two buyers. One was a lease and the buyer bought renters insurance. The other was a buyer who bought a condo in downtown Long Beach. Both were very satisfied with Keir Jones office. Finally, I personally have switched my business from another office to Keir Jones. What I like is that he keeps me in the forefront of my needs. When I switched my policies to his office. He reviewed my policies and suggested upgrades. And it just so happened this was something I had asked to be done before and was not done. One final note, Keir Jones is involved with our community. He is involved in our community. I like that! His staff is very friendly and quick in answering any questions I may have regarding my clients or my own needs when it comes to insurance. Good job!]
