[109922475088484123984,100751493880610726090,A great dentist, period. Not just professional but careful, even meticulous, taking all the time any procedure requires to achieve not just functionality but excellence. Willing to engage in dialogue and explain options to reach the best solution for the issue in hand, and my teeth have had plenty of issues to discuss, all of them dating back to long before I found Dr. Chan and some of them due to previous dentists, none of them bad, but none of them as good as Dr. Chan. Completely up to date in methods of treatment. Refers to other dentists for some procedures if the result would be better for the patient. I recommend her wholeheartedly to anyone.]
