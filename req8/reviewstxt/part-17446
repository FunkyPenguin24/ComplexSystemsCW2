[114757222795726773875,101100528063496968827,This is one of the prettiest caravan parks I've seen. It's super-spacious - most parks pack everyone in - here everything was far apart - we could not hear anyone, and could see few. It has a pool, tennis court, trampoline & playground. Clean showers and toilets. It is rustic and not at all glossy, but comfortable.]
