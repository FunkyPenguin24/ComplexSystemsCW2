[103680971751364888531,100208580559762128248,I bought my first new car since 1977 from Primeaux. I have always driven used cars but due to the miles I was driving I decided I needed a new car with a big warranty. I have had all my service done at the dealer ship since buying this Sorento 48,000 miles ago. My experience has always been excellent! They have always treated me like they value my business and want to make sure that I come back to buy from them again. I have bought more than my share of cars in my 55 years and I can truly say that Primeaux has treated me the way I would treat my customer. I am happy that I did business with them and when the time comes I wouldn't hesitate to buy again from them. In fact, I have sent two friends there and they bought cars from them and are equally happy with the level of care and service they have received.]
