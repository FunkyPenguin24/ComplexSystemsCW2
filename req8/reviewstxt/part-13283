[105226409933034417849,100873378795349286897,Awesome bike tour. Three of us went on the 9:45 am bike tour on a Sunday. Took about three hours. Not too strenuous, but at the same time, I felt we covered plenty of ground too. The guide Teddy was great, the bikes were great, and the whole experience was great. This bike tour was the perfect way to explore New Orleans and soak in many of the sights. I highly recommend this bike tour to anyone visiting New Orleans.]
