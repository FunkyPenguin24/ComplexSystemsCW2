[111431098218367577125,100618784171181621911,Come here if you wanna eat the original pizza from Napoli. I'm from Napoli and I must admit that the pizza I ate here is possibly better than so many pizza you can eat in Naples itself. If I'm not wrong the owner of this pizzeria is from Salerno, near Napoli. The charcoal oven gives this pizza an incredible taste and consistency. I ate here in April 2008.]
