[105011914823186732614,100136758005655524885,Outside: the hotel exterior doesn't look very nice. Parking is easy. The hotel surroundings look nice. some mountains, forests and right in front of the hotel is a lake. (NOT to swim!) Rooms: We stayed in room 47, 44 and 43 which looked very nice. Room 47 and I believe 44 have a very nice view of the mountains and lake with a nice terrace. Both the room and bathroom were very clean. The interior appears to be updated quite recently. Don't know how the other rooms are. Restaurant: the food was good. When we mentioned that we were not able to attend breakfast on Sunday (which starts at 08:00!) the women behind the reception created a bag for the 3 of us with bread, fruit, drinks that we could take with us (no charge). These bags were all in our rooms when we returned from dinner. This is the kind of service that makes a hotel special. I would return. Room Tip: Not sure if all rooms have been updated. The rooms with a balcony looked very nice.]
