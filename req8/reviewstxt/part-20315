[101227838373505418293,100076885037855765521,My wife and I were in Pigeon Forge for our anniversary, and right before making it in to our hotel we broke down. They showed up pretty quick, specially considering the heavy traffic at the time. The driver was friendly the whole way back to the shop, and so were the people at the office. They helped the wait go by much faster, by talking and being friendly. Considering they had to drive 3 hours to find our replacement part on Saturday, the bill was even pretty reasonable, and they even have rental cars if you still need to get around while they fix you up. They were also strait forward and honest about what they were doing on our vehicle, and didn't try to get us parts/service we didn't need. If we ever have car trouble in Pigeon Forge again, we know where to go. I wish more shops were like this!]
