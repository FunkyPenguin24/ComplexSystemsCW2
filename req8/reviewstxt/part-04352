[105435634177916901554,100389795872788886562,Trunk Club completely changed the way I shop for clothes. My Stylist picks out outfits for me, send them to me to try on, an I only keep/pay the ones I like. Shipping is free both ways, and they don't charge you until you return the rejects. I am able to review each trunk online so the quality of the selections in the next trunk are more tailored to my style and fit. On occasion I will visit Trunk Club in person and try on outfits right there. These sessions really help my stylist hone in on my style. Oh and they provide free beer! I haven't bought cloths anywhere else for several years. The service is so convenient, saves time, and I have never looked better. Very highly recommended,]
