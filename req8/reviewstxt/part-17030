[113797850499159144488,101077426848280605938,Went there for the first time, last Sunday. My girlfriend and I entered, just to taste some Pastries. We ended up having a whole meal!! Great decor, ambiance, vibe, food, staff, price, taste. Everything par excellence. The Cheese French Fries and the Mexican Crepes were lip-smacking. In Dessert, we ordered a Blueberry Cheese Cake, Double Decker Brownie, a Pineapple something and a Mango something. (Sorry, don't remember their names), they were all Brilliant. I also wanted to buy a cake for my Father's birthday. Terry was very helpful in getting me a last minute order for a Dutch Truffle Cake. They organized everything and called me back within 3 hours for pickup. Good job, everyone. :) Definitely, a place worth visiting many many times. Thank you guys. :)]
