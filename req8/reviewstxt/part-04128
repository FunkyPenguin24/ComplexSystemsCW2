[107272438451772541826,100377132093386225260,I'm a member and I'm generally happy with most of the things and just ignore other small stuff. I would recomend it to you, only if you never plan to visit this gym during peak hours, you don't want to pay much and you can close your eyes at some things. Pros: spacious, lots of equipment, easy parking, indoor pool, cheap. Cons: crowded during peak hours, posers, leaving towels on the floor is OK for many in this gym for some reason.]
