[105859301997392233774,101146099824055885110,I knew which car I needed, and the salesperson (Pat) who helped made it seem very casual and stress-free. I was able to give a 2012 Black Subaru Legacy a test drive and really liked it. The car was well maintained. As far as the service goes, Pat really understand what I was looking for and didn't put any pressure towards making the purchase. He also said I could finance on the spot through BECU which saved me the hassle of having to go to BECU and then come back to the dealership to receive favorable financing rates. The way it worked was: I got whatever rate was quoted on the spot, but being a BECU member automatically lowered it to the rate they could give me. I even went back to BECU to check on this and I did get the lowest percent quoted. The car was thoroughly cleaned right before I took it out of the dealership, and the gas tank was full. Great stuff and I'm very happy with my purchase so far!]
