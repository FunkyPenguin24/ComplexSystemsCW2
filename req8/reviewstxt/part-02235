We were immediately greeted in the most down to earth friendly manner at the door by several staff members. We were immediately taken in by the warm ambience and relaxed atmosphere of Chadra’s. We enjoyed the Saturday evening buffet. This is where words escape me. This has to easily be the most incredible spread of food I’ve ever seen and tasted. Salmon, lamb, salad, fruits hummus just to touch the surface. Additionally, during our meal the owner, Nehme, personally came to our table to welcome us to his “humble establishment.”. It was reminiscent of visit by Rick at Rick's Café Américain from Casablanca. From beginning to end, this was the best overall dining experience my wife and I have had. We gladly now count ourselves as regulars at Nehme’s Chadra Mezza and Grill.]
