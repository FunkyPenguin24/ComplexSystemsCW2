[108379518983446580156,100623507598811727957,I was a loyal customer for 2 years and made use of 3 of their locations - so the crappy Cost Cutter "experience" seems to be across the board. While some of the stylists are good at what they do, the majority suck at it. The good ones are good enough to keep you coming back but sooner or later you get enough of attitude and half-assed haircuts from the other ones to make you want to walk. Another reason I used to like Cost Cutters was the convenience. I could stop in, after work, and usually get in within 15 minutes or so. If they couldn't get me in a chair in 15 mins, I would leave and go to the next one down the road.Now, if you don't schedule an appt. you wait and you wait and you wait. I don't make reservations to eat fast food (I actually don't even eat it) and I'm not going to be scheduling appts with CC either. I'm done with that. It's clear that CC is another example of a franchise that does not understand that paying customers are what makes your company grow. I've thrown out my loyalty card and will try somewhere new, effective today. I'll see how other "stylists" enjoy getting my business and tips. And no Cost Cutters, I will not be contacting you on your website - you've wasted enough of my time. Also want to point out that CC puts a review of 5 stars up for themselves to average everything out. You guys are the worst... Flaming homosexual receptionist also made me sick to my stomach. Nice job on hiring quality people to represent your company Cost Cutters!]
