[100828989480302317533,100111876249230965704,Bought my first bike here. Wasn't sure what KIND of bike I wanted...I was in-between road/mountain/hybrid because I wanted to get around town, but also go on trails, but also wanted to ride fast. I decided with a road bike, planning to get a MTB in the future. They let me test ride the bike in Down Pouring Rain, which made the experience thrilling. The guys made me (A woman) feel very comfortable. They did suggest that I wait and order a taller frame to fit me better, but I was a bit impatient and wanted to ride right away. They didn't push their advice on me, but now I know, as a consumer and avid rider, that they know what they are doing. I should have waited a few more days to buy the right size, but now I have the lesson learned. They fit the smaller frame to me and suited me up in awesome gear, which has lasted 3 years, with regular use. My bike (JAMIS SATELLITE) is now with a smaller woman, but still in Tip-Top shape as she is now doing many tri-s.]
