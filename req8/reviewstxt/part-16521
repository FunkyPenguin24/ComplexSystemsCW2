[112764677871219792663,101047962459213790754,I'd been ordering delivery online from Galla's for over a year. I always had good food but never dealt with anyone directly. Today, there was a mistake with my $52.00 order. I called to tell them that my chef salad had only lettuce and cheese. Before we even talked about corrective actions (refund or a new salad) I was told TOLD by THE OWNER that he saw the chef make the salad and it was made correctly. (But that's not the deal breaker.) I explained to him that I too am looking at the salad in front of me with no meat and no other toppings. He went on to say he'd rather lose my business the correct the problem. I'm totally stunned and will NEVER EVER order from them again. And of course, I will be telling everyone I know about this. DON'T ORDER FROM GALLA'S... they just want your money and do not value their customers.]
