[105719542749935628704,100919644285524395301,They dont tell you what your services will cost .. please ask them very clearly or you will be left with an empty pocket .. I committed the big mistake of not asking .. The whole thing cost me a whooping $570 .. I was shocked but my mistake not to ask .. If the owner is watching this .. can you please make sure that you make it clear about your services before you give them .. and can you also tell how much a general 30k service costs and is there any way to avoid spending so much money .. I would have clearly refused the service if I was informed about this .. Finally I went to back and sorted this out with the Manager .. The Manager Mark Foster is very very helpful and he made sure that the Mistake in my service is corrected , I have 55 k of free Toyota care and I was charged by the mistake of an employee .. I got refunded for more and also got a free service .. I am very happy and would go back for further service .. Also I will give these guys a good review at qualcomm classifieds ..]
