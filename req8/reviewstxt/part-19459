[113600687394360880822,100030636739040622914,I had a great experience to purchase a CRV Honda 45 days ago for my daughter who now studies her master degree in CA. from Mr. Tain at Anderson Honda. Since I contacted Mr. Tain 4 months ago from New York, he has been so helpful to my daughter and me. Mr. Tain was knowledgeabe and treated us with all respect. Even now he still assists my daught who got her first car in her life. I highly recommend who likes to buy a car contacts with Mr. Tain at Anderson Honda.]
