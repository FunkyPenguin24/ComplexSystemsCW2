[104621312620797387776,100056455872782417172,Rosemary is amazing! There is no one else I would trust my two dogs with since both of them have significant behavioral issues and only an extremely experienced and savvy individual can handle these two. In Rosemary I have found the perfect person! Rosemary is a partner in Annie and Lily's ongoing training working with the dogs on a daily basis through their walks incorporating training techniques that Annie and Lily respond to. She knows and understands dogs completely and I am absolutely comfortable and assured when they are in her care. Rosemary is also an advocate for my dogs letting me know of any changes in their health, well-being or habits that may be an early signal to a potential problem which is invaluable. She has even researched a recent health problem that impacted Annie and was able to identify the cause before the vet did! It is obvious that Annie and Lily adore Rosemary and display their love for her everytime they see her. I cannot tell you how much it means to me that Rosemary cares for and about Annie and Lily and I cannot recomment Rosemary and K9 Nirvana Pet Care highly enough! If you want the best for your pet call this service!]
