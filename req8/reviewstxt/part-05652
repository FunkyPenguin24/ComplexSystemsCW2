[105624609549704152906,100458834841596523786,They got it right at this place. Customer service is excellent. Joseph and his staff are approachable, helpful, and knowledgeable. They carry great brands and have a great selection of gear in their store. The fitting studio is the best I have been to and the services they provide are comprehensive. Joseph went above and beyond on a frame warranty issue I had and then when I got hit on my bike, was extremely responsive in getting me a quote for the insurance company and helping me get my bike and I back on the road. This shop has everything you see lacking in many shops. Although I live over an hour from this place, I will gladly drive over to get what I need from them. I would drive even further if I had to.]
