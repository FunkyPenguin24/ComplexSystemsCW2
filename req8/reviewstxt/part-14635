[110464271905454284031,100946879137791640556,I had purchased many things there one of them being packaged Chourico sausage. It was absolutly terrible. I called asking if I could return the package and the Chef answered the phone after speaking with a young lady. He said "whats wrong with it?" I said "I simply did not like the taste". He said "well its packaged, sorry nothing we can do!" I said "really?? You do not stand behind your products?" I spent over $30 this weekend there, I wanted to simply return a $5 and change product that I found sub-par. They do not stand behind there products, I asked him this over and over again and he said "If its made here, we would be able to do something about it but its packaged so sorry". I repeated back that Venda does not stand behind all of their products several times and he said not if it packaged. He was very arrogant. He is so disconnected from the customer service aspect of the food business its not even funny. I would not reccommend this place whatsoever.]
