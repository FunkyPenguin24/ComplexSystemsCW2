[101620549535225700221,100733342251783505423,+my six year old loved this place ! the first time we went we stayed for five hours .He was sweaty the entire time from all the fun fun he was having .3 days later he was asking to go again . I liked that they had WIFI and great seating areas .I thought it would be the kind of place that you and a girl friend could hang out for coffee and just let the kids have a great time with out having to worry about where they were every second of the outing . We did find it expensive though ,and thought that family passes could make it more affordable for families to go more often .]
