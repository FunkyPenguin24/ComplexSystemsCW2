[100771319292248294237,100988202966638954817,After trying out a free intro class, I was hooked. The classes are fun, effective, and able to scale to anyone's ability.The coaches are awesome and give great instructions on the exercises and make sure you are working hard. It's the largest Crossfit Box in the city and offers a ton of different time options for classes and by ability level. Definitely would recommend to anyone looking to improve their fitness.]
