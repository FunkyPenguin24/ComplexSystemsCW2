[104099304493381782815,100370692014959938222,I love Lion Heart Kombucha! Just started brewing my own booch with a starter kit I bought from the brew shop in Portland. Canâ€™t wait to taste it! My favorite LHK is definitely the ginger fizz. With my first batch I'm going to try and double ferment and add fresh ginger! Wish me luck :) Thanks LHK!]
