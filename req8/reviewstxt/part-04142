[102043527610457546434,100378099453126390935,I usually have a sweet spot for their Saluki Special even though their service is generally sub par. Yesterday I called and ordered 1/3 Saluki and 2/3 All Meat after being assured by the girl on the phone that we could do that. My boyfriend doesn't "do vegetables". Upon getting it - it was ALL Saluki. He called them to explain their mistake (and granted, he could have been nicer about the mistake but you know how men get when they are hungry and he had a limited lunch window and didn't get to eat as a result). When the delivery driver arrived he asked me for the original pizza back (what!?) but since the Saluki was for me I had already eaten on it. I stood there a little mortified while he called his manager. I even tried to tip the driver (as it wasn't HIS fault that they made a mistake and they often have to use their own gas and rely on tips) he still continued to treat me like dirt. After getting the pizza inside.. the bottom was burnt black as coal. Coincidence? I doubt it. I will not be returning to mackie's of my own accord]
