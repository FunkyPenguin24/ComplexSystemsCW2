[106149865770063101044,100961289432657740496,I agree with the previous reviews in all aspect, the mean little man behind the counter was rude to his costumers as I was waiting to get service, when It was my turn he asked me how was the weather up there, I mean I'm 6.7 feet tall BUT that does NOT warrant such jokes, especially from a dwarf, last year (2011) I had a flat and well I needed the bike fixed right away. that was does only because I insisted and payed more than normal - the owners are abusing their mechanics- and they are really good except they're overworked and under-payed- and this year when I thought to bring the bike for a tune up, I was told to leave my bicycle for 5 days. So avoid this store and if you must go then arm yourself with resolve because you will be verbally abused.]
