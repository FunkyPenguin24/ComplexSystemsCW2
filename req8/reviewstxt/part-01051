[100313546751007665715,100213442888693066069,It's hard to sell the hamburger as healthy, but they make a valiant and sort of self righteous effort. The Food? It's Ok, I guess. About the same quality as 5 Guys but I like 5 Guys better, at least they know what they are selling! I thought the bun could be fresher and of higher quality. I didn't feel cheated, but I didn't feel healthier or over satisfied either!]
