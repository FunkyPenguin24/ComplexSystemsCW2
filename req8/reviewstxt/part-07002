[104813036816239308412,100532686303257042744,This is a very great place to grab a quick breakfast burrito. They have the best options in Pueblo. Their lunch is great, too. But they close @ 2:00pm so it limits you to a time range you might not be able to make. All in all it's a great place and worth the money.]
