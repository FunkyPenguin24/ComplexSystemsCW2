Hot Springs have green water and smell of sulfur. Not this place. Second, we tried to ho back after dark....Dont be fooled when they tell you its open till midnight. Thats a lie by disinformation. They cut admission at 10pm but make it sound like you can go anytime before midnight. The gate guy rejected us at 1030. We begged "please make an exception, we just drove 4 hours from denver, its my birthday"-all true. They guy wouldnt even look up or make eye contact. We wont return.]
