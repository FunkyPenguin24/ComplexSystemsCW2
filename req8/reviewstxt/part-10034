[108811696461308702907,100695146928089943352,I started going to Rockville Dental Arts recently and it has been a very pleasant experience. I had a big fear of dentistry after bad experiences with other dentists so I went in with considerable anxiety. But Dr. Barnes and the staff at the office are patient, respectful, and attentive. Appointments are efficient and easily scheduled. Though dentistry is expensive in general, Rockville Dental Arts is priced competitively and have not attempted to up-sell on unnecessary procedures. So far I have no reservations about recommending them to others.]
