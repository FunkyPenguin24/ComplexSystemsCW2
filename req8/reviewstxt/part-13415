[103664471634886870890,100880294798437923001,I had a real carpet "emergency" when our large dog got sick all over our brand new area rug less than 24 hours before a house full of company arrived. I called Right & Clean and Raphael was at my house within 15 minutes - this was at 7 p.m. on a Tuesday. He did a thorough job cleaning and treating the rug and charged me a fair price. It was worth every penny to have a clean, odor-free rug for my family and our company. I will use Right & Clean for all my rug and upholstery cleaning from now on.]
