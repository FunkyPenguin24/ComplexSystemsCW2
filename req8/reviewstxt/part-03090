[100995161822635727686,100319189373164685409,My favorite place to be for tailgating on game day. The parking on the inner lot is reserved in advance for the entire year, across the street is public but costly. Music is always great (typically a live band on game day), out door food booth is fast and decently priced considering what you pay inside the stadium.]
