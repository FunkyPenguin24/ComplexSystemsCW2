[117083450282650885131,100295289274367318572,Been a regular for a couple months, and I always had good results in the past (only when I'm not dealing with their manager). However, in a most recent service they ironed a ruffled shirt incorrectly: The way they did it left a lot of cleavage open. Unacceptable, since this is a business casual clothing item (which I explained). I politely brought this to their attention, but the manager yelled at me for not knowing that this IS the correct way to do it. Well, obviously not, since I bought the shirt in one way, (and brought it in looking the way I bought it but dirty) so it ought to look the way it does. I failed to see how apologizing for a mistake and doing a proper press to fix it is such a huge issue. No apologies were given. So rude that I left feeling very frustrated and angry. They did not want to fix it, but in the end did a half-assed job that completely ruined the pleats.]
