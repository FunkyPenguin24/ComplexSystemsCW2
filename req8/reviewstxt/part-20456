[101697187143482424204,100083975283918574843,We got a couple cheap, single rooms while we were in the city for two nights. Overall, the hotel was great for the price. Liked: Room 209 had comfortable beds, the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were really cheap. Disliked: The smell of cigarette smoke in the lobby (turns out this is because the first floor is the smoking floor). Other Thoughts: The Travelodge entrance is on the left side of the building when facing it from the road. I almost missed it since it was attached to the Super 8. Always call and ask about pet fees before booking.]
