[103961754040723852475,100990629766600538019,I was in a real jam when the screen on my laptop stopped working all of the sudden, and like any good Mac user I went straight to the local “genius” bar to see if I could get it fixed fast. They quoted me a 10 business day turnaround and $400 dollars to fix my computer! That seemed like a lot of money, but my real problem was TIME!!! I am a small business owner who depends on his computer every minute of every day just to keep the doors open! I was lucky to have a friend who recommended me to ITM computing. I thought surely they just work on PC’s but was delighted to find that they could totally fix my Mac. I made a quick trip down to their office to drop off my computer to see how they could help, they didn’t have the part in stock, but they ordered it for me and called me when it arrived a few days later. On my return trip down to their offices, they disassembled my laptop and fixed it in ONE BUSINESS HOUR!!! Plus they applied the previous diagnostic fee to the repair. Unlike the drones at the Apple Store, these guys understand the needs of small business. They had me up and running again in no time! The team at In The Moment Computing really impressed me, and I’m sure they’ll be the first people I call if my beloved mac ever runs into problems again.]
