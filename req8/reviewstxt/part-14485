[105134722658551019208,100939261272840995205,Driving back to Astoria last night around 8. It was the start of a storm so it was getting windy and wet. I hardly ever go to Starbucks because all I ever want is a regular coffee. But instead of going to Burger King my wife suggested Starbucks before we crossed the bridge back into Oregon. Went to the drive thru, asked for a double shot in the dark, drove around to the window. I asked the lady how to add cream and sugar (there was nothing at the window and wasn't sure how it was done there)? She said she would do it for me. Over the next hour on the drive home I savored some of the best coffee ever. Not sure the size of cup she put the double shots in, but it was rich and strong. Thank you whoever was working at that time last night.]
