[110344375195328862682,100897578649943578464,Karen saw that we were lost in the Dymocks building and introduced herself as a jeweller. In the end she gave us a fantastic deal for our wedding rings. The price she got us was extremely competitive and she blew us over with her in-depth knowledge. Karen is a lovely lady and very approachable. We greatly recommend her for anyone wanting to find that perfect ring]
