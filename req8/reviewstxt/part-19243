[105005396633455259341,100018734416618390447,Dr. Elzik is a fantastic Doctor, he understands and has an open mind yet he is not one of these Pain Clinics that are just in it for the money. My experience with Dr. Elzik is that he gets to the root of what is causing the pain and prescribing a whole program not just drugs to treat it. Marlene is fantastic to work with as well.]
