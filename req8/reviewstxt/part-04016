[113152671468794675579,100370380274728087922,The vacation rental we got on Ocean Front Walk was fantastic. Close to downtown so we got to visit the convention we were attending with relative ease, but right next to the beach so we could come home to the relaxing sound of waves every night. The last day we took advantage of the unexpected bikes to go to La Jolla and back, and then we relaxed at the beach right in front of the home. That evening we hung out on the patio as we got to see the sun set over the Pacific. Incredible. I would totally recommend renting from here--everything we in order when we arrived, no keys were necessary because there were number pads, internet worked fine, everything was clean, location was great. All the thumbs up.]
