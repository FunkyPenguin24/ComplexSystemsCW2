[110943512930221092454,100795034476514774783,The personal service is great, of course dealership is spendy fix, but i can swallow that for the service i get. the only thing that would really top it off if they did loaner cars for more then 4 hour fix or more (including you wait time) but the don't. Great guys, and they are even willing to share there work, Once i had something wrong with my car, the Mechanic that could fix that wasn't there that day, so they shared with me another place that was close by that could do the work just as good and quickly.. caring more about the customer and not the $ went a long way in my book. I was grateful for the info and things worked out great. Got the car fixed. Makes me want to go back again because i know they want to help me, not just take my money.]
