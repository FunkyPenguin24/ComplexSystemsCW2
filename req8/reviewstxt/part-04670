[104386340260414532546,100407678076756175259,I love Pure Orthodontics within 3 months of getting my braces my teeth were already looking alot better for my sisters wedding. Every time I go to either office all of the staff are always very friendly (Everyone is always smiling). I never see that anywhere else I go to. Dr Hussain is not like your regular doctor or dentist he is very cool and chill. Dr Hussain has always given me very good advise. Thx for the $Million Smile.]
