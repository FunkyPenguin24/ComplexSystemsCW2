[115553916670505379904,100700977219384447725,I was out of the hobby for a long time thanks to unfriendly hobby shops. I went into Maj's for the first time over 3 years ago and was instantly welcomed as a friend. Always helpful and friendly, never makes you feel like you are an idiot like some other shops in the area. Miniz racing is always fun! Flying helis and planes is a blast. Maj is ALWAYS there to help, if he doesn't have what you need you'll get it in a couple of days. I only shop at Maj's now.]
