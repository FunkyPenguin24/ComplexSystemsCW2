[117151933168173853484,100773977031901549788,I love the beds and pillows....NOT the blankets. Tiny, gross, dusty room. Tiny bathroom door doesn't lock. Small TV. Limited wifi usage (about 3 minutes). Horrible stay. Loud people. Everything was FILTHY. Never going here again. Do NOT go here if you want a good or an average hotel. Even my small dog did not like this. Terrible. Absolutely HORRIBLE.]
