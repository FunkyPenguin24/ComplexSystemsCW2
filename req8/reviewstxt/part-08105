[104076985931897436530,100593362374449560822,Unlike a couple other GBK locations in London the GBK in Putney seems slightly run down and cramped for space, however once you are greeted and welcomed by a member of staff the overall experience is a pleasant one. The staff friendly and the food has always been really good. If you are not in the mood for a traditional burger then I can highly recommend the falafel burger which is exceptionally tasty. The only negative for me, although I am probably being a little pedantic, is that the plastic tomato sauce(ketchup) bottles on the table always feel greasy and could really do with being cleaned once in a while.]
