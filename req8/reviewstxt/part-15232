[101922085773333935545,100978747858503257661,My experience at Leith Honda in Raleigh was wonderful! I was able to peruse the vehicles and communicate with a sales associate when I was ready. Waleed Abdelsattar assisted me with my purchase. He was attentive and made the extra effort to ask me not only what type of car I wanted but what kind of purchasing experience I would like. For instance, he wanted to know how much information and communication I wanted/needed from him. He listened when I explained why I was looking for the type of vehicle I had my heart set and helped me make my own decision. Additionally, I was impressed that Waleed did not pressure me to hurry and make a purchase so he could make a sale. In past car purchasing experiences, I felt the need to have my father or brothers accompany me so I would not be hassled or misled as many car dealerships tend to mislead women. Waleed provided me with excellent information and even encouraged me to compare his information elsewhere. As a result, I was neither hassled or misled and feel great about my decision and purchase. I greatly appreciate Waleed's attention and customer care.]
