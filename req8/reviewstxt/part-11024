[116622189838364138011,100749080021119005995,WAAAAYYYYY OVERPRICED!!!!! Being from New Jersey, I'm used to paying high prices for everything. But even NJ isn't this bad! $3.25 to substitute whole wheat capellini for white capellini. And when I asked for a side of marinara (for bland dish), I received a side of pizza sauce that had no seasoning of any sort. Again, $3.25 (no price listed on menu.) My dish with "seasonal" vegetables turned out to be mushrooms, a little spinach, a few green peppers & a little broccoli. Being the end of summer, I envisioned "seasonal" as something quite different. Maybe the "seasonal" vegetables in NJ are different than Maryland. Wait staff, etc. are friendly but no one seems to really care if you like your food or not. One would think the waitress might ask why I left half a plate of food, didn't want to take the leftovers (especially at these prices) & felt the need to add "marinara" sauce & lots of parmesan cheese to a dish that didn't contain either. How do they get away with this????]
