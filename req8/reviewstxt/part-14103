[114474098199528514734,100917287724172157505,I brought my car in and told them "I have a TRASNMISSION problem. They said it will cost $130 for a diagnosis of the problem. Get a call back later and said it's your transmission we are going to need to charge you $250 for a diagnosis. Uhm, read the paperwork IT SAID TRANSMISSION issue. You knew good and well what it was when I told you and you ripped me off. Plus you quoted me worst case scenario $4,200 for a replacement and I have received quotes for $1,600 for the same thing. Really consider wasting your money here. Total rip off!]
