[112169140682379158945,100469417324060000136,Scott Magnuson, a Coulter Cadillac staff member, alerted the sales team on my behalf about the fact that I was looking for a car and the basic terms I was looking for in a deal. I had pre-approved financing through USAA and it was my goal to get a car out the door for less than my bank said it was worth, which would allow me to fiance the car 100% with no money down. A trade-in came in over a subsequent weekend that was a perfect match, and Bill Jurczak gave me a call. So confident was I in Scott's recommendation of me to Bill, and Bill's efforts in finding a perfect deal, that I basically bought the car sight unseen, went in the next day to finalize everything, and drove out one happy camper. By the end of the day, 110 of my Facebook friends agreed, I got a fantastic deal on a dependable used car, worth more than I paid for it. Yay for me! Hip Hip Hoorary for Bill, Scott and the Coulter Cadillac gang!]
