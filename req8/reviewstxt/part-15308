[110297884493553653115,100982995791209268756,Before our first visit, we let Cam know our out-of-pocket limit, trade-in (excellent condition), and what we had in mind for a used vehicle purchase. We made it a point to be very clear about what we were looking to purchase, but kept getting the response, "oh you'll never find anything like that (in your price range)." Cam was not an easy person to talk to over the phone because constantly interrupting, trying to talk over you. Thankfully, on the day of our appointment, Cam was running late for our appointment- no big deal- we were happy to work with Tyler. Tyler was very kind, very patient and actually took time to listen to us... and then around the corner came good old Cam in a vehicle for us to test-drive that was $10,000 over our price range! Please, Cam, you have to learn to listen.As it turned out, no vehicles on their lot were in our price range, and we of course cannot hold that against Hendrick's. A dealership can't possibly carry enough vehicles to please every customer. A great option they provide (for $1/mile) is to have vehicles shipped in from their other dealerships around the country. Tyler and Rod did their best to help us find such a vehicle. We really appreciated their patience. While searching on their computer system for other vehicles around the country within our price range, they also calculated a value for our vehicle as a trade-in. Hendrick's offered only $5500 for it, whereas Kelley Blue Book put our vehicle trade-in value at $7900.We put our vehicle on craigslist at the Kelley Blue Book private sale value of $9,000, and sold it last week for $8,500. We then bought a 2005 Toyota Sienna LE with 77,000 miles (excellent condition) for $10,900 - and NO, we absolutely did NOT buy it at Hendrick's Toyota in Merriam. Before you consider coming to Hendrick's with a trade-in, I encourage you to consider selling your vehicle on your own so you can get a fair deal (craigslist). That is what we did, and I know we saved AT LEAST $5,000. I can think of a lot of ways to spend $5,000 on my wife and children. Sorry, Ms. Cam, none of that $5,000 went toward your commission. I still don't understand why you never even attempted to put us in a vehicle that was within our budget. You have to learn to listen, young lady.]
