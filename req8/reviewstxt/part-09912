[108906043267609120979,100688622014222748551,I live in the next town in Winnsboro and Classic Lanes is defiantly the place to go for a fun date night or a girls night out. I love the whole place, from the fun arcade and pool table in the back to the laser tag and bowling in the front! The food and drinks are good prices. Also there is a smoking room for adults while your kids play.]
