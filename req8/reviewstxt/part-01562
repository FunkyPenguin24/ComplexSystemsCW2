[114981328598954536698,100239236916883748965,If being treated like a number is your thing, then this is the place for you. There are several employees who have zero customer service skills. Sure, it is possible to have a visit that is pleasant, but tangling with any of the "god's gift" employees is a day killer. This has been my vet for over a decade and I am done. Beautiful facility, but should have invested in sharper employees.]
