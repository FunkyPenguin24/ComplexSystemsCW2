[107766514550139259110,101161260582982379757,UPDATE - El Mexico continues to be THE BEST family run Mexican restaurant in Wichita. I really like a good fried taco, and theirs are not greasy at all. I especially go for the chicken tacos, and they spice the meat just right. Open one up, put a big glop of guacamole and salsa inside, fold and enjoy! YUM!]
