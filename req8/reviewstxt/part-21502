[101995811532413241180,100139992808146866774,Hey Bruce, why did you even have to write a review!! You got your product back and an explanation. The dealings I had with Louisville Geek have been more than positive. When one tech couldn't figure it out another tech got on my computer without even coming in to solve the problem. Sometimes I feel people who like to complain, complain about EVERYTHING! I GIVE YOU ONE STAR on ratings.]
