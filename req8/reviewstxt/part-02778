[108073719596310660221,100301949390429348498,CJ is my lady! She is the only I see at this salon and she is phenominal. I always get compliments on my cuts from her. In addition to being incredibly talented, she's an authentic and entertaining person that's fun to talk to. Her style is definitely more on the edgy side, but she's helped me step into some really bold changes with my look! She was the first person I went to when I donated 14 inches of my hair to Locks of Love and since then I've been feeling more and more comfortable with shorter and sexier hair. Thank you CJ!]
