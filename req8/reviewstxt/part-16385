[114675737608162361041,101041475469284337908,Just got back from 1 week at Kahana Falls and we had a amazing experience. While I am sure all rooms are not equal, ours was great. We had a studio condo unit. Full kitchen, fold down bed, porch with pool view on the second floor. Obviously this is not a 5 start hotel. However for the price we paid, we really couldn't be any happier. Be sure to ask details about the room you are reserving. I say this because there was a room next to ours which I am pretty sure did not have any outer facing windows. It had windows looking into the stairwell area, but I don't think it had any looking outside, or a porch.]
