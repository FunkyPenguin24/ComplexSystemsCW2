[118235310950553203734,100833720257806987785,Outstanding experience! As my wife and I walked up, there was a nice lady making fresh tortillas near the entrance. We were seated and promptly brought warm fresh tortillas, salsa and our drinks. I had enchiladas and my wife had the seafood fajitas. Both of us really enjoyed our meals! Tony (our server) was awesome and kept our drinks full and kept bringing us freshly made tortillas. We will definitely be back again! Only bad thing could be parking, but that is common in that part of town.]
