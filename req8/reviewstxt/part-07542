[102508819744710350152,100562911375838543320,This place is a joke...don't waste your money! We booked a dove hunt here with James who told us that they were doing all sorts of plowing, planting, and digging new ponds, and that there were seeing more dove than ever. He even took the liberty of sending me photos of the property with birds flying everywhere that, looking back, I think were probably photoshopped. When we arrived the only thing we found were fields of dirt, no crops, and no ponds to speak of. There were no dove, and no other wildlife that we could see anywhere around. James completely misrepresented what he has to offer and will not be getting our business for any of our hunts in the future.]
