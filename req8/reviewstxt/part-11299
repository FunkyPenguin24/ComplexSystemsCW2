[103515803010810629208,100763552330321385504,This place has good food, but if you have kids dont waste your money on the kids meal. My kids got the quesadilla meals, and they were $4. They came with a very small cup of rice, a drink, and a "quesadilla" so small it could fit in my hand. My kids left this place hungry. If you have kids, send them to Barros next door before you eat at Cafe Rio.]
