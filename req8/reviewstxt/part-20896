[117039491025734812313,100107669330713456526,Great Italian food for a good price. My roommate came across it while walking around our neighborhood looking for something to eat. I love their spaghetti (especially their Jumbalaya) because their sauce is actually a little spicy and has real tomatoes, herbs and spices in it (it's not too sweet like some Taiwanese-Italian food out there). I was very impressed with this place overall and continue to bring people to it. I hope it keeps up their dishes and doesn't change anything.]
