[107408145391768725697,101000947475143958611,I love the free internet, and the atmosphere. It is conducive to getting online work done while relaxed. I had a breakfast burrito, which was delicious! (And they are not stingy with the filling!) I have iced coffee every visit, and it is always delicious! As far as internet goes, it is fast and reliable, and it is nice to sit at the bar while online, watching the traffic go by.]
