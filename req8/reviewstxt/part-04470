[111234054119564524027,100396189172812098732,I had a great experience at The Foundry, the staff were great and were around 24/7 if you needed them. Probably aimed more towards the mature students as the place can be very quiet (which was a godsend during the exam period) Do be warned that some things can come at an extra one-off cost (i.e £50 cost to connect a games console to the network, £30 for wifi) Other than that though the place was awesome, I had a good fresher year there. Having the staff living there and being in the center of town made it well worth the money. I'll seriously consider coming back in later years]
