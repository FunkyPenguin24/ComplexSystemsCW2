[105581875045160635791,100629249358721236673,I LOVE Juno Salon! Brooke Cady does my eyelash extensions. I have worn strip lashes for a couple of years and thought I would try this new trend, Lash extensions! I love them! Brooke individually glues lashes to your own lashes. Jack loves the look and the cost is comparable to buying lashes/glue/mascara. This salon has a great atmosphere. I probably shouldn't say so, but as I waited for Brooke last week, I overheard negotiation between the owner and the Denver Nuggets Cheerleader Representative... looks like I am in good company choosing Juno Salon.]
