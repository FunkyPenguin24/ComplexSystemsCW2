[117648355389758821097,100233423648864804158,Alright atmosphere, but the paper tablecloths really detract from it. Restaurant was moderately busy but there seemed to be plenty of waiters. Service was bad. Took forever, the waiter didn't write anything down and consequently forgot things, didn't give us silverware, and never checked up on us. Food is expensive for what you get. Portions are good, but food is on the bland side. The waiter recommended Brazilian brand Skol beer to me. It was $5, came in a can, tasted like Budweiser, and I didn't even get a glass for it. Not recommended and we won't return. There are better choices in St. Louis at this price point.]
