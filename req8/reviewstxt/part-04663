[113710845438636972928,100407311998468227477,What do want to know. Why don't you just leave me alone. Can't hardly get by today without some imaginary life device. So for peace and easy going conscience I get one, and try to continue to live and grow. But apparently the earth is too small for whoever you leaders and teachers are. ..I used to be able to get food off a tree, easily attainable free or little cost to fill needs....now the only thing I can get for free is a device so I can keep...what, reading or writing a review. You wanna know about ulvn? Go see it. Its in a nicer ghetto than usc. !]
