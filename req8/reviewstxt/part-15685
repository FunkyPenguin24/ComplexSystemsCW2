[102672490733220731935,101003858630727382491,Thank You Larry Simmons, you made a first time buyers experience comfortable and unintimidating. You made my year long car search all worth it. If I had to describe my experience I would have to use a simile, buying my car from you vs. buying my car from another dealership is like staying at a Four Seasons vs. staying at a Holiday in. They really knew how to make me comfortable with the whole experience, from allowing me to test drive the car without the annoying car salesman talking my ear off in the back sea,t to negotiating the price of the car without an intimidating pushy salesman. Larry laid out straight forward what he could do and what he couldn't. The only negative was that since it was a high demand car they could not move on their advertised price (which was fair in the first place) however, he did move up a great deal in what they would give me for my trade in. Also thank you to the finance guy ( I'm sorry I don't remember your name) you were very informative when presenting me with my warranty and insurance options and you took "no" for an answer the first time without using the "scare tactics" that many finance guys would have responded with. If I planned on buying another car in the near future I would definitely work with this team again and I would recommend them to anyone who is looking to purchase a new/used vehicle.
