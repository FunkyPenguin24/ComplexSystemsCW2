[101219850703722303427,100729346525564789123,I give it 3 stars, because the food was just what I wanted as far as a greasy spoon restaurant goes. However, i seem to have a different opinion of the staff and atmosphere. The staff was rude, ignored my son and I. I practically had to get my own set up. There was an older man that brought us a highchair and crackers, since after 10 minutes the waitress didn't feel the need to even give us a menu. She was more interested in the men that seem to frequent the place. The cashier didn't even say hi, or how was everything. She carried on a conversation with another patron and then wasn't going to have me sign my credit card slip. So, I asked for it and she said "not unless you want to leave a tip" Uhh yes. I think your restaurant sucks, but I'm not a douche. Anyways. Never going back.]
