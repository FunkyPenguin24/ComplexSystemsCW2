[100249767247315613890,100586066756674920258,I had stomach cramps and went to my doctor for a full checkup. He did a full set of lab tests and a full exam. He thought there was a slight chance I might have appendicitis and told me he had talked to McKenzie Willamette to schedule a ct scan and to check in at the emergency room desk. Following his instructions, I went to the hospital to have a ct scan of my abdomen. They insisted I wait in a bed in the hospital, redid all of the lab tests my doctor had done, had me checked by an physician's assistant, and finally did the cat scan 3 hours later. Everything came back negative and they sent me home. I received a bill from the hospital for $7930.02, charging me for 2 ct scans at $2352 each, $2244.94 for a comprenhensive er visit, multiple charges for medication and lab results. In addition, I've received bills for about $400 from the radiologist and the emergency room physician. Bottom line is the total bill was almost $9000.00 for one test to rule out a slight chance of appendicitis. I've been disputing the bill since I received it in early July and to date, haven't been able to get it resolved. I've checked with the business manager 3 times, sent a long letter, and have still not heard anything back. THIS IS TOTALLY OUTRAGEOUS AND AN ABUSE OF THE MEDICAL SYSTEM. My insurance has paid approximately $3200 of this bill and disallowed $4045. The hospital is still trying to collect $1237.94 from me and each of the doctors wants his piece of the pie also. Any call to them regarding the dispute results in "the doctor (or his assistant) performed the exam whether it was requested, needed or not, and I have to pay the bill. My husband had a severe heart problem 2 years ago and was taken to Riverbend Sacred Heart Hospital, spent several hours in the emergency room with extensive tests, was admitted overnight and his bill was less than this bill for a simple ct scan. We all have choices of the hospital we use - DON'T GO TO MCKENZIE WILLAMETTE! They are a total rip off and are padding their bills.]
