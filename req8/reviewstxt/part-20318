[107646190322455014551,100076962904158073487,Great customer service. Went here to open a storage unit for work yesterday, they were super friendly, and made sure to go over everything I needed to know. I had my dog with me, and they were not only ok with her being there (Service dog, but she didn't have her cred's with her) but were super sweet with her and let her check the unit out with me. I appreciated that a ton. Edwin (Manager) and Cathy were super informative, and I am glad I chose this location to store our things.]
