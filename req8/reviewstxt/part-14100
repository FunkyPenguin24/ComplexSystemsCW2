The restaurant has a wide variety so you cannot fail to satisfy your taste buds, even for the picky ones. The staff are friendly and helpful, always looking for new ways to be of assistance. An adjacent golf course makes a whole world of difference and even without a personal kit one can still rent equipment and balls at a modest fee. It is the first hotel in the 16 I stayed at in 2012 where internet vouchers are given on demand free of charge. I cannot forget to talk about the shuttle to town, as a free service to the guests, which I used once in the two week period of my stay. You can take shuttle, do some shopping and other activities in town and take a shuttle back.]
