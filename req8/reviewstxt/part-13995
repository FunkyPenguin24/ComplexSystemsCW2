[108443495766118692139,100910993638633642391,Just went to this place for the first time today. A Sunday at 11:30, the place was busy. I waited about 10 minutes for a table, which was less than I expected. The foyer has great family diner appeal, being papered with dozens of colored "Egg and Us" coloring book pages which had been colored in by kids. There were a lot of families with young kids there, but the crayons in a mug on every table kept them occupied and quiet. There was a great atmosphere in the place. Waitstaff was friendly and prompt. Our food took a while to arrive, but not overly long for how busy it was. I ordered the "Migas" scramble, which was quite tasty. The hash browns served with it tasted much better than they looked. The portion was generous and I was able to make a second meal of it later. Throughout the meal we were attended to frequently and courteously. The waitresses were really nice and I was never for want of anything. My only complaints are that my food was warm, but not hot. I think it was sitting for a while before it came to the table, but it was very edible and I liked it a lot despite that. Also, the glass my mimosa came in was dirty, and the drink itself was pretty pricey. My husband ordered a non-alchoholic drink, but still the cost of our drinks combined made up almost 1/3 of our total bill...yikes! They did offer free refills on the Arnold Palmer, but it seemed watered down. Overall, I had a pleasant experience there and will go again to try some of their sweet breakfast foods like pancakes or waffles. I'll stick to water though, as it's not the most budget friendly place. Definitely a great alternative to Denny's or IHOP for this style of food. Grade: B+ would recommend to people who enjoy breakfast foods in a casual setting.]
