[111213581084745964944,100833020747646292881,Selena, Laura and Brittnae to all of you my greatest sympathy for the conditions and the lies you have to tell under the tutlage of Tom Menard and Kelly. Whoever Jeff is it must be hard to take anything he says as truth unless he is a more of a jerk than it appears. I and several other clients have gotten fed up. Kelly is not what she seems to be she talks about her employees when they are not around, wonder what she says about the clients and she does that also. Report it to Tom and he says she should do that but she is still there so you can't take him serious at all. Even more when you confront Kelly she hides her head as if she can't talk. I have now had to tell her I rather talk to the other employees and as for service this year. Because Mother Nature stopped them for giving the best site maintenance,I've decide to ask how can I be compensated for having to shovel my own unit door front after the plowing crew has piled the snow up on the units. 4 times and Tom says there's nothing they can do. My door has been off track since 8/2/2013 I have personally told Tom this several times, what a joke it's still off track. I gave Laura a key today with implicit instruction that my trust level in Kelly is none. There are some videos I am posting soon to show even on days like March 2nd, 2014 temperature 40+ degrees and once again I had to shovel/ and or remove my own snow. My experience lately is shoddy management. Unprofessional behavior by the site manager and what a joke from the senior management and district manager. I WOULD SAY TAKE A LOOK AT THE OTHER FACILITY IN LANSING AS LONG AS KELLY IS MANAGER AND TOM AND /OR JEFF ARE SENIOR MANAGER. OH yeah and cooperate will forward you to Jeff's personal line which he must never answer if you call to speak to someone besides this management team.]
