[107990529221640079717,101004631293278862962,5 years ago, while I lived with an old Mercedes as a daily driver, my specialized mechanic retired on me and I had to find a new mechanic for this, and my "regular" car. A friend recommended a mechanic at Havertown Tire, so I gave them a try. They are open on Saturdays and that was a big help. Since this first meeting, I have taken my subsequent 5 cars to them, all foreign makes, and they have provided prompt, courteous and professional service to me. Russ and Tim have made me feel welcomed and a valuable customer and have gone out of their way to make sure my cars are maintained in good condition. Even my current car, that is under warranty goes to them for all my regular maintenance. They have done a variety of work that I have been very happy with. From regular oil changes, annual inspections, to brake discs and pads, fluid changes, shocks and struts, to more involved engine work and diagnostics. I am very happy going there, they tell me the truth about my car and keep me safe and running. Will use them first and have no issue recommending them.]
