[109367197512428305524,100009843201981930211,We have been seeing Dr. Carmichael and the other vets at Lake City Animal Hospital since April 2003. We continue to use them with our current pets. They are extremely professional and polite and we have encountered nothing but the best service. Last year when we lost our oldest dog, the staff was more accommodating, caring, and helpful than I would have ever expected and more so than I have heard from friends' vets. The constant communication regarding test results and labwork was exemplary. Just like human doctors, they are not miracle workers, but they do everything they can to care for our pets. Honestly, I feel the vets and staff at Lake City Animal Hospital offer better care and service than most general practitioners these days!]
