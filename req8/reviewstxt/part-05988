[115858547203795448473,100476728480088132831,I had created a t-shirt design for our school's program and submitted it to CreateMyTee thinking the design was going to be too complicated. To our surprise, the t-shirt artist was able to make the design work perfectly and in no time at all. Seeing that the design would work, over the next two months our program fussed over design details, shirt colors and styles. The representative and artist I worked with were both extremely helpful, polite, patient and understanding throughout the entire process. They were also very quick to respond to any questions and were able to come up with great recommendations and sample artwork. We just received the shirts today and we couldn't be more pleased with how they turned out! Many thanks!]
