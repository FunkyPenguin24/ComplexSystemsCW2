[112419613007734151346,100276661001780574262,I broke the LCD screen on my Samsum Galaxy SII and thought I'd get it professionally repaired rather than do it myself. Gophermods made the entire process remarkably simple, affordable and very quick. The website was very easy to use, place the order, and complete the checkout. From that point, they shipped my phone in about 3 business days and pronto - I had a working phone with absolutely no glitches. Fine worksmanship, quick turnaround and only $50 more than what the LCD would've cost on eBay. Very well done guys.]
