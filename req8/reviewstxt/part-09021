[106593097601310048156,100639844375777144239,NEVER AGAIN WILL I GO HERE. I took my kitten in for her new shots and it was outrageously expensive. Not to mention how mean they were to her. They put the shot in her arm and when i asked to put it somewhere else since it hurt her so much, they refused and she missed her skin which soaked her fur in the medicine. The doctor said she needed to clean it off or it would cause mouth ulcers. when they couldn't get the needle in from her squirming they Took her to the back where i could hear her screaming from the pain. I trusted she cleaned the area well enough so my cat didn't lick it but a couple weeks later i found a sore on my cats mouth. I compared the sore to pictures and it looked like an ulcer (which the doctor said would happen if she didn't clean it). i took her in and they had no idea what is was but still charged me for a full visit and tried to give her a shot for another $30. I would defiantly not recommend this place to anyone who loves their pet!]
