[112920679756612185043,101010976050996792903,Last Tuesday I took advantage of the Chevrolet "Sign and Drive" promotion to buy a 2013 Chevy Camaro from Findlay Chevrolet in Las Vegas. Although my primary residence is in Arizona, over the past couple of years I have found myself working in Las Vegas so much that my car rental expenses have come in at well over $600 a month on average, So I decided to contact somebody I know that works at Findlay Chevrolet and see what kind of deal I could get. After several text messages, I drove out to the dealership and met with my friend, Jamaal McCoy who is the dealership GM. I met Jamaal at an industry event in Miami a couple years ago and we have stayed in contact since. Jamaal asked me to work with a salesman at the dealership by the name of "Larry". Larry was fairly new, but was exceptionally helpful and pulled up 3 2013 Chevy Camaros in different colors that met my equipment requirements... Right away i knew that I wanted the black one... very good looking car! When Jamaal presented the deal to me, including trading in a 2006 Mercury Mariner that I needed to dispose of for a relative that lives in Las Vegas, I was VERY pleasantly surprised. The monthly payments with no money down, and negative equity of about $1,200 in my trade-in came out to less than $375 a month. I smiled, accepted the deal and thanked Jamaal for his courteous treatment and better than expected numbers. After going through the documentation process, getting our complimentary accessories from their accessory department, a Findlay Chevy employee who specializes in doing vehicle deliveries took me through all the new Camaro's systems, Bluetooth set up with my phone and made sure I knew how to operate the vehicle... Away we went, in one of the smoothest and most aggravation free new car buying experiences I have ever had.]
