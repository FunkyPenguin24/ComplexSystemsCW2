[115790905619191880242,100948227445445651929,About 3 weeks ago we went to our cousins birthday party and really enjoyed the atmosphere and the private dining. Food was sooo good and the music was awesome. I really enjoyed the DJ how he mixes the music with the videos. We liked it so much that we are going back for date night (my wife and I). Keep up the good work Grand Agave. We love it there.... JJ]
