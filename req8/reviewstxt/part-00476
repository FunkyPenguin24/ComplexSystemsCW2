[118421410792291372777,100183789827507099099,Poor value for money. Saying it's basic accommodation is an understatement. While we found it clean enough the place looks old and outdated. Cracked and broken tiling in bathroom with no hot water service in wash basin. Low wattage lighting in rooms is awful. Very slow service at the in house restaurant. As a two night relaxing experience it leaves a lot to be. We'll not be back there again.]
