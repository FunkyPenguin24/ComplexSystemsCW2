[105891684095578695664,100772342831474981032,Hats off to Alan and staff for the ambience, unfailing courtesy and being so friendly. Wonderful lawn and gardens at all times of the year. Of course, not forgetting the food. We eat there most weeks (Sunday Lunch) and with an ever-changing menu there is no chance of getting bored. Try the cheesecake! Excellent wines!]
