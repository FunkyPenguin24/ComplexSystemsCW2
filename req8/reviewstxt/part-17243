[116795575373448763316,101089085657462415306,BAD! When you walk through the door the first thing you see is a very small room. This room has no door, it has steel bars like you would seen in a prison this is for the children under 2. My daughter enrolled my Granddaughters into this place. I turned and seen the youngest with her face pressed to the bars crying as we left. It is filthy as the other person posted. I had my two year old Granddaughter in the car. She messed her Diaper just before we got there to pick up my other Granddaughter. My wife took her in and asked if she could change her Diaper. Even though she is enrolled she was told no! When asked why... they stated they had just cleaned the upstairs and there was no place to do it??? My wife became angry and asked if she could change her on the floor. In a rude tone she was told no. That would not be sanitary. Nothing more to say, that was their last day their. We got them enrolled in the learning tree. A-1 place, so much more more room, open areas, NO BARS! Friendly, clean but most of all less expensive that Destinations! And is currently working with Granite School district. Kids are Doing great. Destinations Has some real issues. I believe they are currently trying to sell it. They need to do something. It is a dive.]
