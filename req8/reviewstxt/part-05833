[112417904085749987687,100468296427359657602,If you are in the market to buy a Ford, this is the place to go! Ask for Shane Robertson. He made the entire car buying process seem like we were shopping with an extremely knowledgeable friend. He never pushed us on our budget, and he found EXACTLY the car we wanted at just the right price! The finance staff was also very helpful in explaining each deal that was available to us, and we really felt like they were working FOR us to get us the car we wanted at the best possible price. We're now driving around town in our new 2014 Ford Escape as happy as can be (without any of that dreaded buyer's remorse after big purchases). Thanks Galpin and Shane!]
