[103173046149319164973,100025896103599256020,This is a gem of an import food store. Their specialty is Middle Eastern items. I have been a customer since about 2004 & every time I go back it seems to have expanded. This store is absolutely, truly authentic. The chicken biryani from the kitchen is unsurpassed. The selection of imported teas & coffee is extensive. The spice aisle (my favorite) overwhelms. My wife loves the huge selection of lentils, garbanzo, fava, olives, etc. All imported. I love pomegranate juice & they carry the true, unfiltered, non-sugar-added juice. Not the hyper filtered, sugar laden crap produced domestically. The butcher section has to be seen to be believed. To sum up in one word: AUTHENTIC.]
