[102950853233813014796,101007180051412738553,Just picked up my Mark Schneider ring for my 50th Birthday. We ordered it when Mark Schneider was at Spectrum Art and Jewelry in Wilmington NC. It was awesome to meet Mark and know that my ring was going to be custom made to our specifications. Star Sosa was awesome in helping us select a diamond to complete the setting. We couldn't be happier with our experience. We hoped the ring would be here in time for my birthday and it arrived a few days early. They went above and beyond to have our custom order completed. We'll be taking my old settings in to Spectrum Art and Jewelry to be redesigned and reset into some kind of new piece/s. Star has an awesome program that allows you to see new designs and make your own one of a kind piece. We are looking forward to designing something new.]
