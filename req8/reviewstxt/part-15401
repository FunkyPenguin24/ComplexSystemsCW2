[104769672668097986541,100987808213971444882,I've gone here 3 times. Each time my food was made incorrectly and I needed to send it back. My food was also cold not only the first time it came out but also the second. I ordered the chicken alfredo (can't remember what it's called exactly), but it comes with veggies on it. I ordered it without veggies, and they couldn't get it right, Our waiter one time even said to me "Oh I saw your food was made wrong in the kitchen, but I didn't have time to send it back." What kind of waiter says that? Another time we waited 45 minutes just to order our food. The restaurant was not busy at all. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!]
