[117643216883729094780,100155358989900681554,I would put half a star if it's possible because ever since I came here my first day I wanted to change hotel but they wouldn't give me my money back also I got switched rooms 2 times. Heater was not working and they just provided me with a tinny electric heater. They just want to take advantage of the tourist. Even they charge for a cup of ice. Defiantly not a place to stay can't wait till I get out of this place.]
