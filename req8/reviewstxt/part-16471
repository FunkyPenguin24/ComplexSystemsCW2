[115549804023923004495,101045576895705916885,This is the second time I tried tropical for lunch and was disappointed. The first time I receive about a half ounce of chicken in my flatbread sandwich. The second time I ordered the Wasabi Roast Beef on the Ciabatta bread. This is false advertising as the “Ciabatta” was nothing more than a puffed up version of their flat bread, nothing more than a mushy tasteless roll. Real Ciabatta bread has a crisp crust, a somewhat soft, porous texture. For something with Wasabi in the name it was amazingly bland. I understand the smoothies are good, I don’t recommend the sandwiches.]
