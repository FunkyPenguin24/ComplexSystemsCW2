[105369726819144205982,100770319235936148623,Chango's has a unique take on mexican food - you won't find anything like it anywhere else in town. Couple that with the fact that it's also really good, and you've got a clear win. The taco's often garner the most attention, but the burritos have always been the draw for me. Go with the mashed black beans. Far and away the best burrito in town. Any time you buck the trend and create your own flavor, it's certain not to hit the mark for everyone. But for me, Chango's is a solid bulls eye.]
