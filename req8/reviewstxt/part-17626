[101401040527121018213,101110207500271752674,I love Lake Chabot Golf Course . It is a challenging course that is maintained very well. Their greens are consistently smooth. My only complaint is that the pace of play is too slow due to poor marshaling. I believe that this course could speed up play by reminding golfers of their responsibility to get behind the cage at nine and waving up the next group.]
