[117447774953319892386,101088064492513411034,I highly recommend Chris Boswell!! I came to Chris about a year ago after being referred by a few friends. I was looking for a smaller vehicle that was better on gas & a cheaper payment. He was extremely helpful! Since I purchased my used Honda Accord from him, anytime I have had a question or issue he has continued to guide me in the right direction. There was no pressure in the least at anytime. He presented everything in a very straight forward, not confusing manner. All in all, my experience was absolutely wonderful. I didn't feel like I had to be on guard at every corner, for fear of being ripped off...Chris is trust-worthy and helpful. I will definitely do business with him in the future if I am in the market for another car. And would highly recommend Chris to anyone!!! You can tell he cares about his customers.]
