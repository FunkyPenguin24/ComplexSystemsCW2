[113830836298968886906,101017473521443019541,I've never met a Chiropractor with as much knowledge of anatomy as Dr. J. She is diligent and has only one goal in mind... Get you better so she doesn't need to see you all the time! I've had so many chiropractors in the past just crack me up and send me on my way but not here. She is invested in making your life better and healthier. She will give you "homework" to get better and hold you accountable. I'll never have another chiropractor again as long as she is in business. Thank you for being awesome. Tommy]
