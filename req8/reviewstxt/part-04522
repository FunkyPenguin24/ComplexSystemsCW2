[100485397800747400110,100400054112629558186,Miller's Ale House is always a favorite of mine. They have great food at a good price. The atmosphere is always up beat and great for any time of sports game. My favorite thing on the menu are the Zingers. The chicken nachos are also awesome! Piled high with tons of toppings! Also their famous Zingers are a great selection too. My wife's favorite food on the menu is the Zinger tacos.]
