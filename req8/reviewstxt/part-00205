[101838481869107306339,100169940627778425095,Our stay at the hotel was goo. My children really enjoyed the pool area and game room. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. Breakfast could use some improvements as we prefer fresh fruit to canned fruit cocktail.When we went down there was no breakfast attendant and many of the things we needed were empty. I was very disappointed to find when i got home that I had been charged twice for my room. The lady who checked me in had trouble with the credit card machine and charged me twice. When I called the hotel to get this fixed they said they couldn't do it right away as it was a Saturday and that I would need to call back Monday and have them fix it! :( This to me is very frustrating!]
