[106441845472370039681,100749440191617596638,We recently bought a 2010 CRV from Honda World Downey and we were very impressed with the service offered there. Having never bought a car from a dealership, we were very wary of being taken advantage of, and our guard was up. However, we were very pleasantly surprised how well we were taken care of. There was some confusion regarding the price of the car, and Saul Hernandez, Vanesa Avellaneda, George Beltran and Ronnie Williams bent over backwards to make sure we were happy. Felix in the loan department also ensured that we were comfortable with the whole process and made it very enjoyable. I would absolutely recommend buying a car from them- we adore our new CRV and couldn't be happier with how it all worked out. We got an amazing deal on a truly great SUV, and Honda World treated us fairly and kindly. Service is clearly a top priority with them, and it shows. Thank you!]
