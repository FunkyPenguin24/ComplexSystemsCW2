[104869530081703999442,100263424311302859617,I have used Active Body to address chronic back pain and training-induced hip pain. In both instances, they made quick, correct diagnoses, and resolved the pain quickly, just as they said they would. The doctors and the staff are tremendous. While I do not look forward to training injuries, I do look forward to having a reason to visit Active Body.]
