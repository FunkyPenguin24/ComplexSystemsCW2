[113907926834567870396,100700057262914021021,Terrible service staff! Was met with indifference by the service dept. representative and virtually no help in selecting components to add to my bike (which I bought there). After having the components installed, the staff members were noticeably 'put-upon' to make two minor (30 seconds) adjustments . They then complained that they have 30 bikes per day come in for repair. Expect extraordinarily surly– although timely– service.]
