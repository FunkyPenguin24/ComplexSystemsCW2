[100668389996595440088,100890866748972594913,I was here for 4 weeks back in 2009, and have recently stayed again. Very comfortable, quiet and conveniant. Right across the road (3 mins walk) from the shinjuku South exit. Easy walking distance to yoyogi, harajuku and also shibuya. Right on the Yamanote line so you can travel anywhere in Tokyo (metro) with ease. I loved it so much, I moved to Japan to live :D.]
