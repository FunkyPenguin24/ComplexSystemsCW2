[109399751418407320849,100683216134488158514,I went there along with my wife in April 2012. At that time the quality of food was excellent. A real Pakistani taste in USA. That reminded me the taste of original Pakistani food of Pakistani restaurant in Pakistan. We ordered Haleem, Kabob, and Tawa Chiken. Ambience is normal but food is highly highly recommended. Do not miss it give it a try and I am sure you wont gona miss it again. Regards]
