[112650448201495157784,100075022007799779549,We arrived at Fairfield Inn around 9:30pm. When we entered the room we noticed towels on the floor. Upon further inspection the bed was not made and trash was not emptied. We had to return to the lobby and was told the room had not been cleaned, needless to say this left a very bad impression on us. We were given different rooms and checked out the next day, Manager on duty was apologetic. The breakfast the next morning left a lot to the imagination, one of worst I have seen. Upon returning home I realized I left a sweater in the room. While I know this was my mistake the way the Manager ( Christi Gadd) handled it was poor. I called the hotel around 8:00am explained my dilemma hoping to find the sweater. I was told I would receive a call back shortly. I finally had to call the hotel and spoke to a front desk person who put me on hold returned and said they could not find the sweater. Very poor customer service all the way around.]
