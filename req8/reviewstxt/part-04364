[118364023177632981063,100390870511121993406,Someone needs a lesson in cleaning! This hotel is filthy. The carpeting has not been cleaned in a very long time and has stains and a general overall dirty look to it. Nobody bothered to take even a carpet sweeper to pick up crumbs throughout the week-end we were there. Crumbs in the diningroom on Friday night were still there when we left Sunday. Bathtub and sink were scratched and yellowed and a thick layer of dust lay atop the shower surround. Walls were disgusting throughout with stains and marks. Curtains had dust and cobwebs on them. One of the beds had been made but not changed from the last guest as could be seen by a layer of human hair. The dining room carpet was very dirty. Breakfast was poor with little selection and the coffee and hot water were lukewarm. Our keys didn't work which meant multiple trips up and down the stairs (no elevator). We (large group of us) come to town annually to shop. We needed 4 rooms this year. No tip was left. Manager needs to raise his cleanliness standards. This used to be a very nice hotel!]
