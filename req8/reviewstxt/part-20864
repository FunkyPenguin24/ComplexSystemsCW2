[100208424199240151767,100105960290403092892,Having being displaced due to flooding in my neighborhood I was tired, overwhelmed, and almost in a state of shock. This was my third storage facility. Ms. Karen was kind, professional, and most of all- helpful. Karen is so knowledgeable. I described the amount of things we were able to save and she suggested the size unit we'd need. She was happy to show me the unit. Service has been great from the moment I walked through the door until now. And the price was best of the three!]
