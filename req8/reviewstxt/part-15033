[101555472897141487969,100968585444247689171,My previous driving instructor decided to abandon me a week before my test where the standard of my driving (according to Neil) just wasn't up to scratch. I started calling around and Neil understood my situation, put some time aside and committed to helping me rectify as much of my weaknesses as possible in ~4 hours. He was fantastic, really hands on and not afraid to really push you into shape. You can immediately tells that he cares about your performance. An honest, realistic and highly experienced instructor. In the end, I passed first time with one fault; it definitely pays to keep calm.]
