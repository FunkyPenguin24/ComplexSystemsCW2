[101301779540216588344,100211247456928774958,A former first degree black belt in Taekwondo, I stumbled across YB World Taekwondo Academy two years ago after an extended hiatus from the martial art. Three months and thirty pounds later, I was feeling physically better and more confident than I had ever been. I'm now in the best shape of my life and well on my way to second degree. YB World Taekwondo has provided me with intense and enjoyable physical fitness via expert instruction that has also cultivated in me a previously unseen degree of discipline and mental well-being. I'm healthier, happier, and more self-assured. I think that speaks for itself.]
