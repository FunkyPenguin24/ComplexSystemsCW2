[108906631875724749810,101062100158159483464,I went to the Norwood Contours Face & Body Clinic last month for the first time as I was seeking a clinical solution to achieve healthy and youthful skin. The girls there are so nice and friendly. A cup of peppermint tea definitely made me feel really cozy before the treatment. The girls gave me their honest and professional opinions on what treatments and products would be best for me and I was absolutely amazed by the stunning results after just two treatments. The Microdermabrasion is amazing and the Radio Frequency Treatment afterwards just boosted the results. The treatment packages are well priced and the products are more affordable than I thought. I thoroughly enjoyed the whole process and am eagerly looking forward to going back for more treatments. I would definitely recommend Contours Face and Body Clinic to everyone.]
