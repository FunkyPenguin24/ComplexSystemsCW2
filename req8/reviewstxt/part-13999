[104018482515056516362,100911360584675192545,Tried Cherry Village for the first time, I must say it was awesome. Great Food, Excellent Service and more than reasonable price. We did the "DINNER for TWO". Very clean and great atmosphere. Highly recommend for anybody looking for Great Chinese Food that doesn't have the word "Panda" in it's name.]
