[108843221112106058903,100418358594527540904,I always feel a little overwhelmed and more than a little stressed as I anticipate a major purchase. It was no different when I entered the showroom at Hendrick Hyundai. From the moment I walked in, I was welcomed with warmth, consideration, and competence from every individual I encountered. My Sales Representative, Don Robinson, was friendly, courteous,and very well-versed on the array of features in the 2013 Genesis. He was clearly enthusiastic about this automobile, and that enthusiasm came through as he described some of the "little extras" we don't often think about ... like the auto-dimming of the rear-view mirror, and theatre-style elevation of the back seats (so your back seat passenger has a better view). In Finance, Morgan Sauls was thorough, knowledgable, and reassured me over the concerns I had about credit scores, current interest rates, lenders, etc. He guided me through the process, while providing detailed information on every aspect of the financing, and keeping me appraised of his progress towards completion of my purchase. It is clear that Customer Satisfaction is a priority of everyone at Hendrick Hyundai. These welcoming, enthusiastic, knowledgeable individuals are all dedicated to providing a positive experience now, and to building a relationship that will continue for years to come.]
