[114284414212555202921,100864557900947071018,I am associated with Saras Prayas since beginning and really cannot explain the feeling of pride it gives to me being a part of such an association.. This group is all about doing every possible effort to improve or create confidence in socially deprived children/people.. Taking part in activities had made me aware about how talented the people of ignored world are and how it could be of use to this current general world in which we live in.. This group has taught me how important and usefull it is to be simple, helpful and what the joy of giving is.. Thanks to the team of SP... Plz come and join...:)]
