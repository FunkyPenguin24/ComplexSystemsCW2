[112001778543364198922,100039192172712172556,Mostly friendly staff, but I had a terrible experience with them. After talking with a member of their staff on Saturday, I did as he suggested and called this morning shortly after they opened to schedule a service call to repair my dryer. They were supposed to be here around 12:30-1 p.m.. and I made sure to detail specifically the address, apartment number, and complex name, as well as provide my full phone number. After it got to being a good 45 minutes after they were supposed to show up, or at least call, I called their office to get a status update. I was assured they'd be heading my way in "15-20 minutes, top." I continued waiting, being in my apartment since 12:20, until I finally got a phone call at 2:25. They claimed that they'd just gotten back to their shop, after nobody answering the door at my apartment. I tried to clarify which complex they went to, if they'd gotten confused or something - they claimed flat out that they'd knocked on my apartment door, that it was the right one, and that nobody had answered. I'd been waiting here for 2 hours, nobody ever knocked on my door. Nor did they bother to call me to see if I was there, or seek help in finding my apartment. They refused to admit any fault or mistake on their part, refused to come back out the same day, and only offered to reschedule for later in the week.]
