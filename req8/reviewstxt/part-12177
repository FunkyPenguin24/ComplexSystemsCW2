[101193785423701478766,100810485567436808644,A very pleasant experience overall. We stayed there for one night; upon arrival quite early in the morning we were checked in quickly and courteously. The room was clean, comfortable and well appointed, though quite small. It is a short walk to the river from the hotel. Would definitely recommend to friends and stay there again.]
