[101731978144650412987,100844152760068234523,Mike is outstanding. He's done our house inside and out. Perfection is his middle name. On time, On Budget, and quality paint and results. Mike and his team made the whole process easy, They are very clean... No over-spray anywhere, and took care of our flowers and shrubs. I appreciate the little things he did. The scraping, caulking, the priming, made the house look amazing... Thank You Mike.]
