[113926656413012246225,100594190524883136250,I recently enrolled both of my sons (5 and 3 yo) into their school. It has only been 6 weeks but I have seen a tremendous improvement in their swimming behavior. The staff is very friendly, but they push the kids in a good way. There was some crying in the beginning but that improved within a couple of weeks. In the beginning, both were unwilling to even put their faces in the water. Now my 5 yo can actually swim a few strokes unassisted and my 3 yo is diving under the water for toys. Not only has it helped with swimming, but bath time is much easier now (what a bonus!) We love Aqua-tots!]
