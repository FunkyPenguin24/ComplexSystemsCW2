[105419240237633685812,100815482104779451394,If you're a fan of chile con queso then you have to visit El Pinto. That's just one of the fine reasons to eat at New Mexico's largest restaurants. It's atmosphere, healthy food (yes you can make healthy Mexican food without sacrificing a thing) and it's helpful, friendly staff make this the winner in every "Best of Albuquerque" publication around. The queso is made with real chilies and everyone loves El Pinto's salsa and chips, made fresh on the premises each day. If you're coming from I-25 make sure to obey the posted speed limits. You pass through the Sandia Pueblo area and the police there love to write tickets. Have fun.]
