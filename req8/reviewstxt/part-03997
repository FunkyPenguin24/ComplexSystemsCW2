[107962630247348768100,100369257415743367286,The Bellevue office is about a 30 minute drive for me but it's worth every minute behind the wheel. Everyone that works there are extremely nice and courteous. The ladies at the front desk are great and even helped my wife keep my 3 year old entertained during my visits. Chris, the office manager is great about explaining the treatment plan to you and will help you in any way possible to get everything he can covered by your insurance. The ladies in the back are very sweet and caring and will make you feel totally comfortable even if you're absolutely terrified of going to the dentist like myself. Dr. Rose and Dr. Dan are the two best dentists in Tennessee! I'm not just saying that to be polite in a review, I'm trusting them with $40,000 (before insurance thank goodness!) in dental work to repair my teeth that were in absolute horrid shape from having to take antibiotics for an extended period of time because of a motorcycle accident and it literally ruined my teeth. So you can take my word for it, you won't regret making these guys to go to people for all of your dental needs. They will give you a beautiful smile that you can be extremely proud to show off! They can take care of everything from routine cleanings to same day crowns (CEREC) to dental implants to replace missing teeth and if you're scared of the dentist, Dr. Rose is even able to do conscious sedation and you'll never even hear or feel those dreaded drills! I'm actually smiling for the first time in over 20 years instead of trying to hide my teeth. Don't take my word for it though. Go talk to them, meet them, and find out for yourself! You'll be very happy you did!]
