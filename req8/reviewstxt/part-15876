[104371894750848743899,101014488619642900549,Peter Soh has been my CPA since 2008. When I met with him, I was starting finishing school and working on my business concept. Peter provided me great advices, critical information related to taxes, up-to-date explanations about business structures, great suggestions for foreign entrepreneurs in the USA and personalized assistance about bookkeeping and Quickbooks. Peter also brought a cross-cultural perspective to his work, which is invaluable in our global society. Hiring Peter Soh to form and register U in the USA LLC was the best decision I ever made.]
