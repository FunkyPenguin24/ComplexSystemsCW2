[102685697504735179142,100867383654496854795,Got an awesome tattoo done here yesterday. The artist, with my permission, even altered the design a bit, and I love it more than I thought I would. My brother got one as well and he gave us a (very small) discount, but managed to get both of ours done in less than an hour. The only thing I would say that bothered me was that he never introduced himself or chatted during the process...so I don`t even know his name to recommend him to anyone else! But he was very good. Would definitely go back next time I`m in the city.]
