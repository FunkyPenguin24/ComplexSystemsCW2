[105570543738549636368,100266677924805682542,Great Atmosphere, beautiful location- great to go to Ashridge Estate for a long walk before. Can get extremely busy so would definitely recommend to book- especially at the weekend. Sometimes the service is a very slow due to how busy it gets, but that’s fine as we always enjoy our time there. We always take visitors there as it is so “typically British chic”.]
