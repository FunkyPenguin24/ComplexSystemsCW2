[116902924181251176878,101061780855700909022,I am giving 5 stars for all areas because of the amazing service I always receive. I just bought my second car at Glockner (Beford) and I can not imagine ever going anywhere else! Drew listened to every detail of what I was looking for and made sure I was comfortable while I waited for JL to find me a great deal. Even though Drew did not offer me beef jerky, he did get me my favorite drink! To top off the whole experience, Monica was so sweet and made sure the paperwork process was as quick and efficient as possible. I really feel like more than just a customer. Everyone is genuinely concerned about making me happy and meeting my needs. I would absolutely recommend this dealership to anyone!]
