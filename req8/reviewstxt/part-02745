[107489407173818784311,100300493646803344264,THEY ARE NOT EVEN WORTH ONE STAR! THIS COMPANY IS A PIECE OF GARBAGE. NOT ONLY DID THEY UPSELL US BY A FEW THOUSAND DOLLARS WHEN THEY DELIEVERED OUR SECTIONAL IT WAS NOT ONLY SCRATCHED AND DENTED BUT IT HAD LEGITIMATE HOLES IN IT. TEARS THAT YOU WOULD EXPECT TO SEE FROM A SECTIONAL SEVERAL DECADES OLD. WHEN WE CALLED THE STORE TO TALK TO THEM ABOUT IT WE WERE TREATED HORRIBLY, CALLED NAMES, AND TOLD THAT "IN THE BUCKET OF ASHLEY FURNATURE WE ARE NOT EVEN A DROP OF WATER". AFTER SPENDING $5,000.00 ON NEW FURNATURE I WOULD EXPECT TO BE TREATED DIFFERENT. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME GOING HERE... YOU'DE BE BETTER OFF KEEPING YOUR CURRENT STUFF AT THIS POINT..... SHOUT OUT TO MICHELLE WHO WORKS THERE.... YOU SHOULD PROBABLY QUIT YOUR DAY JOB. YOU ARE A HORRIBLE SALES WOMAN AND YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TALK TO CUSTOMERS THE WAY THAT YOU DO. YOU ARE A SCAM ARTIST BY EVERY DEFINITION OF THE PHRASE.]
