[101926580965276295914,100629669185803076639,I had the privilege of working with John and Mike at LaunchPad Studios in creation of my debut album in 2010. From scratch track to CD jacket they were there to help me see my project through to completion. I worked closely with John in co-producing the album sound, coordinating studio musicians when I needed them, organizing tracking and listening sessions around my busy work schedule and all the while being encouraged in developing my own personality and style into each track. It was a blessing every step of the way. When it came to mixing and mastering the project I often found myself saying "Mike…because of you I believe in magic!" Making my dream of an original album both affordable and enjoyable - I couldn't have asked for a better studio to work in on this project. Hold Hope is an album anthology of years of personal journey in music and they helped bring it to life and make it shareable to the masses. I would highly recommend anyone that needs a great recording space, engineers who won't cut corners on quality or a set of production ears to give quality musical feedback….these are your people. Thank you LaunchPad…..until next time!]
