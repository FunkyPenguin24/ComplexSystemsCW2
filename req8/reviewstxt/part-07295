[110340346229436436936,100548832699144198974,We shopped many different models of cars this time around before finally settling on a Nissan Pathfinder. From the beginning our salesperson, Campbell Lovett, went absolutely out of his way to make sure he was there for us. My specs had to be shipped from out of town and he was on top of the process the entire time. And even though the car wasn't on their lot, we got our target price for it and the negotiation was simple and smooth. They even gave me a very fair price on a 10-year-old trade-in, better than CarMax and Auction Direct. Everyone we dealt with was absolutely great and have still been there for all of my questions even AFTER the purchase. I couldn't be more pleased with the dealership, our salesperson, our car or the transaction. Thank you Leith!]
