[102043286018758386645,101025356963282320991,service was good. food took almost a half hour before we got it. the food was cold, not cooked and gross. when we expressed our opinion to our server she took care of everything. the manager didn't even come over to apologize or do anything to get us for future business. I will never go back there or recommend it.]
