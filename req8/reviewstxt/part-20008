[100059581774418128123,100060589004437897746,A bit dubious at first but totally loved the experience. Couldn't believe how close we were to the penguins or how beautiful the setting is. The trails and guides excellent. I recommend you take the latest tour you can--ours was 5:45 pm. Lots of penguins about and they are so cute. Your fee helps protect them.]
