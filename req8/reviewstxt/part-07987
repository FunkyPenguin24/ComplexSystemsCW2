[108225481410403297714,100587054186873793924,Great place for kids! We took our two boys and they loved it. The cost of admission is a little steep if you ask me($12/ person, ages 1 & up), so it cost us $48 for our family of four to get in. I was initially worried we wouldn't get our moneys worth, but that being said, the kids had a blast. There are quite a few exhibits, and pretty much everything is interactive for the kids. There are things for small kids as well as big kids. They have a large play area for small toddlers with plenty of toys, and its surrounded by a wall(with doors that can only be opened by adults). Parents can sit on the benches and watch their little ones play without fear of them running off into the rest of the museum. All in all, I would highly recommend. There is a Jason's Deli located inside the museum as well. Admission is a little high, but the kids loved it.]
