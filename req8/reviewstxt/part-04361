[115474375371864010704,100390603299556718127,This dealership is the most annoying, useless, waste of time ever, and I would not even bother to check them out based on their spamming marketing practices. I have been looking for a specific type and model of car and on craigslist. Their advertisements keep showing up, and spamming the entire list. And even worse, the say they are located everywhere from Costa Mesa to Malibu, when they really are not. Now that being said, I have never actually been to their dealership. But there marketing practices of spamming the heck out of craigslist makes me never want to go there, no matter what type of deal it is. I can't imagine how annoying it would be to deal with these people in real life, rather than just online.]
