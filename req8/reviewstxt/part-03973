[110052483852318331464,100367912789218320016,In the month of August 2013 my family and I visited Church Bay in order to go snorkeling and swimming. We found the experience to be delightful. In comparison to the other beaches on the south side there were very few people at Church Bay. This made the time that we spent there very private and wonderful. The snorkeling was excellent and I would recommend this beach to all. I sincerely hope your experience there will be as wonderful as ours. TTFN]
