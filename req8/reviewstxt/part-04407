[108442760285978318611,100392869698646522743,Nice property but the quality of the food and staff attitude are not up to par with the reputation of the brand. Would not choose to stay here again if I could find another option. The management approach of this property is reflected in the laxity of the wait staff and surly attitude of desk personnel. I found them discourteous and inattentive. They were more interested in continuing conversations with their co-workers than seeing to the needs of the guests. The food bar was empty and not attended, the coffee bar had no cups or creamer etc. (on multiple occasions). The elevators when they worked were slow and unkempt. For a property in the Hilton Honors program this hotel gets a C- which is not a high enough grade to warrant a return visit by us. If you have high standards and expect to be appreciated for your business this is not the stay for you.]
