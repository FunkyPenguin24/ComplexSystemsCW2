[116860340631108196590,100937596078470918301,I have been to Buffalo Wild Wings in Port Chester twice and have been disappointed both times. Wings are below average, not crisp and the Buffalo sauce is too thick. The wings always look like they have spent too much time under the heat lamp before they make their way out to the table. We tried the nachos today and they had hardly any toppings on the chips. When we asked Frank our waiter he apologized, took them off the bill and told us that was normal. All is all for wings, nachos and fried food you can go better and just about any pub in Westchester. If you are going to the movies next door, take a walk down Main Street in Port Chester and go to Q. You will be happy.]
