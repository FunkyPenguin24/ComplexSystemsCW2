[109101326078747048654,100944510458460337170,I have been to St. Anne's twice with a Diva for a Day package and both times it was simply perfect. The staff are amazing, they even planned a special afternoon snack for me because I am allergic to nuts and could not eat their usual snacks. The spa facilities are wonderful, the yoga classes very relaxing, and the grounds are beautiful for walking around. I wish we could stay overnight - something to dream about! Can't wait to go back!]
