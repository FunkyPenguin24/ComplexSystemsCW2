[106413000669926924308,100533872344198336746,This is our weekly pub. Every Sunday night, for years, our local gang of geek friends meets up here. Did you know Grendel's won a Supreme Court case? Did you know the letters in their name rearrange to form the words "Nerd Legends"? The beer is good, and the food is certainly a good deal when half-priced. My recommendation is the Natural Disaster burger with a veggie patty -- what I get every time I go!]
