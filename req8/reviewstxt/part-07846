[103436551470329024881,100579808772248217299,Waited for 35 minutes for a very small order for a family of 4, we also timed it . Thats the first time I had ever eaten there. I went again they forgot my order and the service is terrible I mean absolutely horrid!!!!!! I asked for sauce got none, then I was told one time I wasn't allowed to have any. They had no food ready when I came. The franchise owner or KFC needs to fire every last one of them and put people there who actually care about their job. People should just be happy they have a job. Since they do not care about their job how can they care for a customer. I will not under any circumstance be going back there EVER AGAIN! even if it were the last place in the world that had food!!!!!!! KFC get your game right!!!! Fire those jerks and get some people who care! I recommend Bojangles! Awesome Service and good cajun chicken!]
