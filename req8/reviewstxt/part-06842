[108622175531734450356,100524350160128066545,I survived and 18 Wheeler collision in my 3 month old Tundra from AutoNation. After my now 4th purchase from them, I'm proud to be a loyal customer! Walter Rozier and Nick Drake were awesome. Laid back, no pressure, and can beat the pants off any other Toyota dealer in the area. Lifetime oil changes? Good Bye RR Toyota! AutoNation is my continued preferred provider, and Toyota's are the most safe cars on the road. I know, I was smashed safely between a concrete barrier wall and that trailer in bumper to bumper traffic with concrete barriers on both lanes of I35E South! Can't beat AutonNation's customer service or price!]
