[116992682601561835555,100491436759822363346,Absolutely my favorite Dentist. Dr LoParo delivers on every aspect of the we need in a dentist; he's highly skilled, explains in detail what's going on with your teeth & gums, what your options are and how much each option is going to cost (factoring in your insurance coverage). That works for me plus, it's a pain-free experience in every aspect and just a great guy on top of all that. Dr LoParo's staff and dental assistants and techs are a reflection the standards he has set & maintains completing the whole dental experience. Remember how you use to hate to go to the dentist? Those days are over for Dr LoParo's patients so if you're looking for a dentist because your doesn't quite fit the bill or if you're new to the Charlotte (like I was) don't look any further.]
