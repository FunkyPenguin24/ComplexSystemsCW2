[115863667242659191326,100552079676060063715,As someone who has traveled North America and other countries, I am always looking for spa experiences that will allow me to shift my mind to relaxing and finding my center. I was grateful to find that Koru Touch has mastered what it means to sensually be taken to a peaceful place, which in turn allows one to just pleasantly be. From the steam room, sauna and hot tub to the exquisite services of massaging, grooming and facials, one finds the sense of touch, scent, sight, taste and hearing pleasurable through the entirety of the experience. Summing up: If you are looking for an escape - go. If you are looking for a spa service - go. If you are looking for day of beauty - go. The only question you should ask is, why aren't you there yet?]
