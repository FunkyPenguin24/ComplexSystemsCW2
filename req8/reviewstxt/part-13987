[108918784198070828419,100910616857648025116,Do NOT use this cleaning company. After showing up four hours late, the cleaner declared our flat 'Schmelchy' and, as per David's review below, also tried to charge more than the agreed price. However, it gets worse. They cleaned the fridge and threw out pretty much everything in it, including my dinner for that evening, which I'd only made the evening before. This was frustrating, but what was most shocking was discovering their random acts of vandalism/theft in the bathroom and kitchen. I discovered a treasured ceramic bowl from the bathroom broken to pieces in the black bin liners the cleaners had left outside, along with a MAC eyeshadow. I've still not been able to find the lipstick that was in the bowl, so can only assume it was thrown away/stolen. In addition, I found that some chocolates had also been taken from a tin in the kitchen. I was absolutely incensed that the cleaners had caused around £40 worth of theft/damage, particularly as we had paid £90 for the privilege. Emails of complaint have - unsurprisingly - resulted in nothing but a 'We're sorry, we're looking into this' email. DO NOT use this company. Not unless you don't value any of your belongings.]
