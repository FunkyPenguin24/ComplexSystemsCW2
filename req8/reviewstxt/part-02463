[102397386828785137876,100285871679803670981,I came to Muse and started seeing Sophia around 6 months ago in the fall of 2013. Sophia's approach in getting to know me was absolutely wonderful, and just what I needed. Sophia did a great job getting to know me, my likes/dislikes, and what I was trying to achieve with my hair. When I first came to see Sophia, my hair felt like it was thinning out on the ends and the color was starting to look too fake-blonde. After only six months, my hair is back to it's original fullness, the color is absolutely perfect, and my hair is growing much faster and stronger than it was before. Sophia does a great job taking care of your hair, while keeping it gorgeous! Recently, I went in for balayage, instead of foil highlights. I was completely amazed by how beautiful and natural-looking the color was/is! I am already getting a ton of complements from friends and family -- all wanting to know who takes care of my hair! After doing balayage, I will never go back to foil highlights! I am beyond satisfied with Sophia's work with balayage and my hair! I can't express how thankful I am for Muse Salon and for Sophia!! She is absolutely amazing and I highly recommend her!!]
