[108262694872747989721,100539843059145000314,2 years ago I was soon to be getting married and my fianc√©'s car needed tires, being low on money I thought I would shop around, this was a mistake. I went to firestone and about half way through I was regretting it. I felt like they wanted to charge me for every little process thus bringing the end price up to the competitions. I should have gone to shwab, in addition they were really pushing their protection plan for the tires. I refused it. Though now two year later and 38,000 miles later a bulge on the drivers side sidewall formed. I had my wife take the car in, because the tires have 60,000 mile warranty. They claimed that the bulge was road damage, even though it was not on the curb side of the car and was clearly a manufacture defect. My wife called me and handed the phone to them. After arguing with the sales person I asked for the manager, though the manager was little help and said he would get back to me. Well 45 minutes later with my wife waiting they got back to me saying they would not cover the tire. It was so late that I couldn't go anywhere else and had to take the car on the trip next day and reluctantly bought 2 more tires at a "deal". I will never buy tires from Firestone again. The service was terrible, they made my wife wait for nearly 2 hours.]
