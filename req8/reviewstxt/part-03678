[116970110407987478275,100351621947963562036,I don't understand why there are so many negative reviews. Being a first time parent, it was overwhelming walking into the store. I wasn't sure where to start or what to get. Luckily, the staff was VERY helpful. They explained why I should consider buying certain items and everyone was friendly. The items might be a bit pricey, however, the that goes with the quality and uniqueness of the products.]
