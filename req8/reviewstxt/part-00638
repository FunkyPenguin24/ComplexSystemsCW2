[100062972730955263229,100192684007875231876,My boyfriend and I stayed at the Jesse Harlow House this past weekend. I chose to make my reservation here due to the friendliness and caring that Kathy showed during my initial phone call to get a quote on pricing. I had called many other locations and she was the only one I talked to that wanted to have a conversation instead of generically giving me numbers. Upon arrival she welcomed us in at the door and showed us around the house. When she said make yourself at home she meant it. She leaves you full range of the K-cup coffee and tea, provides cold drinks in the afternoon (homemade lemonade!), has a tray of snacks (brownies and baked goods), and even has a fridge with wine and beer – making sure you know it’s all up for grabs. The rooms were very clean and well kept. The breakfasts were not what you would call "traditional" such as eggs and bacon but were interesting (in a good way) and tasty. For example, the first day included grapefruit with toasted coconut, blueberry pancakes, sausage, and a salad (with candied nuts and cranberries). I would definitely stay here again and would recommend staying here to anyone who asked.]
