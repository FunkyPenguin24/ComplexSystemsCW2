[105553641014463506321,100831481491535252720,Just finished my first commute to work in my new 2013 Passat TDI, and got 50 mpg! I can't say enough how pleasant the buying experience was. Non confrontational and very straight forward. If they said it, they did it. I give my highest recommendation to Brian in sales and Luis in the business office. Both are a credit to VW and to Fitzgerald. Thanks again.]
