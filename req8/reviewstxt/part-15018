[108100320144312726414,100968003831643035589,This place sucks. Nothing ever works. Only place in the area with the card reader, and it never works. Went today. First stall wouldn't take my card info. Tried two cards. Moved to another stall, started the sprayer on wheel cleaner, nothing but air came out. The drive through hasn't worked in forever. Wish someone would fix it up. Could be a nice place.]
