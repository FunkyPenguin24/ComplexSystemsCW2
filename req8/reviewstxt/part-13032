[104200714937735157453,100858715735048885343,Overall it was good. On the backend there were a few problems with following through on making sure plastic was put down prior to unloading everything in the house. Caused a little delay in unloading but overall it was a good experience & would probably use them again. Their pricing was definitely better than the other companies we got quotes from & feel we got a fair deal for the money spent.]
