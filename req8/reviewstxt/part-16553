[112873489030836415500,101050041094923868958,I've lived here for a year and a half and have had nothing but a great experience here. The property is regularly maintained and clean, the office staff is friendly and helpful, and the maintenance usually comes within 24 hours of requesting. My wife and I recently had a baby, and when we asked to be upgraded to a 2 bedroom, the leasing office was very helpful, friendly, and accommodating. It's located across the street from the Town Center, so many stores and restaurants are within walking distance. There's 3 swimming pools and jacuzzis, one pool is heated year round. The gym was recently upgraded with some high end equipment. I've lived at about 6 different apartment complexes around Orange County in the past 5 years, and this place has by far been the nicest, cleanest, with the most helpful staff. I would recommend City Lights to anyone looking to move to Aliso.]
