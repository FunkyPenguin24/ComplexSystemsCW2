[106703026329523671028,100535003134718083014,Judy and Dori create absolutely beautiful arrangements; I have delivered for them several times and every time I am impressed with the quality of the flowers and the artistry of the bouquet. (I usually exclaim "Oooo, pretty!" when I pick them up.) The flowers also last well. They make every effort to confirm deliveries speedily, so if you order from out of town, you know when your flowers were delivered, and they always maintain a very courteous and professional demeanor, even with cross customers. I will always order flowers from Heaven Essence for people in the Boise area!]
