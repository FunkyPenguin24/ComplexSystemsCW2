[106013280780429274206,101122999185814966735,We've been in the neighborhood for more than 12-years and been using Riverside Animal Hospital that entire time. When we first started going there is was specifically to see Dr. Steven Kasanofsky, although there was at least one other vet there. Dr. K was well know and well liked - and we agreed with the referral. Over the years the practice has expanded and even though we don't see Dr. K as often, we've been quite pleased with the other vets that have been added to the practice. Everyone there has been terrific, especially in difficult times. I can't see bringing my dogs anywhere else.]
