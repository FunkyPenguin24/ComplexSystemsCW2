[108520943854649350035,100832642582312477344,I strongly suggest you not to stay!!!! I don't even want to give them one star. We got fool by the bright and clean lobby, thought it's pretty valuable price for RM118 a night on weekend, but we instantly regret when we get into the room, it has a very humid smell, and there are few hair on the bed, sheet and blanket are very ole and disrepair, we found one small cockroach on the wall, but there were even more in the bathroom, really disgusted. We told the receptionist the condition of the room, he was nicely say he will check the room and replace a room for us, then let us wait at lobby for 20 mins, long story short, after been pushed like a ball, we finally got out refund, before we left, the manager said this to me. "The cockroach problem is nature, we can't do anything about it, you go see any hotel on this street, it's all the same." I don't even want to respond him, if I do I just wanna slap on his face. After that we went to another hotel just next door called " Classic Inn", RM 168 per night on weekend including breakfast, this hotel is AMAZING!!!! Just pay RM 50 extra more and you got 500% better of everything. I wish I didn't try to save that money, totally not worth it:(]
