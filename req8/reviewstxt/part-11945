[100799404669226131295,100798034152186622909,Sin City is a beautiful store. They have a huge selection of wine, liquor, and other stuff. The owner suggested a pre-made frozen drink that was DELICIOUS! I also liked their cigar selection. I was pleasantly surprised to find a Romeo & Julieta Cigar there. The staff was super friendly and the overall feel of the store is inviting. I would definitely recommend Sin City to my friends and family. Oh, and I also like the name! Very cool!]
