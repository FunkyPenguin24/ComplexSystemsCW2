[106291940255435853451,100753918944347749618,I've attempted to register for a session for several days now. The website only gives an error message when trying to select classes and if you call, you either get transferred from person to person until a voice mail comes up that does not let you leave a message or the phone just rings and rings and no one answers. I've tried emailing as well with no response. If you truly want business professionals to enroll...the registration must be simple.]
