[107298597156219384245,100713995316267150603,My daughters have been going to Eastside orthodontics for many years and the staff always welcomes us like old friends. I am confident that their smiles will be our reward for all the time invested. The cookies and coffee are an added bonus while we wait as are children are being worked on. My daughter adds ,"I love the friendly staff and I just got my braces off and I have a beautiful smile now.They also have yummy cookies while you wait and hot chocolate in the winter months which is still good in South Florida:)]
