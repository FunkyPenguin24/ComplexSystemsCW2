[111279248452445972627,101170701263638882378,Amazing experience. We live in the area and chose Eye to Eye because it was close to home and accepted VSP. What a pleasant surprise. There was no waiting at appointment time. They saw my husband, son and myself. Super friendly office. Very helpful and extremely knowledgeable when trying to pick out our frames and lenses. We will recommend them to our friends without a doubt. Tina]
