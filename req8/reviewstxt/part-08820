[116694347347866698933,100628809978532246097,I walked in expecting to be disappointed, but Scott Cook was awesome. He helped me get through a roadblock to get a phone again. (mine was damaged beyond repair) It seems very rare these days that someone sees the situation you are in and will go the extra mile to help you get it resolved without you kicking and screaming. Thank you Scott for doing your job above and beyond my expectations.]
