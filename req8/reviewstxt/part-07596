[101877456067280493375,100565303258440388084,I didn't buy my car from there, just went there for check-up and service on November 1st, 2013. The person was welcoming and that was pretty much it. When they told me that the car was ready, I walked back in the office to talk to the person behind the counter, and find out about my car, but he didn't say anything than:"Just go to the cashier", and I was like okay so everything is good with the car, he said:" Yeah just go over there to the cashier", I was like okay. Went to the cashier, and they had a receipt for me, saying they changed the oil. I asked what oil did they use, he said we can't provide you with that info. I was like WHAT? I was not told that my oil needs to be changed in the first place, so you guys changed it anyway with the YOU CANT SAY type of oil. Then i looked at the paper that indicates where my car stands (green or red blocks) but nothing was marked. I told him what is this, nothing is marked. He called one of the workers to check it out, and that person said:"oh sorry i didnt have time to mark everything, but your car is in the green." I was like WOW really, you took forever, you didnt have time to tell me anything, you wanted me to pay for oil that i have no idea what kind it was, and now you give me a receipt that has nothing marked and tell me its good. Then i got the car, there was not even a sticker on the windshield or a piece of paper to tell me when is the next time to change the oil again. HORRIBLE SERVICE!]
