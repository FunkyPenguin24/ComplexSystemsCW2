[114648265214413815824,100336514003714778835,Beware, Just Brakes advertises one price but will try and upsale you. I was originally quoted $172 but later told I needed $2000 worth of work. I was told I needed their maintenance pkg even though it had been less than 2000 miles since I did Lube, oil, filter. I was told I needed rear axle seals even though they weren't leaking nor was the rear differential low on oil. I was told the calipers needed to be rebuilt, and the rotors needed to be replaced, none of which was needed. At one point they asked me what I was willing to spend to make the vehicle safe, I declined to answer. In the end I allowed them to replace 1 rotor (due to scoring) and machine the rest. When my daughter picked the car up they told her the rear axle seals needed to be replaced before the vehicle caught fire. These people are unbelievable, how do they sleep at night lying to people like that. DO NOT USE JUST BRAKES, they will rip you off.]
