[112712814375732329158,100596824519007338639,I love Mario's! There aren't very many good Mexican restaurant's around the West Garden Grove, Huntington Beach area. Mario's is the best and has the best Mexican food. Their margaritas are wonderful, and they serve you fast. ! My favorite is the enchilada with the green sauce. Yummy . Love those hot chips they make.]
