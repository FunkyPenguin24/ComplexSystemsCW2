[107646600736680610765,100369585099006760682,They deserve to have their franchise revoked. Horrendous customer service; Blatantly disrespectful. Ordered online (payed $35 with CC) - 1.5 hours later still no show. First Call - They tell me the driver is on his way Second Call (15 mins later) - They dont pick up 3rd Call (2 min later) - they put me on hold for 7 minutes and then hang up 4th - 11th calls - no answer Now I have to dispute the charge with my bank. I'll definitely be writing into corporate about this branch. People like this make me long for the days of outlaw justice.]
