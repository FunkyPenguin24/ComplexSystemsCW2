Bed is spacious enough for 4 persons and one kid. The room and toilet is very clean. Beach and coastal bazaar is walkable. It is not a big city to see the view. You can have a good relax and it has one nice swimming pool and gym as well. Cons: Breakfast is not served at free of cost. For parking charge is $8/- per day. But for the cheap price it is affordable.]
