[110329889057892166746,100265638659826987865,We used Azul for our engagement and wedding photos and we can't rave enough about how fabulous Christobal and his crew were! For our engagement shoot, he made the whole process very fun and the pictures came out great! But I must say, our wedding pictures were even more incredible! Christobal and his assistant, April, did an absolutely amazing job capturing every detail of our special day! Not only that, but they were very easy going, professional and FUN .. they really added to the excitement during what could be a very stressful time! I love re-living the big day by looking through our photos, and I know we will cherish these for a lifetime to come! My hubby and I would absolutely recommend Azul to any couple who is looking for the perfect wedding photographer, or for any other special event in your life. You won't regret it! :-)]
