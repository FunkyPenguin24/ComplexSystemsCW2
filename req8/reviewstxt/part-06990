[109392980131577241691,100532377301864377700,STAY AWAY! This pet store is fun until you actually purchase something. I bought a puppy and was assured that there was a 48 hour return policy wherein, in the case where the dog would not be a good fit within the first two days, I would receive my money back. I went into the store one day later, as my roommate and I were suffering from the breed's allergic affects, and I spoke with a manager and the owner. The manager claimed they could not refund my money AT ALL. After just 20 HOURS! I spoke with the owner and he brought up some loophole in the agreement I signed. The salesperson mislead me about the return policy and got me to sign the agreement under false knowledge. The owner was very impatient, and I am planning to pursue this with my lawyer. I was out $500 after one day and received no rebate for the puppy. Absolutely ridiculous. STAY AWAY FROM THIS STORE!]
