[110759012759133558289,100475735980050518001,Warning. I bought two pairs of circular needles from them a few weeks ago, my first time in this store. After I started my project I realized one pair was too large. I went to the store today to exchange for a smaller size and was told they do not exchange. I did not asks for a refund, only an exchange. The needles were in there original plastic baggie that had never even been opened. The saleswoman was very blunt. What an unethical business.]
