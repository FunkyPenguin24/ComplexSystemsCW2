[108484500382551977164,100110235856537804942,Ordered what was supposed to be steak with garlic prawns, steak was full of grizzle and was as tough has shoe leather. Our prawns turned into what were clearly shrimps in a greasy tasteless sauce. The table was sticky, staff just looked bored without any motivation will definitely not visit again. The worst meal I've had since school dinner days.]
