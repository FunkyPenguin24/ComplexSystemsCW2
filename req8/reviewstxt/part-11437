[101240577522848634432,100770460022774018111,Brought my car in for an oil change from the Groupon Brooks Huff ran recently. I've received great service! They discovered a burned out brake light and a nail in one of my tires. The waiting area is clean, and they even have a Keurig. A lot of mechanic shops are not pleasant places to wait-this is not one of those shops. I would definitely come back here, even if I wasn't using a Groupon. Tim and Eric provided me with great service-polite, friendly and prompt. Thank you!]
