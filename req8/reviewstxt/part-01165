[101295611781944503405,100219681594757169516,My family and I started going to Dr. Galligan when I moved to NC in 2007. Since that time, not one of us has had anything but an excellent experience. The practice is staffed with warm, and truly caring professionals who always know your name and ask about your family. It is white glove treatment from start to finish. I highly recommend Dr. Galligan's to anyone looking to be treated with kindness, compassion, and care.]
