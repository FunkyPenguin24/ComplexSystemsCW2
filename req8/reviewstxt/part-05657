[106653162377219440691,100459079250987505313,The folk at Stillinger's were beyond helpful. When my father died, our finances were very limited. Judy, Shawn, Jeannine and all the rest of the staff couldn't have been more compassionate in our time of need. Judy Fuller even went out of her way some weeks before my father's passing to help me through a number of legal documents to ensure that Dad had the best care and that his wishes were met. These are some truly wonderful people. They have even stuck with us for almost a year after Dad's funeral to help get his grave marker and other burial logistics handled with care. I will always be grateful to the good people at Stillinger's.]
