[110948138293276011087,100439140153607233268,I came to SF Custom Chiropractic two weeks before running a marathon for a knee injury that was making it very painful to walk, let alone run. I worked mainly with Dr. Gustin, who is awesome! He is very professional, yet also makes you feel relaxed and comfortable. He did a thorough evaluation and really got a sense for my pain and the real cause of it. Both Dr. Gustin and Dr. Jacobs laid out a treatment plan for me keeping in mind my goal of running the marathon and the time frame we had to work with. They did ART on my knee, calves, and hips and gave me some exercises to do on my own, which to my surprise made a huge difference (after actually doing them). After a week and a half of treatment and stretching on my own, the pain was pretty much gone and I was excited about running again. Iâ€™m so thankful to these two for being super knowledgeable in their field and really working with you on your specific goals.]
