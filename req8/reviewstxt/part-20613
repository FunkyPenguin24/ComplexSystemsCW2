The instructors are experienced, knowledgeable and great at relating to students. My oldest son has been attending classes at Denda Academy for 6 years and his confidence in himself and his athletic ability continue to grow. We also have 2 other children attending and they love it! Master Dutson/Denda Academy is the cream of the crop in regards to martial arts schools!]
