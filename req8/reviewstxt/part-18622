[115008108084131320400,101162449728963206462,Limited Selection of food, Not the greatest service, Didnt get my pickle spear like menu says and instead after I asked they brought a small cup of pickle slices, didnt get my side salad until I asked. So basically I was served a burger on a plate and they didnt see anything wrong. Just a shady place if you ask me. Plus some creepy guy kept staring at my woman. Wont be going back I can get that service and food from McDonalds.]
