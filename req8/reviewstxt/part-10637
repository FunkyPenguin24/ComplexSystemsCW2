[117772887297429544973,100728386707868344976,Very Bad, The staff was less interested in doing a good first exam/cleaning than to to try to set me up for an expensive deep cleaning procedure. A subsequent dental appointment I set up at Sunrise dental stated that this deep cleaning was wasteful and completely unnecessary. Furthermore, the exam here was the most painful I have ever endured at a dentist office.]
