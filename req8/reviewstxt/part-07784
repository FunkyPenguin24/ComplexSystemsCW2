[112386158106840795520,100576088393744093127,I went early in the am.... I found it to be very good, a bit costly. Overall, I would go back just for the latte' it was soo good..... I do not remember the floor being dirty. They are very busy, so they may need to hire someone for a few hours a day just to keep up with the demand of cleanliness.... :) I definitely would recommend this place!!!!]
