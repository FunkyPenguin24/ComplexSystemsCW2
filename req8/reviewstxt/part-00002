[111434051067000568193,100158991716568568396,I went to Thee Diner to get breakfast after taking care of an errand in the area. A quiet spot near a highschool. On stepping into the place I found it to be very clean semi filled with people from the Cicero area. My server was very polite and attentive. My food was brought to me in a reasonable amount of time. It was entertaining to listen to the regular patrons talk trash with the cook.]
