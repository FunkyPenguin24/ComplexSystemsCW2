[100466540394025300037,100289658000923335232,We went in for a viola mute, and although they didn't have one, the woman called 4 other music stores trying to find one for us! We were blown away by that and have committed that whenever we need something we'll be going to Danman's Music. We also have several family friends that send their kids to Danman's and have nothing but great things to say about their teaches - in vocal, guitar and piano.]
