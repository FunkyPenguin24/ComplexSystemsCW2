[112318607154647355273,100852296568776500183,I was in town to volunteer for a Blue Skies retreat on behalf of families dealing with pediatric cancer. I stopped here with several volunteer on our first night in town. The food was delicious! I noticed that a few (not all) of the servers struggled to provide service in good English, but if you have the right attitude, that can add to the charm and the fun. Later, these guys demonstrated their commitment to their community by donating 100 servings of rice, beans, chips, and salsa for our guest and volunteer families to enjoy one night. I was very moved by this generosity and will support them as a customer whenever I am back!]
