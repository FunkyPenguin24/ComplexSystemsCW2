[101099267359949117997,101156702553738661721,I went paragliding off Signal with Fly Cape Town Paragliding. Even though I'd been once before I was still pretty nervous, and secretly hoping that the mist I saw would prevent the flight! No such luck, and we went ahead when the mist cleared. It was a marvelous experience, I flew with Grant and after 2 steps running along Signal Hill we were airborne. We spent 10 minutes riding the thermals along Signal Hill, which presented plenty of opportunity for photos of other paragliders, the city below stretching out to the sea and Signal Hill. We then headed down to Sea Point to land on the frass. Grant helped take an awesome video with his GoPro camera. I thoroughly recommend this experience, and commend Fly Cape Town Paragliding for their professionalism.]
