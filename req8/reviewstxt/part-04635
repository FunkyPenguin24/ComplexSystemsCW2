[104833217940752088498,100406263323940532058,I loved the food lots of everything. 1 question though, why would you go to a seafood restaurant and order a steak?!?! All I have to say is... I Love CORKYBELLS!!! WHERE SEAFOOD LOVERS, LOVE THEY'RE SEAFOOD! No beef eaters need apply. Start simple with some great fried pickles, and some fried mushrooms. Then work ya way into their famous fried shrimp. Don't forget about that gator tail now! Try not to eat it all though, save some for the rest of us Florida Crackers! Love you Corkybells, keep it up yur doin' fine!!!!! I <3 shrimp!]
