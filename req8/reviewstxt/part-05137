[103807179247224648696,100430511419377025419,Best sushi in Brisbane, and my favourite place for a quick affordable lunch. The focus here is on the fresh ingredients - no overwhelmingly sickly sweet rice or overpowering rice wine or sauces. In fact I reckon its the freshest yummiest sushi in Brisbane. They can get busy over lunch but takeaway sushi is quick to order and grab on the go even during the busy periods. After 1pm you need to order sushi in lots of two, and they make them to order, but this means made-on-the-spot yumminess, and the kitchen is usually very quick. Definitely worth a visit.]
