[104580544239110211168,100568999386457793285,Very unprofessional company in my opinion. Took our order and deposit, only to refuse the job when we asked them to guarantee their work. A search of the Province's court database shows more than 220 cases involving this company in the last 15 years. Our firm decided based on this to take strong action against them. Be cautious when you deal with these people. They wasted 2 months of time and business to our store was certainly damaged as a result of their sales person agreeing to things he had no authority to agree to. Do your due diligence.]
