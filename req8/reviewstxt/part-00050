[113845608652642381077,100161591760552224035,Once again, Brandon Paluszak at Ehrlich Nissan in Greeley came through for me and my new truck purchase. Brandon always greets you with a smile and never hesitates to go to bat for you and get you the deal that works best for you, not just the dealership. Other members of Ehrlich are great as well. Always helpful and greets you with a smile. If you want a no hassle car or truck purchase, go to Ehrlich and don't waste your time anywhere else. Thanks Brandon - I will see you again soon!]
