[100337897220526531686,100770581179431543601,I will start by saying that I like living in Park Lafayette. My boyfriend and I are planning on staying here for a few years, because we loved the amenities, view, location, and felt very secure. I also enjoyed the mix of residents that were young professionals and empty nesters, and that it's pet friendly. I've never experienced any fire alarms going out in the middle of the night, nor have I ever heard any of my neighbors through the wall, and I have never had to wait for a workout machine in the gym.]
