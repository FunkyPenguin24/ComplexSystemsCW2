[117418924900901896995,100801037844702865007,I bought an old car without taking it to a mechanic first thinking I would risk it and possibly save some money. I took it to two mechanics and found they had different stories about what was wrong with it and what they would fix. I didn't feel comfortable with either of them. Their explanations didn't seem to make sense. Their offices were busy and crowded and the employees seemed frantic and over-worked. We took the car here and I am so glad we did! Our appointment was honored. The space was clean and calm. Ryan lifted up the car and showed us everything that was wrong and explained to us what needed to be fixed right away and what didn't. That made all the difference. The car runs like a dream and I trust I received quality service and that the car will run for years longer because of them.]
