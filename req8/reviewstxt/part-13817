[107508783240187608612,100901442605183785161,Brought my 2010 Impreza in for a routine oil change and tire rotation. The service team informed me my brakes and rotors were worn out, and needed replacing. They took care of the brakes a couple days later, and offered me a courtesy shuttle to and from a nearby coffee shop while I waited. Both procedures took a bit longer than I expected, but my service consultant, David, was nice enough to apply a 10% discount coupon at both appointments--a huge help, especially for the brakes/rotors, which weren't cheap. All in all, the staff were polite, knowledgeable, and professional, and more than made up for any delays. As for the car: it's running great!]
