[114156215229323485288,100590069666569100423,This is a true working farm. Gigantic Pigs, chickens, you name it. I'm from Brooklyn so just seeing all these animals cohabitating was pretty impressive but then they sell they're own meat, cure the sausage and the bacon and plus sell the most delicious prepared foodâ€”it is the BEST. I am particularly obsessed with the biscotti, quiche and bacon. But everything is delicious and the farmers are the hardest working, yet most chill people I've ever met. Stop by and stock up. Tell Sarah and Craig that I sent you.]
