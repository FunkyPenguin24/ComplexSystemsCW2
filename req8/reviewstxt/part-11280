[110388270955492825535,100762778122852238993,After dining in and ordering a salad and a regular slice I thought the place deserved a second visit. So on my second trip there I ordered a large Hungry Sasquatch (Pie with the works.) Which was actually pretty decent. The toppings were plentiful, the ingredients were fresh and the pie was cooked through without a burnt bottom. I was pleased with the size of the large as well. I also ordered a plain Sicilian pizza. Now growing up on Long Island in New York, I've always knew Sicilian pies to be a square pie cut into squares, with a lot of olive oil and sauce that drips down your arm while you eat it with the obvious chucks of tomatoes through out. I was super surprised and almost insulted to find that this Sicilian was cut into shapes that a normal pie would be cut into. The end result being a square pie with really odd triangle like shapes for slices...(I wish I could upload pictures here for you guys. It was quite a sight.) The dough was super thick almost like a bread stick and very dry. Very little sauce and not one drop of olive oil anywhere. I was actually rather amused and fairly confused by this Sicilian. I mean a simple image search on google will show you that a Sicilian pie is supposed to be cut into squares. I just found this lack of knowledge alarming and almost comical. The beer selection however is plentiful, the regular and specialty pies are decent but the Sicilian was an absolute joke. Not only was it cut wrong and dry, they didn't insert any pizza tables into the boxes to keep the cheese from sticking to the top of the boxes. I mean the mistakes they made are, I think, an insult to pizza 101. So all in all I give the place 3 stars. Staff was friendly and the place was clean from what I could see. A nice place to stop in for lunch and get a slice and a pint, but that's about it. A+ for effort.]
