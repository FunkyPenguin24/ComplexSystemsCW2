It's very reasonably priced, and there is plenty of parking in the garage. They validate parking, and if you are there for dinner and a movie you only end up paying about $2 for parking. I've rarely been to a movie that was more than half full so you are always able to get good seats. The seats are large and comfortable. There is about a foot between each seat so you have plenty of room and don't feel like the person next to you is breathing down your neck. They have a full menu and bar that is reasonably priced.]
