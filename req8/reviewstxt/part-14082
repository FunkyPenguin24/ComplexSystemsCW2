[110224377611104947205,100916123365547608295,I would like to say that Flagship is a Five Star company with Five Star service. I would like to say that on August 11, 2013 Flagship did more than accommodate me because of my disabilities they made my experience a unforgettable one that I will never forget. They are the dream come true. Flagship was the keystone of my trip to San Diego if I wouldn't have taken that prime rib cruse on the last night of my trip I would of missed out on something so special. If there was any tears shed it would be of tears of JOY and I never wanted the night to end. If you were wondering how they accommodated me is since I couldn't eat certain foods they on the fly substituted them with something else like the salad they gave me a fruit plate and made it on the spot and they made shore I had access to a wheelchair restroom. You couldn't ask for better service than what they offered me. After the cruise was over the caption made shore that my ride service came by to pick me up and I was safe. Whether you are or not disabled you won't go wrong booking on Flagship. Again a Big Thank You from the bottom of my heart Flagship and I hope to be on your cruise ship the California Spirit.]
