[103541280630470123925,100576465354628857568,Odd shop.. Expensive which is ok if they are knowledgeable.. Unfortunately these guys did not know a thing about LiPo Batteries, even basic questions.. I am always happy to pay over Internet prices to keep a local shop open, so I jumped down the road to HobbyTown in Sunnyvale, much more friendly staff and happy to share expertise.. Way less expensive too! Such a shame...]
