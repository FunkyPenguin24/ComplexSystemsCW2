[101843115353194620919,100837865036173169577,A jewelry store that helps me find something in my price range. I've recently purchased two items from Carreras, both for my lovely wife. Found a beautiful teardrop necklace that was very reasonably priced as a surprise anniversary gift (after we said no gifts!). For Christmas, since I'm not the best jewelery shopper I purchased a Gift Certificate on-line and used as a stocking stuffer. There are certificates available in a variety of price ranges and it was a very simple process. For those guys who always seem to buy the wrong jewelry, the gift certificate is a great way to go.]
