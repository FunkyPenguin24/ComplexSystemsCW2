[108375536461701844984,100053910175880301903,I will have to agree with all the parents that love Seal North Pinellas! My son is 2 years old and had private lessons prior to going to Seal. He has been in Seal since March and I have recommend them to several other parents who also have now joined Seal. Everyone is super nice and very well trained. My son cried a lot in the beginning, (more for show) then anything, but even with the tears, Ms. Lindsey was getting him to actually "swim" and be able to know to get the wall if he fell in the water. He now loves going and looks forward to his classes. They are busy because they are seasonal, but while you there everyone from the front desk to the instructors in the pool are very professional and friendly.]
