[102204623880644892497,101177404887075768925,Was looking online at vehicles because I just got rid of my Ford F150 and was going to purchase a car and seen a 2009 Ford F150 that caught my eye and really thought it was out of my price range. But after talking to Emily and Jason they hooked us up with the payment we wanted and was out the door the same day. Depaula was the best buying experience I ever had and would recommend them to anyone. A great atmosphere, awesome prices, friendly faces, we will be coming back to them in 6 months for another vehicle!!]
