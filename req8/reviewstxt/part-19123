[102075306453099562943,100012149167123852418,I went to this place because of all the positive reviews. Im not really sure how this place has good reviews. The shop is like a dusty, dirty tourist trap. This was my first tattoo and I was already very nervous. By the end of the session when I look at my arm I felt sick I mean even from a distance you can see that my lines are extremely jagged in almost every place. also this dude obviously has no skill in relation to shading. idk how to even explain how simple shading could be so uneven and messy. ugh. im super dissatisfied especially for the price which was 150 which is near the same as black cat tattoo ( a shop a friend recommended i go to after the fact :[ ) would charge. now i just have to spend another 100 to get it this shit fixed. I cant remember the artists name but he seemed not totally confident in his work. and he was super impressed with what he did to my arm which makes me curious what his other tattoos look like.]
