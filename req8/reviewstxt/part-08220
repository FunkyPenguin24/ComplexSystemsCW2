[112581651327058022854,100599547549386214786,Shaddy Oaks has been boarding & grooming my dogs for over 9 years. I even call them before I call the vet on health issues. 6 years ago we adopted one of their dogs that came off the show circuit and he has turned out to be the greatest dog ever. My grand kids can do anything to that dog! They even share the dog toys! If you want to leave your dogs with folks that really know dogs and care about them this is the place.]
