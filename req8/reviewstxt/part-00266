[112448293881885353630,100173176293710163961,I was pretty sure that I wanted a MINI when I walked into South Bay but the whole experience of getting my little red car was more satisfying and fun than anticipated. I worked with Ash who is warm, friendly and courteous. I felt no pressure to buy and he made me laugh - sending me pictures of my "gorgeous" red mini after I test drove it. (I was torn between red and pepper white and he was trying to help me decide). Ash even brought the car to me at work so I could see the sunroof and the color red in bright daylight which helped me make key decisions about my MINI. The facilities are great, too and the VIP program is the best - with free car washes on a drive-in basis - That matters in LA. The finance person I worked with was also very good and patiently helped me choose among the extended warranty options without pressure. Altogether, I was treated like a valued customer from start to finish when I drove off. And, I now look forward to driving just about anywhere because the MINI handles well and is a really fun car to drive. Thanks to all the good people I worked with at South Bay.]
