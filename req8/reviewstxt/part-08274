From the first moment I spoke with the receptionist to get set up on the 30 day trial to my first moments in class, it was always such a positive experience. The staff at Good Vibes are so welcoming (even first thing in the morning!) and the instructors are exceptionally trained in their field so you really get results. And classes are always different so you don't get bored of the same old routine. Working in Central London, I love having 2 studios in close proximity to choose from – it’s so nice to be able to escape the office for a lunchtime yoga, powerplates or spinning class. I feel Good Vibes work with their clients to create a schedule that works and are constantly adding other classes (and upgrading the studios) so we can get the best options. The online schedule and booking option is also very convenient and easy to use. I highly recommend Good Vibes!!]
