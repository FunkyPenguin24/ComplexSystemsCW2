[117445293757810592465,100469997108860367341,Hi, I'm a top producing Real Estate agent with RE/MAX here in Calgary. I work with Real Estate lawyers on a daily basis, and frankly, THIS IS BY FAR THE WORST LAW OFFICE I HAVE EVER WORKED WITH! Please learn from my clients' mistakes, and DO NOT WORK WITH THEM. It's shocking how a such an unprofessional, unorganized law office is still in business today. Through the course of a month in dealing with them, the paralegals have MISPLACED OUR FILE, never called me back (after many many calls), the receptionist HUNG UP ON ME, they've lost documents, sent the wrong documents, and failed to complete the necessary work by possession, and NOW WE CANNOT CLOSE ON TIME!! Please learn from our mistakes, do your research and DO NOT LET THIS COMPANY HANDLE YOUR BIGGEST ASSET!! I'd be happy to explain our experience to anyone who is interested. I feel like this entire company is ran by crooks, and I'd hate for someone to share the same struggle that we've been through. -Caleb Reich]
