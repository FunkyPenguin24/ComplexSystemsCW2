[104260862411587344630,100213867877001890448,Located right by Termini Station, the location can't be beat. After discovering (later) that Italy generally doesn't accept Euro Traveler's cheques - Hotel Chicago did. The friendly hotel staff allowed me to use their computer. The room was well kept and the decor was nice, location was quiet. Breakfast was brought to your room in the morning and included juice, buns, jam and toast. Milk, coffee and tea available as well if desired. The breakfast wasn't incredibly filling as compared to other continental breakfasts, but it did fill a space. The Free Wifi didn't have the strongest signal and I needed to stay by the window for the best signal, which was a nuisance. I would stay here again, but this was my first time in Rome so I have no other comparison in this city, but I have traveled before.]
