[103773371619030406118,100681544162008681910,I usually avoid the dentist, but after months of having issues with a tooth, I decided to bite the bullet. I wasn't in excruciating pain but the tooth ended up needing a root canal because half of it was missing due to cavity decay :/ . Let me just explain how awesome this service was: 9:00 i called to make an appointment 10:30 They had an opening and scheduled me. by 1PM they had already drilled the root canal and put on the crown, They were very good about asking me about my pain level during the procedure and because of that feedback he was able to numb the area's that still hurt. I didn't feel anything after this, and the root canal was way easier than i thought. I've heard countless horror stories from family and friends about how much it hurt etc. Thankfully, I chose the right dentist. I'll be using this dentist for as long as I live in the area.]
