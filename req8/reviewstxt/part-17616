[115780738955873801532,101109561761235813611,I have been letting from Martin & Co for over a year and have received an excellent level of support from all the staff. The rental process was quick and efficient and all my subsequent enquiries have been dealt with promptly. On one occasion, where I thought there was something wrong with the gas boiler, the maintenance engineer described how to correct the problem over the phone. Which was very informative and saved a lot of time.]
