[101761536750116033587,101122986804525302302,I went here the other day and was pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh and tasty and the bubble drink (which are hard to find in Tallahassee) was really good. The service was pleasant - I never had to ask for a refill and never felt rushed or uncared for. If I had read the other reviews first, I would not have gone here. That being said, I had a very nice experience. Maybe my experience was a fluke, but if they provide that level of service consistently, it is definitely one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Tallahassee. I'll update the review after eating there again.]
