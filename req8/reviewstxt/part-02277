[115923946190936331105,100276364213370031822,I had to cut my own hair after getting home. My bangs were cut almost two inches too short and at an angle, and the rest of my layers just look chopped off. The girl just said, "Oops! That's shorter than you wanted. Hope your hair grows fast!" Took an hour just for a wash and trim. Going somewhere else to have it fixed tomorrow.]
