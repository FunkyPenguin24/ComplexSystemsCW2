[114134967382377439793,100028053201966837009,Mully's offers flavorful southern favorites both deep fried and baked. The buffet is sure to please. I enjoy the mac n cheese. All the fried meats are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Food is full of flavor but not overpowered by seasonings. I even tried the stuffed crab and it was great. The lemonade must be fresh squeezed. It is some of the best lemonade I have had. The price of the dinner buffet is about $8.99 and is well worth it.]
