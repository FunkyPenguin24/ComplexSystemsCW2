[116837004286430857926,100450452748393531188,I've had two tattoos done here (at least, so far). The first one, done a couple of months ago, was simple, an addition to an existing one that turned it from "ok" to fabulous! The second one, finished barely a week ago, is absolutely breathtaking. I am SO looking forward to showing it off once it finishes healing. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone. They are professional, thorough, and do beautiful work. Trust me, you will be glad you came here. This is THE place to go.]
