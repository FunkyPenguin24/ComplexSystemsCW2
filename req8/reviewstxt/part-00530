[107787285066625778748,100186549083958687031,Delivered our first baby at Bethesda North. The labor and delivery nurses were fantastic and the care we received after delivery was top notch. They were super supportive of our birth plan for a natural delivery. In the end I had an unexpected C-section and stayed in the hospital for 4 days. The doctors and nurses really took great care of us. The lactation consultant also was a great help to getting my baby and I off on a good foot with breast feeding. A+ care!!]
