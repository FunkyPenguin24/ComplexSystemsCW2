[100102781935777871082,100557451161674433638,Awesome, chilled bikers! Rented a little Duke from these guys while visiting Bangalore and they were ace. Everyone warned me not to ride in India because I wouldn't cope with the roads or the rental shop would invent bike damage or a bunch of other nonsense. These guys are straight up, no-bs, bikers full of good practical advice, decent bikes, a greasy bike garage and an honest business approach. Prices are transparent and fair. They even let me have a play with one of the Enfields. What more could I have wanted?]
