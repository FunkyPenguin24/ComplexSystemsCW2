[110157893664383477876,100676822342178219612,This was not our first visit to Intermountain Hospital and it wont be our last . They care for both , our little friend and us . It is rare today to find a business that puts caring ahead of money -- they do . They have gone out of their way time after time to make us feel a part of "the team" in caring for the health of our pet . Saved his life by alerting us to a hidden health problem we didn't see --- He is fine today because of the diagnostic skill of Dr. "K" and not a day goes by that we don't think of the "what if" and we could of lost a valued part of our life .]
