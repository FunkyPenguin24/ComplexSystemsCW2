[111075864146206860649,100020039563026219834,I ABSOLUTELY love this office!! They are very precise, accurate, caring, knowledgeable and gentle. I have had nothing but good experiences here and we all know how scary going to the dentist can be......from the front office staff to the hygienist's, to the assistants and to the doctors...everyone is kind, caring and compassionate. I would not take my family any where else and I HIGHLY recommend this office to anyone! Thank you to my all my different hygienists, doctor assistants and a special shout out to Dr. Skip Jeranko for your hard work and the amazing work you did on my smile :) All of the doctors here, Dr. Skip Jeranko, Dr. Jeffrey Stang, Dr. Hadley Thurmon and Dr. Anthony Lere are AMAZING and really know what their doing!!!!]
