They did everything in their power to make me not hurt, and to make me not scared. I am clinically fearful of the dentist. I am squirming in my seat just thinking about the procedure, as I bite down on my gauze. Bottom Line: This is the best dentist I have ever been to. You will be treated fairly, and with true compassion for any fears you may have. A+++]
