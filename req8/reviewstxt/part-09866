[109926144717985421673,100685962902600105784,I was suffering from extreme pain, inability to sleep, to work, take care of my family after having a car accident last November. Not only did Dr. Baker see to it that my kids who were in the car with me and I experience a full recovery, he was completely flexible in accommodating my schedule, even on occasion providing treatment at my office. My treatment didn't cost me a dime and Dr. Baker worked with my insurance company so that I am even being compensated for time I missed at work. I highly, highly recommend Dr. Baker.]
