[100954632220685250221,100541914354020046210,Spent time looking for the first car for a 17 year old. We found several that were at All Star, researched the value and were prepared to buy. WE HAD CASH IN HAND. A man by the name of DINO come out to help us. He asked who the car was for and I stated a teenager...first car...He looked at me and said "I have been in the business 20 years and if I want to stay in this business 20, I don't work with teenagers. Hmm...We had cash in hand...we were prepared to purchase a vehicle. He walked away. looking at us but refusing to help us. This upset the teenager. Why because of his age should he not be helped? We walked away...We drove a good distance to look and purchase. NEVER BUY FROM HERE! THEY ARE UNPROFESSIONAL, at least this man was. They lost out and will never get our business.]
