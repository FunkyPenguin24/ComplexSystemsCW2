[105355650311329268426,101080255069538845519,I find the negative comments humorous regarding The Breakers being ostentatious a gaudy. The old, "idle rich" complaint. If you do a little investigation online, you should know what you are in for. If you think the preservation people are snobs, I suggest you buy a huge old mansion with staggering upkeep and maintenance costs, and run it how you think you should! I think they have done wonders with properties that are simply amazing. For me, I was intrigued with what I read online. The tour did not disappoint. An indoor tour during the winter meant no lines to wait in, and unobstructed views of the exterior. Taking pictures outside without people in the shots was a big plus to me. A very good use of a sunny, winter day. It was sure a lot better than staying in my hotel! A business trip brought me to the area in February, and having a weekend on my hands, I decided to explore the "Cliff Walk". It was excellent. It only confirmed my interest in seeing the mansion up-close. I spent an hour taking pictures outside. I was disappointed to not be allowed to take pictures inside - but I knew that going in. I purchased the winter season pass, which will allow me to go back and tour two other properties. I hear "The Elms" is the best tour. I also want to see Marble House. $25 well spent, as I said, on a winter's day (or three, in my case).]
