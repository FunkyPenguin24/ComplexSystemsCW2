[115674659867265995218,100904827127586172068,Been shopping and eating there for a while and tonight was the last straw. 8 o'clock and they are cleaning up everything while people are ordering food. Sweeping all around my feet leaving the swept garbage for us to stand on in front of the register. I was served a quesadilla with al pastor meat. when I went for my first bite the meat I encountered was hard and tough that their useless plastic forks could not even separate. It was gross. I gave it back to them at the counter and let them know in good spanish what a pig pen they were serving food to people. Not shopping there anymore on that account.]
