I very much appreciated the paper booties he put over his shoes to keep from tracking dirt into our home. After thoroughly checking both HVAC systems, he informed me of some issues with one of the systems that would require replacement/repair, to include showing me images on his iPad. His explanation of the problems was clear and thorough. I was very satisfied at the end of this service calll.]
