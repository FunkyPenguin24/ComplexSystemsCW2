[110563082104763737981,100490447903239199671,Me and my mother were going to see a performance of Les Mis and set about Google-ing the best restaurants within walking distance of Shaftesbury avenue. Well I happened to stumble across this one and what luck, it was better than either of us could have imagined. I'll admit that we were worried due a few bad reviews but I'm so so glad that we stuck with it. The staff were extremely friendly and attentive, glasses were always full. I will recommend the salmon starter, although all the food was heavenly. The best meal I have ever had, genuinely. The bathroom was stunning although extremely hot for some reason. Go. Soon. You won't regret it, a beautiful evening of class and fine dining.]
