[101194871170060833935,100406306158989598449,I am originally from the northwest ohio area and I have moved from there to maryland and to columbus. And every time I come back to visit family I get a tattoo from Tony touch. His schedule is almost never open but I make sure I get my appointment at least 2 months in advance. He's a busy guy. I understand that. His work is super awesome and I plan on getting many more tattoos from him in the future. On top of that I have never spent more than $200 for a tattoo with him. Not that I get huge back peices or anything. But I do get medium sized tattoos, around 9x5 I would say. I suppose it depends on the job. I do agree with the review that says that the girl at the front desk is not very nice but don't let that deter you from the shop. Also if you come in and you know that artist is there, they might be willing to see you and give you a quote.]
