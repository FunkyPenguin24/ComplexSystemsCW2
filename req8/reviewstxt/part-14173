[108641871051974903971,100921716161617967497,I expected the price to be lower, but am still glad that I found what I was looking for. Some reviewers write that the same part can be found at autozone or advance autoparts, which can be true for certain parts. In my case I couldn't find it (a steering knuckle for a 98 2wd Tahoe) in the stores. Would definitely buy from them again.]
