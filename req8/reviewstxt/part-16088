[113209140482765618083,101025630492739370915,This beautiful spa was the perfect spot for my recent visit to Houston. The moment I walked in I was greeted by my masseuse with a bottle of water and wonderfully relaxing music. The name Zen really describes what I felt once my massage began and she was very thoughtful about asking me about specific pressures and spots of tension. I also chose to use the sauna and they prescribed a wonderful combination of aromatherapy. I can't wait to try the cupping on my next visit. Thank you for a rejuvenating time! I will definitely use this as my "go to paradise" when visiting Houston.]
