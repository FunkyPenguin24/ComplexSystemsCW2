[113863548082518173680,101044062485846109869,I have been going to Dr. Bryan for quite a few years and his treatments of my ailments have never failed to help my pain. I call him the "Gentle Giant" because of his height and gentle demeanor with his patients. He's vey personable and down-to-earth. I would recommend him to anyone.]
