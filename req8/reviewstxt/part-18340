[100979570773579418197,101147649768885040689,I had a leaking tire so I read all the reviews before I gave this place a try. I didn't have an appointment but they were able to get me in around an hour which I really appreciated. The owner is friendly and a real jokester. I had two kids with me under the age of 4 so staying in a car shop for a long time was not what I was looking forward to. They got me out ASAP and the bill was under $25. I would go back for other car needs, I feel they can be trusted and that's really important for me with car repair.]
