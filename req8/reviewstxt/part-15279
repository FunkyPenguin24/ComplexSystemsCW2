[107872527669347338394,100981208581095936096,The service was pretty quick. They went through a pretty exhaustive list of things that I should have done while there. This is an older car so I was not surprised but I was in a hurry and declined the many suggestions. Shortly after this service I noticed that I was leaving oil spots on my newly resurfaced driveway. On climbing under the car I found several of the bolts on the oil pan were loose and one was completely missing. Perhaps a coincidence, but it seems that with all of the other 'observations' they made, they should have seen the missing bolt. A habit of just running a finger around the pan or a quick visual would leave the impression of looking out for not only their interests but also _genuinely_ for mine. A quick mention or note on the paper work "We checked the bolts on your oil pan and found that they were tight." Or 'they were a bit loose so we snugged them up" etc. Regardless, I don't think I will be going back there.]
