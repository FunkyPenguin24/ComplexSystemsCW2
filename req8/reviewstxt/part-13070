[113765246556097255479,100860791409574603826,I LOVE LOVE LOVE this restaurant! I got the soup, salad, and sandwich combo, which was both delicious and a great deal at $9.95. I selected a whole BLT with a side of garlic aioli (yum!), a salad with veggies and ranch, and for my soup I mixed tomato and clam chowder. The sandwich was perfection, the soups are always great, and our server was very friendly, helpful and attentive. Not only will I be back, I will be bringing friends!]
