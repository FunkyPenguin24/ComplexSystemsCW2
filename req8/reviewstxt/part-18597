[100325269088654961394,101161291832655175187,Buyers beware!!!!! I bought 2 new expensive bmx bikes for my sons and one of them was used. Didnt see all of the scratches and paint chips in the store. Was able to see all of the minor damage to the one bike in the sun after I took it out of my vehicle. Unfortunately I called and talked to the owner as well as talked to him in person. Im not sure why he is even at his own business. I had way more knowledge as far as the questions I asked about upgrades on both bikes, and had more business and social skills than this guy!!! He was very rude and questioned why I wanted a new bike at new bike prices.....? My question to him was why would you buy a used car at new car prices????? Im only rating this review so low on behalf of the owners rudeness, inexperience, and poor business skills. Oh by the way, the new bike I finally got I believed was deliberately scratched. This business does have good knowledgeable sales associates and bike techs.]
