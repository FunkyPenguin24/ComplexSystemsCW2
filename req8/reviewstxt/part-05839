[118303092987678374003,100468489713259296645,My mother and I went in on 2/14/13 and got a tragus piercing in each ear. Richard performed the piercing, he was very patient and explained everything he was going to do before doing it. Everything was clean and well taken care of. If I decide to get another piercing, I will go back to MOLA and request Richard again!]
