Remember that when reading reviews that are negative and vague as well that you should take them for a grain of salt. If your willing to trash on a company you should be willing to actually explain yourself... just waisting peoples time otherwise I will be honest the old mechanic who's is not there anymore definitely had a bad attitude at times and I can understand why some people would not be happy with him. He knew his stuff and got it done buuut at times was pissy pants. Brad, the new mechanic is a great guy! He is one of the most knowledgable mechanics I have ever met and he is always out learning new things to better help peoples needs. As for the sales staff, I am not actually sure they can be rude, Kelsey the young girl who works there is always the most polite and helpful person. Either way, Hey! If your in the neighborhood stop buy and meet the staff and check out what they have to offer.]
