[110514133063469010074,100989627599470376608,Due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to obtain another vehicle. We were directed to come to Elephant Auto Group to see what could be done for us to purchase another vehicle. As most people know the car buying process can be uneasy, even stressful. Even though we have been here two days we finally agreed on a vehicle. Not the first choice but an exceptional and nicer vehicle. Due to our salesman ( Chris Duke ) we got a better car and rate cause he went the extra mile and kept looking even though there was a vehicle on the lot that we were actually looking into. Thanks]
