[102130601989631932885,100376785750501711048,While the facilities are nice, I've had nothing but problems during my ten visits there. To top it off, I was only parking there for the Frontier points and not a single point was ever credited to my account. The problems I had included: long waits for the return shuttle, they lost my car after I had then change my oil (It took about an hour to find) they promised my car would be in valet after the oil change and it wasn't, they've forgotten to drop me at my car, and they're incorrectly charged me and then told me they couldn't give me a refund for the difference.]
