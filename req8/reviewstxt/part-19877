[108020049708524831221,100053366202246417499,Highly unprofessional management. We saw the beautiful pictures online and made reservations and were there in one hour from Houston. It was our anniversary. Upon arrival we found this was not in the updated historical part of Galveston's historical district but in an undesirable area. As we approached the gates two local bums awaited us. Across the street was a group of people sitting on cars and in the front yard with a loud boom box blaring. There is no secure parking and we were not going to leave our nice vehicle parked out on the street in this neighborhood. And this does not have the appearance of a place that is a safe area to go for a walk. Upon entering we found that the place is not kept up as nice as others in Galveston. Then we found Window units for AC in the bedrooms. Its way over priced.The Manager was not there so we spoke to the brother who said the manager would be back later. We left a note saying we could not spend our anniversary here. That it was not in a neighborhood where my wife felt safe. the Manager finally called and he refused to give back any portion of our $800. They were insulted and became angry, rude, and defensive. because we said we did not feel safe there. They offered nothing. They stated quickly and firmly that the reservation was guaranteed. One hour...this is just a terrible way to do business. There are numerous very nice B B's in Galveston in the beautiful historic district with really good host that run them. I hope you find one of those.]
