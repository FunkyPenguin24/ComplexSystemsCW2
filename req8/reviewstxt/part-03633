[100316560463611081331,100348644570502009084,This place was great. I needed three tires and an alignment and had been saving up for what I thought was going to be extremely expensive. I spent way less than I expected and they got done in a much shorter time than I expected. I would definitely recommend Tire Discount on Pondella. Don't judge a book by it's cover. The shop was not like a Tire-Chain type of shop. It was a work place. But, let me tell you, the service was quick and inexpensive, and done right.]
