[102662932607847188985,100658485604430914610,We have been taking our fussy vehicles here now for about 10 years (we've lived in Arlington for 30) and would not go anywhere else. Highly qualified mechanics, outstanding customer service, utterly honest - highly ethical. They will work with you to solve any problem. As in our case, with a couple of older vehicles, they searched for reliable used parts to keep our costs lower (for a Mercedes and a Suburban). If you are buying a used car as our daughter just did, they will give a thorough assessment. They are willing to discuss their opinions about car performance and reliability if you are in market for a vehicle. They also work on classic/antique cars - the owner, Wade Aylor, is a specialist in this as well. Your car will be treated with TLC!]
