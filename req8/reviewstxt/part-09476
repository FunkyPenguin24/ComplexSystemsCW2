[110998664019058235471,100664997889941283047,Based on the positive reviews I had read on here, I called to make an appt, and I didn't even need one. Sam the owner was very nice, and the SMOG test was done in very little time. He offered me a bottle of water while I was waiting. Very personable service. Highly recommend it.]
