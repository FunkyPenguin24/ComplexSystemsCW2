[107585908726309208547,100640122039685983857,Being a world traveler I have been to many golf courses. The Augusta National is immaculate as befits a world class golf club. The waiting list is extremely long and the fees and membership cost about what a pair of Rolls Royces and a Ferrari do. It is not for the average person but you can get tickets and get to see how the other half lives. They have embarked on a program of buying up all the adjacent properties and even paid to relocate a major traffic artery. They just purchased a strip mall and apartment complex about a half mile away and plan to incorporate the property into the club. My recommendation is if you can manage to get tickets, go in, look around then get with more attainable stuff. Being what Augusta Georgia is like, the National is the best asset in town.]
