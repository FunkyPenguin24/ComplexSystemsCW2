[104483757387040526708,100290965716371250746,I placed the order at 9:14 and in less than 15 minutes it was ready to pickup. The pizza was great, good proportions, not over or undercooked and just how I ordered it. I did not take delivery, so i can't comment on it, but the staff where courteous and fast to take care of me. 3 Words: Good, Fast, Simple. Good Job Domino's!]
