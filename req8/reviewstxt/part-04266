[105110208993236977489,100385216648339016231,I recently refinanced my mortgage through Roundpoint, and my two star rating reflects my frustration with the slowness in completing the process, which took nearly two months from start to finish. It felt like a week would go by without any response or progress update. The worst was when Roundpoint tried to charge me another $300+ to extend the rate lock, despite the delays all being on their end; I was able to get the extra charge removed, but that was still a source of frustration. In the end, I am satisfied with the rate I got, and I hope that the servicing of the loan is competent, but just know if you refinance with them, it may take a lot longer than expected to complete the process.]
