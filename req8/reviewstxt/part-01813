I've never seen anything like it in my life! 5 teenage employees all standing around in a circle chatting it up. Dead fish before you even get them home home. Found out the next day My daughters teacher bought fish there the same day...guess what....dead in a few hours too. Try to return a dead fish? They have to get approval from "the dead fish dept?...lol we go to the place near Sarno and Apollo now. Very good service. If you want dead fish, get them bigger at the supermarket.]
