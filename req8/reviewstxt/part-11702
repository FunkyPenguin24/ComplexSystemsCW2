[106703497497585546369,100785528202466950442,My total experience with Jeremy House and his assistant Alexis was the most professional and thorough transaction I've ever had when purchasing a home. Their method was simple, yet every detail was handled and explained in a way I could understand. I received the documention I needed without an overload of complex paperwork and fine print to leave me second guessing what I just signed. It isn't often I experience a business encounter that I can say I am completely satisfied with; this was the exception. Thank you so much!]
