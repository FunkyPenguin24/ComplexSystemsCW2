[106504003991553909625,100616484444088256040,I bought a 1999 Jaguar XK8 convertible from Rosenthal Land Rover/Jaguar this week. Walking into a luxury car dealership (without a million dollar bank account balance) was not something I ever planned to do but the experience was not at all what I expected. Our salesman, Craig Faunce, was extremely helpful, genuinely friendly and applied absolutely zero pressure while we were looking over the car. The sales process was very quick and easy taking maybe 45 minutes. Craig took plenty of time explaining the features of the car and offering advice as to maintenance and care both before and after the sale. Whether you are looking for a brand new Jag or a great deal on a used one don't skip this dealership - and ask for Craig Faunce when you get there.]
