[101287356430492354858,100263856188271795603,First off; I just got my repair done and I just got the car back... secondly... VERY fast work, and great customer service. It was nice to get good service. As for PRICE? It's pretty much the same as everywhere else. Despite it saying fair prices, it's just average. No big deal really... but the problem I have is that after they replaced both my cam and crank sensors, and put a new valve cover gauge (or w/e it's called) I get my car, and by the time I take it home I realize the A/C doesn't work! Now I'm not really a mechanic myself, but I instantly felt like something was wrong. My A/C was perfect before it went into this shop... but anyways, I called up and they said they'll have to take a look at it, but to me it seems like they might have forgotten to put something back on or plug something back in after they fixed my car... which seems almost lazy or forgetful. I'd LOVE to move this review to Excellent status, but I will have to see how they handle my A/C... and see if they're going to try and charge me for it despite it working perfectly fine before they got their hands on my car. I'll update this review when that gets done. I'm hoping those guys fix w/e they did to it and send me on my happy way, because beyond that... these guys seem legit and good. Customer service is awesome, and they were speedy on getting my car fixed, they did call me once, to tell me what was wrong. Hope they fix their faults though!]
