[114682125558482108672,101000332340308878702,stayed in duck key last year & saw this place but was being remodeled. Wow! the price is great for the area, staff was so friendly & rooms were fresh, clean, & roomy. bathrooms had nice sized showers. outside the resort has an actual beach (many don't) with the pool not 20 yds from the waves. key colony is very nice. leigh annes & sparkys are within walking distance & very good. not to mention there is a tiki bar at the adjacent hotel that is accessed by a gate from glunz pool. if you know anything aabout room rates & want a beach, this is the place. marina jus across the highway has jet skis, charter rentals as does sparkys. our new home away from home. 5 stars!]
