[109567800537403966092,101127995796104081063,Skydive Philadelphia is great! The staff on ground was incredibly knowledgeable about the happenings of the weather and wind currents and storms and whatnot. We have had to reschedule a few times which would have been easier if we had smaller groups but nonetheless, they were as accommodating as possible within their means. As for the jump, BEST THING I'VE EVER EXPERIENCED! I have jumped two times now, both with Skydive Philadelphia and I can't wait to go again. My first time I was placed with Matt D. as tandem instructor and he was so incredible that I requested him for my second time this past weekend. I have to admit I was worried about forgetting what I was supposed to do but Matt simply told me the steps as I needed to know them which allowed me to enjoy my jump free of cares. The free-fall itself is the best part, I highly recommend paying the extra $10 to go big, it's dumb not to. As for the rest of the ride, up in the plane and down with the parachute, Matt was able to point different landmarks out and answer any dumb questions I had which was wonderful! As for the landing it was smooth and controlled enough to land standing! The other instructors I was talking with also seemed to enjoy their job. It was unique that they came from all over the world including Chris who my Mom and Boyfriend swear by and requested for their second time as well. I also have to note to ignore the dirty comments of people that weren't happy because of waiting or lack of food. You are waiting for your safety, and you signed up to skydive, not to have a picnic. The one time we did wait longer, we were provided with a list of food in the area and they told us to go and we could call and check in on the weather. I will absolutely be going again and as long as I am in the area, I will no doubt be jumping in Perkasie again!]
