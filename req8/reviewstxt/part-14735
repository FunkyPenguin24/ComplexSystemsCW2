[110167976157644172316,100952342567919917425,My first walk after moving to Portland's NW side had led me to a fantastic meditation tree on the NE corner of the Couch. It's a Redwood, it was '99, and it was nighttime. In the shadow of the Redwood and invisible to everyone, including Po Po, i began to awaken. Since then i return to this tree when i pass through or visit Portland.]
