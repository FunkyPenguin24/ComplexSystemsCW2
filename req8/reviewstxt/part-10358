[109369519215967327478,100712897931656106101,I have never been to a bar where the security guards/door men treated people with such little respect. My family and I have lived in North Park for most of our lives and go to this bar often because of the location and because we love this bar, but the men at the door are very rude and disrespectful to a lot of my family because they are in law enforcement. My family is loyal to the city and work hard to protect it and never expect any sort of special treatment but get treated like total crap because they are cops and they are resented by the security staff. I have worked in the bar industry my whole working life and have never witnessed such blatant disrespect towards people who dedicate their lives to the safety of these streets. It is so frustrating. Power trip to the highest level. Such a shame because this bar is a great bar. The security staff just really need to be put in check, or replaced.]
