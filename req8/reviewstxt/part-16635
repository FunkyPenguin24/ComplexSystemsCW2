[107384762430212033260,101055304766173884657,I had a membership with Cardinal Fitness for about a year. I had a credit card switched at a bar one night and had to get a new one. Cardinal Fitness failed to call me for 4 months and notify me my monthly charge was being declined. However they had no problem charging me an additional $15 per month for failed credit card transaction. They also failed to notify me that when I canceled that I was going to be billed for an additional months membership. This gym is shady. Don't go here!]
