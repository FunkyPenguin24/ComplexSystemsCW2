[103621328299646604570,100887604509290484350,We had a terrible meal here. Someone brought our dinners out on a tray and put it on a stand next to our table, and then disappeared. We watched our food get cold for a bit and then just served ourselves. No one came to the table for at least 15 minutes after the food was delivered. The waiter was rude and sarcastic. Our service was so bad that the manager agreed to remove the automatic gratuity, but then didn't. Some of the food was good but the gnocchi looked like cat food. This was one of the worst dining experiences we have ever had, and we eat in restaurants a lot.]
