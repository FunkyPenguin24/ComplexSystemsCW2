They even gave me 50% off of my meal because of it. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The manager came to me twice to make sure that I enjoyed my meal and also apologized for the mishap. It was obvious that they work very hard to make sure customers are happy. I'm not big on restaurant food chains, but I have to say that this was probably the best service I've had anywhere in quite some time. I was very impressed.]
