[104557218273751135440,100999048975834923062,So I went here for cupcakes, some gluten free, some regular. They looked like I made them myself. They tasted horrible. Actually had very little flavor at all. Guests thought icing tasted like crisco. I was so unimpressed I nearly cried at my son's birthday party when one of the moms asked how I had time to make the cupcakes. Very unimpressed for my $69 dollars worth of cupcakes (2 dozen). Walmart does a better job decorating and I could have had the glutten free made by someone closer to home at least. Will not ever go back.]
