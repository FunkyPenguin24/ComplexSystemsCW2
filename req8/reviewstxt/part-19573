[108660574076552508044,100036916974775609113,I don't feel I can trust them! Beat and switch! Almost 7 hours to install a set of tires with a Scheduled appointment !! Read my version of the story. Brought my 2 year old car in for a Oil change. "Sir you have a delaminated tire on your car would you like to see it!" Of course I wanted to see it and of course I wanted new tires installed. Showed me some tires, picked out a set of Michelin tires. He tells me it going to take a few hours to install. I was in a hurry and scheduled an appointment for 9 A.M next morning. I made my scheduled appointment (Early) sat around for 2 hours and I asked how much longer. "Should be about a hour or so, we had several people in front of you". But I pre-paid for my tires and had an Appointment for 9 A.M?. I was in the process of Moving and had a ton of things to do so walked Home, 4 hours later they call, "Mr. Alati I sorry to inform you but we were not able to get your tire delivered here today (this was a Saturday), can't get them until Monday, but I have an upgraded tire I can install at no extra charge, Smooth ride, 80,000 mile tire but it's a Big O Brand instead of Michelin tires" - Ya Ok fine, I needed my car. Two weeks latter I go back, tell them the car is pulling to the left and seams to run a little warmer than normal. There was 25 PSI in the Left front and down a quart of oil. I mentioned about how the ride wasn't as smooth as I was expecting "Oh, you should have gotten the Big-O xxx tire, they sold me good tires and installed a cheaper line!!]
