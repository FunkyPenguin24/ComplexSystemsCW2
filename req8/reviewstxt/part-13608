[117119085594586220911,100891002498820031457,For nine years (2 cars), I have been going to University Volkswagen for service because of the excellent service that Jon Fass and his team of great technicians have performed on my cars. I appreciate the honest and straight forward advice on maintenance that has over the long run saved me money on repairs. When my car was in need of a repair the price was very reasonable. They have a first rate organization and have always treated me with excellent service, even after car was long out of warranty. Jon truly cares about customer service and that makes a huge difference.]
