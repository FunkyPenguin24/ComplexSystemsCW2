[101118011752505958055,100798617059725130204,Rocky's pizza is worth the dough. I have enjoyed their pizza for many years. I always get delivery and Rocky's special is my favorite. It would compare to others supreme. Their pizza is very unique. It's similar to Greggs pizza. They cut it in strips not pie slices.]
