[101962409862112238979,100055585412294121964,I have never experienced such unprofessional service from a healthcare professionals office I've ever seen. The doctor himself was decent, however not one time was I ever greeted in a friendly or even civil manner via phone or in person. The staff was scantily clad in very unprofessional clothing during my weekday visit. When I tried to call in to pay my statement balance, Crystal tried taking my CC info without even pulling up my account and verbally attacked me for questioning as to how she was going to apply the payment to my account if she didn't even know what account I was paying!! I will never go back to this doctor based soley on his staff.]
