[104665960375858257659,100973933139135655402,Went this weekend to meet up with some friends. Location was packed to the point that people were waiting in line for slots. No big winners either, so their win ratio is very low. Bar was packed, restaurants were over booked. Go if you don't mind waiting and being bumped into every few minutes.]
