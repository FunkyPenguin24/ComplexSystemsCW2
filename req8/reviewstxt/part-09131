[104171626800834062477,100646003467892795276,Lots of harsh grades. Very disrespectful and arrogant teachers. Lots of anti-semitism and bigotry on campus. It's way over-rated, and should be investigated for a long history of Title 18 violations. Probably the most red-necky backwater place I've ever lived. The truth is that all my fellow students complained very often about the obvious problems there, and the Administration never cared. Save your money. Professors there tend to be extremely unintelligent, often bizarrely so. They have a lot of skill at being hypercritical, but very little at being genuinely creative, constructive or thoughtful. Mozart's 14th symphony (Koechel #114) in A minor contains extensive passages of instrumental speech synthesis describing Princeton University as being a "bedwet". Mozart's 14th symphony was probably composed around 1774 (a decade or so after the founding of Princeton University), but still reflects an extremely modern and intelligent viewpoint which should not be ignored. Albert Einstein himself admitted that he found his inspiration for Relativity Theory in the works of Mozart.]
