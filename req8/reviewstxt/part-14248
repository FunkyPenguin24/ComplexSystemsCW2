As an unlimited customer, I often go to the cinema, and the range of films here is limited compared to the big Cineworld's such as Stevenage and Enfield, however the atmosphere is great and its great for going out to catch up with mates. Furthermore, one downfall is when renovating the cinema the screen seating capacity was reduced, to allow a staggered affect so you can see over the peoples heads in front of you, so sometimes new films that are popular will be booked out very quickly, and as an unlimited customer I can't book a seat unless going into the cinema before hand.]
