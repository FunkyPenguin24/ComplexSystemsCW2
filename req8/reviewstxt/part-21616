[117809263164982662954,100146258951485297664,I've been to other Crossfit gyms before and this one is my favorite. Not only does the gym feature a spacious and fully fitted showroom, but the atmosphere is uptemo and the people are friendly! Don't be afraid to walk right in and start talking to someone because they are very welcoming. Different from other Crossfit facilities, the staff here really lets you improve on your weaknesses and allow you to customize your programming to fit your specific needs. They realize that not everyone has the same methods of meeting their fitness goals, and I have realized first hand the benefits of that. I would recommend stopping by no matter who you are or what shape you're in, don't be intimidated by the Crossfit on ESPN, there are all types of people here at Paradigm.]
