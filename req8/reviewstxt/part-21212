[101909362057935304907,100123677494088643766,True North is a warm, friendly, laid-back place that offers a variety of house-made baked goods, sandwiches, and espresso drinks. I was on the hunt for a latte, anything that wasn't Dunkin' Donuts. A true quest in the North Shore. I ordered a medium-sized whole milk latte and had the nice option of having it in a paper cup or to enjoy it in a mug and sit and stay a while. The medium was enormous. The espresso was over extracted but had promising notes. The milk was over heated making the drink too warm and allowing the usual carmelizing effect of the milk to be lost. Not a hint of latte art to be had. However, the cafe is using a professional espresso machine and what appears to be high-quality beans. Given the proper instructions and practice, the coffee jock could turn into a true barista and those beans would reveal their true flavors. While there, we sampled some house made muffins, lemon poppy seed and cranberry, both were fresh and moist. The cafe has a true local feel with a steady stream of people coming in and sitting and staying to catch up with friends. In an area of the country known for rough and rush (I know I grew up there) this was a nice change of pace. I'll stop in on my next visit to Burlington but perhaps opt for some tea and a fresh scone and continue my latte quest in a different cafe.]
