[111005477891407240722,100567829408264449007,Been there long ago, and the food and atmosphere was magical. We were fortunate enough to spend the night in the two cute rooms above the restaurant and then went for a hike the next day. The WWII history and story of the fabulous lady proprietor made the weekend even more special. Highly recommend.]
