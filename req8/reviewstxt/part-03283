[113554079033835181590,100328718245904061249,I had an extremely pleasant experience when I first came here late august 2012. This was the 4th bridal shop that I had been to that day and they made the dress trying on feel like something you would see off of tv, which is why I decided to buy my dress from them. I ordered my Eddy K dress on January 12th, 2013 and was told that the dress would take at maximum 6 months to get in, which was fine because my wedding wasn't until October. June came and went no dress..... July came and went, still no dress..... By mid august I had made quite a few phone calls to them with no response back. So I went into the store and they said that the dress would be in the first week of September. Okay.... Second week of September I started calling again, and again no phone call back. My dress finally came in the third week of September, of course I got 2 phone calls the day the dress came in. I paid full price for the dress. Now I have less than a month to get the alterations I need done. Needless to say I kinda got screwed over on this deal.]
