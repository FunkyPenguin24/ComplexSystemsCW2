[115311389958159137253,100713042042188457112,DO NOT USE THIS CLEANERS! I brought a shirt in to be cleaned. They gave it back to me completely torn and said it was because the shirt was "worn". All of my other shirts that thy cleaned show fraying at the collar, where there was no previous fraying. THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS THE ABSOLUTE WORST. They are rude and very short with customers. This place is awful and needs to be out of our community.]
