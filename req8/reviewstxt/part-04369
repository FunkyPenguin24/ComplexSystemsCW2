[112050209115680658140,100391158143402731037,My husband originally went to Moda Italia for shirts for an upcoming business trip. He found shirts he liked but they needed to be altered. When he returned for the altered shirts, he received two shirts that were in stock (with no alterations). Now, the other two shirts were put on order and he left for his trip without the shirts in the colors that he wanted. After three trips to the store, numerous phone calls (most not returned) and almost a month of waiting for these shirts, he did receive the missing two shirts.. We had lost hope of actually receiving the shirts. (I visited the store mid-week when it was less busy to try to get their attention, and gave them our home address to please send the shirts to our home. Weekends are hectic in the store.) When the last two shirts arrived in the mail, one of the shirts was a duplicate color so he still was missing one of the colors he really wanted. The shirts probably would have been in stock at a regular department store. My husband had paid for alterations to the original shirts but again was glad to have received any shirts in his size. (Sidenote: On one of the return trips, he was pressured into buying ties and pocket silks, which he really didn't need or want.) The disorganization, the up-selling, and pure craziness frustrated both of us that you could not in good conscience refer anyone to the store; Hence the two stars (and I am rounding up, more like 1 1/2 stars)]
