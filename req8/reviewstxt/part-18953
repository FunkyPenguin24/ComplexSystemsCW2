[102619325831318435208,100003526899340184991,Excellent customer service and service period! I went in for a battery test and front bumper molding issue. The molding ended up being caused from damage and they still fixed it under warranty! Also gave me a discount on my oil/filter change (was my first visit, first time Mitsubishi owner). Thanks guys!]
