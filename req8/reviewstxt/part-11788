[102616270357009449387,100790044340447716306,A car that this shop worked on was towed to my shop because it had been improperly repaired by Auto Xperts! Chris is the owner and the car that they had worked on was towed into my shop because they had improperly routed spark plug wires and it caused the car to stall. We diagnosed the problem and called Chris the owner to explain the problem. Chris was very upset that I had called and he demanded that my shop fix the customers' car free of charge as a favor to him!! The work performed on this car was very very bad! Any technician who has any training would not perform work like this to any customer car. We did not cause the problem to this car - the problem was caused by poor workmanship by Auto Xperts. I would not recommend this shop based on the way that they treated both the customer and my shop.]
