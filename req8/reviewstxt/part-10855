[108975564085144373042,100739613508547883426,The first pest prevention people I've been involved with but so far I couldn't be happier. I've looked into pest prevention programs before and it never seemed worth the cost. Alterra goes beyond the normal spray and pray, and knocks out visible issues with pests as well as puts out a prevention coverage that exceeds what I've seen offered anywhere else. Aaron came out today and swept all the spider webs out of my eaves during his visit and removed a wasp nest to keep them from setting up in my home. My entire outside is covered now, and Aaron even sprayed around inside my garage to get rid of spiders. My wife is arachnophobic and I am so glad to have a company so dedicated to helping calm her down about the spiders and other bugs. Thank you Aaron and thanks Alterra for your hard work and great value!]
