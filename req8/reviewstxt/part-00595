Although I have not dined in during peak hours on the weekend, I have been there at noon and the food quality & service have been family friendly. This place does not make the carnitas and chicharron once it the morning and keep it warm all day there is a constant fresh batch daily well into late afternoon. You are guaranteed at least a Free Taco of carnitas if your order is to go and Free order of chicharron if you check-in on Facebook. Feel free to tweet them at @UruapanCarnitas they will make you SMILE :)]
