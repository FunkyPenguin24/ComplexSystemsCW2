[106457817837420311385,101039935917370735870,As a relative newbie to the Fitness Dungeon I have to say "WOW". Accountability is everything! I would NEVER have pushed myself and sweated like I do on my own. Every workout brings new challenges, and although I'm sure I'm going to be sore, I find myself looking forward to each challenge and seeing my strength and endurance get better and better every week. Xavier knows his stuff...and knows all of the excuses so don't show up with any, he will squash them like a bug. Xavier's energy and pure passion for fitness will motivate you and keep you moving through any workout. I'm glad I found the Fitness Dungeon and would recommend it to anyone.]
