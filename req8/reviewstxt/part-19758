A Psychometric tests which were described as follows, Psychometric tests are not like a regular tests as the answers cannot be learned off by heart. They are essentially timed aptitude tests. So what the employers want to know is what your natural ability is at a certain subject. While many employers assume the test cannot be practiced in advance of an interview, the truth is, it can. Given the strict tight time limitations for taking psychometric tests, if you did not practice beforehand, you will likely gain a very average score. What it boils down to is that even people who are very good at verbal reasoning or numeracy will do badly unless they have practiced their timing. Through practicing psychometric tests online, you can also gain an understanding of what the real test may look like and how it will operate – giving you a little boost of confidence when taking the real test!
