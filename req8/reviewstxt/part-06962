[110715546852107273039,100531242758773771973,Started the buying process online. Compared to other Ford dealers in the area I have purchased from, Jarrett Ford was simple and pleasure to work with. My sales person was Paul Gomez whom I would recommend to others. Paul was friendly and went out of his way to close the deal. He even drove 30 miles out of his way to have paperwork signed by my wife. His e-mail responses were prompt and helpful. After coming to terms on a price, the rest of the sales process was easy and fast. No pressure to purchase additional products after I was asked and declined. I will purchase from Jarrett Ford again.]
