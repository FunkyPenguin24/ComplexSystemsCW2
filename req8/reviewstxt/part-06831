[107832743402660297293,100523751472540620142,The place doesn't look like much, but the service and food more than make up for it. I don't think it is the best pho in the city, but the accouterments are super fresh and the food is extremely consistent. The prices are reasonable, and the staff is attentive and friendly. A great little hole in the wall place for good food at a reasonable rate.]
