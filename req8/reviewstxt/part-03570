[109016598781541061171,100344920819111857210,This is a hidden gem of pampering in downtown Seattle! I regularly get waxings here and every single aesthetician is fantastic! Sonja and Brenna are my favorites for Brazilians. They have a European style waterless manicure/pedicure technique that, once you try it, you will NEVER go back to the other kind. Everyone is super nice and friendly, and there is a relaxing waiting area, too. I tried the collagen bed the other day and it was fun, although I am still not sure what the benefits are. The massage therapists are excellent. I have never had a bad treatment here. I am not a facial person, so can't comment on those, but I highly recommend this place. They offer discounted valet parking while you are there, too.]
