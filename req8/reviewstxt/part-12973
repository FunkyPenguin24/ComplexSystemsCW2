[109906326436264787905,100855523040153278743,Gun range was ridiculously hot. It was set at 91 degrees when it was 96 outside. There's not much point in shooting inside when the set the temperature just as high. Their rentals are $15 for a relatively small selection (except the glocks). They also box their ammo with some weird/random name but the ammo inside is something else (i.e. Independence with Blazer Ammo, and some other name with Federal ammo inside it) Also, they don't fully honor the Groupons they offer. The Groupon states two rental handguns and 100 rounds of ammunition total. However, when we showed up, they said the groupon is restricted to only .22 handguns and ammunition, which were only about 3 handguns and maybe a pair of rifles.]
