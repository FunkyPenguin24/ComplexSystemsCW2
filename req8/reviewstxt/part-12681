[105582123169881244111,100839180381473794758,My husband and I recently worked with Leslie Vandivier of Reilly Realtors. As first time home buyers, we were very anxious about the process. Leslie managed to find us our dream home and guide us through the home buying process. She was there every step of the way, pointing us in the right direction. We will definetly return for any future real estate needs.]
