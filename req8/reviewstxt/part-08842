This is my first time trying to do a organic vegetable garden and every time I need a question answered or a product- Seth, Andrew and Jake are always there to help. They are extremely knowledgeable and helpful. Wouldn't have such great veggies if it wasn't for their help. Will be more than happy to refer to our friends. Thanks Guys!]
