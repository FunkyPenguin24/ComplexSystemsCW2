[115474480621544691353,101172949493796329534,I want to say that I sure appreciate the staff and Dr. Kutsch for their kindness and professionalism. You care for our needs and especially after major work has been done, you call Dr. after hours to find out how I'm doing. It helps to know you want to show a bit of a personal touch. Thank you all for contributing to my comfort in spite of some difficult work on my teeth! You're all great.]
