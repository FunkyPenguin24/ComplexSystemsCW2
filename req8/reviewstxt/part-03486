[104111370179844915014,100339714104625951228,I have to say I really LOVE this place! I started going here a couple months ago because another nail tech, named Theresa at a Forum nail studio, completely messed up my nails. The owner of this salon did an AMAZING job on my nails! I couldn't have asked for better service. The owners designs are beautiful and she is a complete perfectionist. I am looking forward to my next visit. Don't go if you are in a hurry because they take their time and do not rush; which, is one of the reason they are so good. The strive to make you happy. I highly recommend going to this salon!!!]
