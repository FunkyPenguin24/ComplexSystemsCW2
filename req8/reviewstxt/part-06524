[102694911383808107149,100506013023090888749,Just as others have said, Grismer is over priced. Last week my daughter took her car in for new brake pads, rotors, and a new caliper on one side. The cost, $1000. I don't know if they thought they were trying to take advantage of a young woman or what, but we didn't let them do the work at that price. We took it over to Sears at Fairfield Commons and they did the same work for $428. I got an estimate from the new foreign car repair place across from the Meijer gas station, and it was about $450. Be careful of Grismer! They may OK for tires, but that's about it!]
