[108120507833675500625,101098542265200612447,Nancy is awesome! I went through Enforcement Trainers to get my hand gun certification and not only did she give me a one on one class but we also went to the range and practiced. It was such a fun time and I learned a lot. She focuses a lot on safety which is key when owning a gun and she taught me how to do everything from standing correctly, to unloading and loading. Everything I needed to know. She does an awesome job and I would highly recommend her to everyone!]
