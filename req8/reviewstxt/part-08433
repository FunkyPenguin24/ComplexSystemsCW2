[113730570444879610000,100610176189507964796,I can't begin to express how happy I am with Critter Caretakers! Dawn and Christine took the time to come over and meet my cats and thoroughly explain their policies before I left on vacation. My cats can be very finicky about strangers, especially my Maine Coon. I've had cat sitters who said they never saw him the entire time they came in and only knew he was eating because his food always disappeared. But he and my other cat came right out to meet Dawn and Christine and made friends with them from the start. I was gone 11days and Christine and Dawn took turns sending me daily emails with pictures of my kitties. Such contact is tremendously reassuring when you are away from the pets you love. In addition to simply feeding and cleaning litter boxes, they took time to play with my kitties and also left detailed daily notes summarizing each of their visits. I think Clio (my tabby) has spent the morning today looking for Dawn and wondering why she hasn't come to play. (Apparently my "play" attempts don't measure up. LOL!) Thank you, Critter Caretakers! You are my "go to" pet sitters from here on out.]
