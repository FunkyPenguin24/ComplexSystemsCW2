[100106787408572177704,100249065539433042844,The Royal Albert is a beautiful pub in between New Cross and Deptford. Down the back they have an open kitchen where you can watch the chef cook up a storm. Up the front you will find some quiet corners where you can sit and play a board games or (occasionally) listen to a live jazz session whilst sipping your artisan beer of choice. Veggies beware the food is not particularly designed for you but meat eaters will love the gastropub menu available. #DavidBowieIs]
