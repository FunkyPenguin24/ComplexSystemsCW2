[100739282129301756482,100697391269637568770,This place is great! The family that runs it are true Greeks and the warmest people you'll meet. The food is fantastic! Parking is limited so if your planning on going for lunch make sure to get there early or call in your order ahead. Make sure you try the Greek fries, they are my Favorite!!]
