[100826750090100315485,100875628405652399202,I love the original Empire Palace, but the new one is also awesome! Great food and try some of the new dishes on the menu, the dim sum are really good. The place is very clean and the service is fast and always very friendly. I will keep going back again and again, they make great food and are very nice people, not to mention you always have enough for leftovers. :)]
