[111072012994307846501,101118822929093652319,The sign reads "Sculpted Nails," and that's what I wanted. I wanted gel nails, sculpted on with a form. When I walked in I asked how much this was. After calling the manager several times, I was quoted $70. I knew this was a fair price, so I agreed. When I sat down, the woman brought over a box of white nail tips. I clarified that I wanted sculpted gel nails, painted with a color, not French Tips. The woman kept insisting that the French would look better and I could come back and get them painted over when I was bored with the French. She also kept saying this was only going to be $45. I reluctantly agreed. She seemed friendly and meticulous at the time, but cut me on several fingers with the Dremel (which my blood got on and she did not sanitize except with the wipe of a dirty towel), clipped a piece of my skin with the nail cutter and applied the gel unevenly. My nails did not look great leaving the salon. When I got home, in better lighting, they looked even worse. In less than 24 hours, my nails started popping off. With the stress of a busy work week, my boyfriend did me the favor of taking the receipt, pictures of my cuts and the nail that fell off of my finger the next day in the hopes of receiving a refund. Long story short, the woman that cut my fingers ended up being more professional than the owner, himself. Pretty pathetic. After saying he would refund the money and then changing his mind, along with threatening his lawyer to call us, my boyfriend left without a refund. Worst. Nail. "Salon." Ever. AVOID!]
