[113077871179409980865,101165742461859945688,This is for my neice's family... I am waiting not to give a final review but so far, after they bought at used car with a warranty, we are waiting to see if they live up to "nothing like a Leta." It seems after phone calls that they are getting shrugged off. Warranty needs approved and no one seems to be able to do that. I hope they soon correct this so this review can be removed and a better one written.]
