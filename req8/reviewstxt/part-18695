[111254359607249304205,101166345096247111907,They told me that they are, "all about service", and they are. I had a warranty problem with my two year old Ariens snow blower and went on their website to find an authorized repair shop. They listed two, Preco Power Equipment in Wilbraham and FC Taplin Co. in West Springfield. Since I live in Wilbraham I called Preco. Their first question was did I buy it there. When I said no they told me it would take 4 or more weeks to repair the unit. When I said I would still take it there they then told me that they would charge me $30.00 for the warranty work. Obviously they didn't want to repair the unit because I didn't buy it there so I called the nest dealer on the list FC Taplin. There was a day and night difference in how I was treated. They told me it would take days instead of weeks to repair the unit. They said as long as I had a copy of the receipt and the unit was within the three year warranty period they would repair it. When I brought the unit over in my pick up truck they had me back up to their repair dock and unloaded it for me. When I went back in they had already processed my paper work and gave me my receipt and I was on my way.]
