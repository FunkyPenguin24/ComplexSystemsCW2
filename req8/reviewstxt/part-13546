[106100204252072707794,100887715120645081733,I performed work for Eco at four BlockBuster locations in and around the SF Bay area over 120 days ago. They have still not paid our invoices nor have they honored our REA's. If approached by them turn and run they will pay themselves and ignore the people who do their work.]
