[102375356175519947992,100657117444690047757,I took my cat there yesterday to get neutered and all of his shots. I also have taken all of our pets to get their shots there. I have never had a bad experience with them. The staff is always friendly and helpful. At discharge, they took the time to explain everything to me in detail. I will continue to take my pets there for their shots. Thank you for looking out for the people that don't have a lot of money to take them to a vet that will naturally charge them a lot of money to get the same procedure done for a 1/4 of the price.]
