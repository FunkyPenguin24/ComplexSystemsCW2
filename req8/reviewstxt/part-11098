[104378196551888469496,100753082940255452947,When I made an appointment to get the windows on my truck stripped and tinted I was a little uneasy because they only do strip jobs first thing in the mornings. However, they were very courteous and very quick. They got the two front windows redone in about 45 minutes. The only reason they got a very good rating instead of excellent is their lack of an answering machine. I called during their lunch hour but was unable to leave a message. However, they did call me back, apparently they have caller id, and I was able to make an appointment. Also, they built their price with the tax included so the price they tell you is the final price. This was a huge bonus.]
