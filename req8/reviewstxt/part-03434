[108921922148665307793,100336979284108550932,I have been a patient of Germany Dental for several years. I go to the dentist at least twice a year or more as warranted. I have always been treated with the utmost respect by the friendliest people you could ever hope to meet. The doctors and entire staff are very kind, courteous and professional. The office surroundings are very pleasant and extremely clean. I trust Dr. Germany and his staff 110%! I would, and have on numerous occasions, recommended Germany Dental to friends.]
