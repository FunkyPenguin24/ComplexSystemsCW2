[105402136562437306885,100327702584732883238,We have had Centric Internet service for 3 years now and up until about 4 or so months ago it was good then it all changed! They started having equipment issues and we were with out internet for days and the customer service was rude and unhelpful. They only offer excuses and never solutions. Recently our internet signal has been bouncing in and out. I called and Katie told she would send their tech up to our house to check out the equipment to make sure it was functioning properly. That tech never came. We called two more times before we were finally told that it was a miracle that we even had service (what have I been paying $50 a month for?) and if we wanted to find another internet service they would understand. I am not sure who owns Centric, but I would be furious if an employee of mine ever told a customer that! Even though I would have preferred to have had the issue fixed I am now being forced to find a new service. I would caution anyone thinking about getting Centric Internet to shop for something else.]
