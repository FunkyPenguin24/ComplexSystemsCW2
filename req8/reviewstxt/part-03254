[100284569914211211205,100326882231741558950,I was a tenant with Premier and was very pleased with them. When we moved in there were several issues at our house one of which being mold. This was at no fault to anyone since it was up in the attic which is not normally part of a move out inspection from a previous tenant. The mold was due to a loose exhaust vent from a bathroom fan which caused venting in to the attic creating moisture. They responded right away to remedy the issue and notified the owner of the house. There were other minor repairs that needed to be done and those were taken care of in a timely manner as well. Before our lease was up we had a family members house become available. Linda was very willing to work with us to find another tenant to move in to the house right away. There was a smooth transition and no lag in rent income for the owner. We left the house free of needing repairs and clean. We were not penalized for breaking the lease since there was no loss to the owner or Premier. I would recommend them for both owners and tenants.]
