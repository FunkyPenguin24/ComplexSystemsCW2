[115435629124506497615,100485210317221918394,For $45 a night this hotel met all our needs. We are traveling up the Western States on the cheap--this Inn was a great find. Clean rooms, microwave & Fridge, truck parking & free Wifi. A great working air conditioner topped it off. Perfect spot to rest up for another day of driving. Quiet area with about 5 restaurants within a block. A few things to consider....if you are picky---rooms are small and cozy, towels are thin and small. A great value! Loved the guy at the front desk---they don't get much real-er, lol! Be sure and pick up the free guide for Hotel discounts at a Denney's restaurant--there are some worthwhile gems in it.]
