[115007648688033938857,100268134163561723920,On Tuesday, June 18th, 2013, I was on my way back from Huntsville, AL, to my home in Virginia in an attempt to bring my parents' truck in advance of their official move back to Virginia. On the highway as I was traveling through Knoxville, TN, the check engine light started to flash on the dashboard and the truck's engine began to show signs of considerable misfiring. I immediately had to pull over at the next exit. After a short Internet search on my phone, I found this repair center and was able to drive the truck. In no time, the manager, Calvin Esau, looked at my engine, hooked up the diagnostic tool, and was able to confirm the misfiring of my cylinders. He then proceeded to move the vehicle into the shop and the mechanic quickly determined that there was a problem with my distributor cap and rotor. Within minutes, Mr. Esau was on the phone with a local parts dealer and was able to get them to deliver the parts that I needed for my vehicle. In only 15-20 minutes since I arrived at the center, the truck was fixed and I was able to return to my highway travel back to Virginia with no more engine problems. I was truly impressed with the professionalism and honesty that Mr. Esau and his crew showed me. He could have easily taken advantage of me by giving me additional charges that were unnecessary especially considering I was caught in a bind, but yet he treated me with class and respect. I would highly recommend this center to anyone who is in need of car repair whether it is a transmission or general engine repair. They will treat you right. Thank you Calvin and Speedy Transmission!]
