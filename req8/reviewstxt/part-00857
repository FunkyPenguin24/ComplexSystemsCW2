[103479876845990901520,100203621343458081767,We lost our home in the May 20, 2013 tornado. Jennifer did return my call regarding a property I had called about but when she called she was very rude. Acted like she just wanted to get me off of the phone. Didn't even offer any other properties. Thanks for the horrible service JENNIFER DAVIS!]
