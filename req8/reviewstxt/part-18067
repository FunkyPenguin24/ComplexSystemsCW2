[107155916660738761141,101133352839660542526,Just had my son's 13th Birthday party at Xtreme Lazer Tag in Avon, IN. It was a blast. The Birthday party package they had was excellent. Nick, who hosted our party was excellent. He was great with the boys and the entire party. Would highly recommend a birthday party there or any other time you want to enjoy a competitive game of Lazer Tag. Thank you for a great Birthday Party.]
