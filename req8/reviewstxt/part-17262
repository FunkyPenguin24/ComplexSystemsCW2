[104499292441106927097,101090455382087103910,I've taken my moms Camry and my wife's Accord here for repairs and smog. The head mechanic is very charismatic and knowledgeable when diagnosing. The smog station is very thorough and considerate of your car's interior. Top that with fair pricing and HONEST evaluations I find myself returning and referring this shop any chance I get. This shop may not be state of the art or up to date...but they GET THE JOB DONE and they GET IT RIGHT. If they don't get it right they're straight up and tell you. Be a man...do the right thing...go to Lemon Grove Smog Test Only.]
