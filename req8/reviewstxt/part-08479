[109599481175090653727,100612595292067864586,I second the multiple poor reviews on this site. I am an unhappy, dissatisfied customer. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THIS RIDICULOUS COMPANY. You will be disappointed. Our AC went out. We had a 1:30 appointment. Chris showed up at 2 pm. He left b/c he was unable to fix it at that moment and said he would be back in 30 minutes. 6 pm comes--no Chris. 7 pm---still no Chris. I took off work to sit in a hot house all day and wait for a repair man who never returned or called back. We called him several times and the phone went straight to voice mail. Ridiculous. So unreliable and unprofessional. A complete waste of time.]
