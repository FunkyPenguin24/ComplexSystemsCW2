[105596772234989074936,100457602251139024278,Excellent food, owner's always there, excellent service (guaranteed your water will always be full haha) and place is nice and welcoming. I live 2 blocks away from this place and i already decided to make Libertad my regular dining place. Food is affordable and they have an EXCELLENT choice of alcohol beverages. If you're thinking you can get a budlight or millerlite then might as well go to the pizzeria down the block. Everything is top notch here only wished i could've been there out on the patio during the summertime. FIVE STARS ***** in my book for sure.]
