[100253231455094234454,100368832787354751525,I like Sams if you are new to Sams pizza it can be thin crust. Yet, you can order double crust which I think is allot better. I like the 2x crust Sams special -anchovies add peppercinines (aka yellow peppers). Which for the value is around $15 which for all those topping is a value. Sams has been around for a while and Sam does not treat his employees very well. Dictatorship which means he has total control over the place. Which also means the employees are not very happy to be yelled at. Don't be surprised if he yells at an employee in front of you and your family with no apology. The pizza Nazi, is it worth it that decision is yours.]
