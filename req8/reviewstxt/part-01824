[113537558691051575180,100253591856539256561,I recently purchased a Toyota Rav4 EV from Diane Whitmire at Carson Toyota. She responded to my email quickly, with full details of all aspects of the purchase. The paperwork was ready and my wife and I were quickly on our way in my new EV. However, I was not surprised by the great service. We have leased or purchased 8 cars from Diane. In addition, I have sent numerous friends and family to her -- all of them sing her praises as well. Diane knows Toyotas, especially the Prius and electric vehicles, and will honestly answer every question about the car and purchasing or leasing it. The out-the-door price was the lowest of every dealer I contacted -- including the largest one. While I haven't yet had the vehicle serviced (it has only 1200 gasoline free miles on it), the service department silenced the annoying back-up beep courteously and quickly.]
