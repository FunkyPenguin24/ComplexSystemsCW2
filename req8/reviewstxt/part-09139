[101385781410175622760,100646294119400809772,Just discovered they opened up near where I work and though I'd try them for lunch. Had an excellent enchilada suizas while my lunch companion enjoyed the tortilla soup! Service was friendly and efficient. They definitely will become one of our regular lunch stops. They are in process of constructing an outdoor street dining patio that looks nice.]
