[105147977785013500489,100287443674424029248,Beautiful music. I have listen to Paul write, teach, compose, and play music for almost seven years. He is a fantastic individual and takes care of everyone he does business with. Also, his skills in the recording studio and on song production are unparalleled. I cannot not recommend this musician any higher. Just phenomenal!]
