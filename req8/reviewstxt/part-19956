[114868056926247854259,100057445808601893924,Its 3 a.m.. im on a quick break from work. For the second time I have sat in this drive thru for over 20 minutes after ordering. You never hear sorry for the wait, you're never given anything for the inconveniences, and you are looked at like you're an idiot for getting a little pissed off that it takes 20 minutes to make one single egg McMuffin. The first time I drove off after 15 minutes. I tried this is the second time hoping that maybe it was just a bad night, but apparently this place sucks! Avoid! Let me mention that it didn't even taste good, either. Fail on mcdonalds! Also, since I have worked fast food I pay attention to details and I'm noticing that they are not even putting in the orders into the computer until after you get to the window ( and you don't pay until right before your food gets out )so that their time doesn't look bad to human resources! Smh]
