[101020395565246690671,100609059021774048841,My experience with Seabrook, 3000 Essex Rd., Tinton Falls, NJ 07753, was HORRENDOUS. I have elderly parents who live there. Someone from Seabrook's housecleaning staff stole a valuable item from my parents' apartment. The management hierarchy at Seabrook never even took the time to investigate the incident. All they did was cover up the incident. I would NEVER have allowed my parents to live there had I known Seabrook management were such con artists - just like any other large bureaucracy. Take the advice of someone who cares deeply about elder care: DON'T LIVE AT SEABROOK; DON'T LET YOUR PARENTS LIVE AT SEABROOK.]
