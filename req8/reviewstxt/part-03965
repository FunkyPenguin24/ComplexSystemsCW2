[114895670191534126805,100367271287572225393,I went in to get thousands of dollars worth of work done on my HHR after a hail storm and had to wait two and half weeks for it all to be done. They had all the parts, and I was quoted to have it back in one week. I called after a week and they couldn't give me a definite answer on when it'd be done. No one communicated to each other there so each time I called I had to re-explain what was going on. They didn't offer me a rental car until two days before they said it wold be done for sure, at which point I refused. They should have offered it day one. Once I got my car back things we still broken on it and new chips where all over the body from them. Dirt was also somehow all over the inside roof of my car. Needless to say, I will not be going back to them ever. Their service is way below par.]
