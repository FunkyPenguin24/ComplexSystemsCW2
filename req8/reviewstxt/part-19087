[106227587492874881282,100010294513635585347,This was my last visit to this particular Dunkin. Sad, because I work right across the street and this is a convenient place to get my morning coffee fix. I understand mistakes happen. But, this is the 4th day in a row my order has been wrong. It's not like my order is rocket science - a medium iced coffee with cream and sugar and either an oatmeal or wake up wrap. That's it. Last Friday, ordered the usual. Got back to work and opened up the bag, and found a wheat bagel instead of my wake up wrap. This past Monday, just coffee today, but when they handed me my drink, it was a hot coffee. I had to wait while they made a new one, and pay extra for the iced, even though it was their mistake. This Tuesday, waited in line forever, they handed me a Coolata of some sort and no oatmeal. Again, had to wait while they remade everything (this after waiting in line). Today, placed my order, finally made it to the window, and had to repeat my order in its entirety to the girl at the window, and again wait while they made everything again. There are plenty of other Dunkins out there (I pass by 3 on my way to work each day). Guess I will be stopping by there. So sad, because this place was convenient. Well, their lack of organization and basic food service skills lost a daily customer.]
