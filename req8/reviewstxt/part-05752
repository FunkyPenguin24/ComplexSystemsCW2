[113976395625591938504,100463982312477294510,I'm a small business owner in the service, a/c-refrigeration, industry. My 10 year old service truck gave out and I needed to get a new service vehicle quickly. My sales person, Jerry Rhodes, was extremely helpful in finding the right vehicle to get me back on the road to success. Jerry found me a van, got it in to the store, had it detailed and I was on my way in just two days. I came in on Saturday afternoon and was completely finished on Monday. With the vehicle coming from another location, I am very pleased with the turn around time. Pricing was right, financing was better than I could have obtained on my own and everyone was pleasant to deal with. I would definitely recommend Jerry and Levis to my friends.]
