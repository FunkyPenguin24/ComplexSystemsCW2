[105812803291691879583,100282182866696955656,1 star is too generous for this business! The driving inspector was VERY unprofessional! While inspecting my daughters driving, the inspector told story after story of students whom he had failed this driving test and he had my daughter completely distracted and nervous. He rambled incessantly through the entire test and she could not concentrate. She blew right through a stop sign because the idiot would quit talking to her. The owner of the company admitted that they purposely use this distractionary tactic to "put the driver and parents at ease." In actualilty, it's just a shady business practice to force repeat business...they figure they can keep collecting 50 bucks for each attempted test while doing everything in their power to distract the aspiring young driver...What a rip off! I demanded a refund because i didnt feel like my daughter got a fair chance to pass the test. They were VERY rude to me, even to point of threatening to call the police to report me for harrassment! Very poor customer service overall...they even instructed their receptionist to hang up on me! The owner refused to speak to me about my complaint on the phone, until I went in there in person and demanded to wait to be seen in person. We found much better, and more professional inspectors at Century Driving school right around the corner!]
