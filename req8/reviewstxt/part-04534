[100659550542862816957,100400625746085117092,After dealing with Kevin and Mary Francis I have one regret... that I'm not in the market for a mortgage more often! I wish they sold groceries, or gasoline, or something that would allow me to do business with them all the time. Kevin educated my wife and I on the in's and out's of mortgages to an unprecedented degree and instilled us with absolute confidence. I couldn't recommend Kevin and Mary more highly - they are truly spectacular!!]
