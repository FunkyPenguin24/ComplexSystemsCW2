[117145339326476195832,100549912219260191650,This place does not even deserve one star. For starters these jacka**es are very rude. I was trying to get information on a few vehicles for my business and no one ever contacted me back. When I called prior to that I kindly asked for details on a certain vehicle and they just said come in. I live in Michigan and I won't waste my time driving there if I don't know something. I only found out about this place because my secretary searched for vehicles in Michigan for my company and and they showed up as Central Detroit. False advertisement. On another note I have a relative in the Better Business and he told me they have numerous complaints because their cars are sh*t. Every last one of them. That's why they are sold so low and as it of course. They should be shut down soon hopefully.]
