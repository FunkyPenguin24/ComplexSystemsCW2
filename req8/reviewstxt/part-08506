[115196683442661145170,100613820272252546853,My mother and I spent 5 nights and 6 days in Ann Arbor at the Ann Arbor Bed and Breakfast, it was truly a wonderful experience. Each breakfast was exquisite, and lots of choices. The hospitality could not have been better. Our room was very comfortable we had a queen bed and a desk and two chairs which worked our perfectly for us. The bed and breakfast has lots of charm and distinction, and a wonderful patio/deck that was very relaxing and comfortable. I would highly recommend it]
