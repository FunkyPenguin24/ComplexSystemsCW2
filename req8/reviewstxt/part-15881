[112802577637434278871,101014603717364811686,I had the most professional experience with Tomball Ford when I, a 66 year young woman bought my 1st Ford Mustang convertible. What a joy. They zipped the financing right though, low rate, low payment. The Mustang has been 3 years running in Christmas parades. Carrying the pagent contestant for the Waller Parade, who won the finals. I t was in the Magnolia Christmas Parade carrying the Grand Marshall. What fun it is to have a Mustang. They will be repairing my Explorer today. Thank you Tomball Ford for a good experience.]
