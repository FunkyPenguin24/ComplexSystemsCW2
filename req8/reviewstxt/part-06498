[103780202050708603077,100504367361644402233,The moment we toured this facility we knew this was the best place for our child! Our daughter started going here at 3 months and we are constantly reminded of the excellent decision we made every time we drop her off! The front desk if very inviting and remembers you to make you feel welcomed and the staff are amazing with the kids! Our daughter has the biggest smile on her face every time I drop her off. As a parent it brings peace to your heart to know your child is happy and enjoys her time there. We recommend this for any parent looking for a place that offers more than just a daycare !]
