[102947236451308154248,100003918404903358454,The food here was not bad. It was basically the only place on the main strip my boyfriend and I could afford to eat at. I have to say though the best part of our experience was listening to one of the locals who came in, Tim the Fisherman. He was hilarious and had us laughing the whole dinner!]
