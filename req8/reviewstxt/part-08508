[100328880902794402831,100613874806799309613,Pilsner beer is very good. The roper sandwich and fries was awesome. The service was ok, nothing to write home about. Quite frankly, i believe this place blows away the Wind River Brewery in Pinedale Wy. which has very low quality of food at high price.]
