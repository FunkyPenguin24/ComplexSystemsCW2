[101797777100674028704,100763510714716685694,"My son, who was born three months prematurely and was one and a half years old at the time, was unable to hold his head up straight since birth. His head was in a constant lean to the left and he could not fully straighten it out. I would lift his head and it would drop to the side. Each time I brought my son to the pediatrician regarding the issue he would say, “everything is fine, the muscles are just undeveloped on that side of his neck due to his premature birth and it will get better as he gets older”, This wait and see approach was unacceptable to me and I wanted another opinion. I decided to consult a chiropractor. After an extensive search I was referred to Dr. Peter Marcus. It took Dr. Marcus all of 30 seconds to locate the exact cause of the problem and it wasn’t undeveloped muscles. According to Dr. Marcus it was a spinal misalignment. I was nervous about Dr. Marcus performing an adjustment on my one year old son’s neck but Dr. Marcus assured me that my son would be fine and that it was perfectly safe. I felt confident that he knew what he was doing so I agreed. In one quick adjustment (and a loud pop that I must admit scared me) my son’s neck immediately straightened out and he has never had that problem again. My wife and I were absolutely amazed. My son is now seven and Dr. Marcus is still our family chiropractor. I would recommend Dr. Marcus without hesitation."]
