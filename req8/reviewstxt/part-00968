[107337618205909928726,100209212134112280138,My wife and I make the trek all the way from North Vancouver to take our cats Itchy & Scratchy to Surrey Animal Hospital because while it may be somewhat of a "no frills" facility (out front at least), the compassion with which our furbabies are treated is above reproach. In addition, we feel that we are given ALL options, not just the expensive ones, with any risks/rewards explained to us so that we can make an informed decision best suited to our particular situation. Thanks SAH!]
