[102047424698660267123,100562746878166736048,Overall experience was good. The wait staff is very helpful. Food was OK but not exceptional for the prices they charge. Surf and Turf is 3 pieces of shrimp or scallops and an 8oz filet mignon, vegis and potatoes for $34. Make sure you ask for a first cut, non-rolled up scraps of filet mignon. They use the skinny end of the filet mignon to pass off a filet mignon. Over cooked and dry. Definitely did not melt in my mouth.]
