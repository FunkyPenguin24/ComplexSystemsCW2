[110826524941220699015,100182644195391899462,unfortunately we couldn't taste the food; I suspect, could have been good,as we were asked to rush with our menu order by some "waiter-boy"?. Initial-entry treatment by the staff was not any better, so my wife called it adios, and we ended up some blocks away in El Sombrero. We sure lost on a food; well, may be next time staff be more digestible so we will be able it digest the food. asta manianna ( sorry no speak Spanish).]
