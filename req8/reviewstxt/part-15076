[107611565244952731162,100970507423072106239,I live in New Jersey, so why am I reviewing a bicycle shop in Staten Island? Because it was one of the most pleasant shopping experiences of my life. I was told about Bay Street Bicycles by my brother in law. While there are some bike shops in New Jersey as well as the big box stores, I was told that this would be worth my trip. John the owner greeted me with a warm handshake, and that was before he knew I was sent there as a referral. He volunteered his assistance with selecting the proper bike for my wife, while allowing her to take a test drive, as well as ask him a dozen questions. He was helpful throughout, and allowed me to make my decision based not only on price (which was fantastic, no sticker shock) but also after learning about the options available as well as being treated the way a customer should be. I can't say enough about this place, and I'll be back when my kids are ready to upgrade their bikes.]
