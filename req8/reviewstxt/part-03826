[111708284713572934602,100359991484873843592,I found the Cleveland Eye Clinic just by chance, and I'm so happy I did. All the doctors there are the best and truly care about all your concerns, and work hard to resolve any problems with your eyes. The staff are very professional and are really friendly. You'll never regret going to the Cleveland Eye Clinic, it's a number one facility. If I had to rate it from a 1-10, it get a 10 plus! Marlene Conroy]
