[108573721573281526072,100355639039851281069,I have bought a lot of cars in my life. About 15-18 to be exact. This was the smoothest, fastest experience I have had so for. My credit was borderline and they got me a low rate and approved in literally minutes. Jorden and Mathew went above and beyond the call of duty. I cannot praise them enough putting me into my dream truck 1794 edition tundra. I went to Fred Haas prior and not only did Gullo beat their price 6,000 they also gave me 2,000 more for my trade in. And! a 1500 rebate!! WHAT A DIFFERENCE! They then went on to tell me I could get my extended warranty refunded. This was another 1800 in my pocket! Fred Haas said I had no warranty. Gullo has got it going on! The entire process was less than an hour.]
