[101858943996814457179,100398752462343070861,The worst service I've had anywhere in New Orleans. We went there on a Tuesday night and there were literally 4 customers in the dining room. There were also 4 employees. We were promptly seated, given chips, salsa, and menus. Then we were ignored by all of the staff for 15 minutes. We ended up walking out without anyone saying a word to us.]
