[101111426144310676241,101134870479463949398,These guys are the best! I called every auto shop in Jacksonville and Chris at Doug's Care Care was the only person who didn't just bark a price or question if they even wanted to work on my 1988 Fiero! He actually asked me questions about what was going on with my car. It turned out to be the clutch master and slave cylinder. Dougs Car Care save me over $300 dollars more than what the other shops quoted just to replace the clutch! They even keep me going with a loaner car! They have earned a customer for life!]
