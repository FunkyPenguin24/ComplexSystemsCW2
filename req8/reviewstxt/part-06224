[102024682917046507364,100488371813612892820,Fantastic service from the minute we walked in to our final departure. Check-in was fast and smooth. I stopped back by the front desk an hour after checking on a busy Saturday afternoon and Jeanne addressed me by my name! Our jacuzzi suite was very clean and roomy. At breakfast, we were asked three different times how our food was. I have to say it was delicious. Loved the location close to the Arch and Laclede's Landing. The beds were softer than we were used to but still slept well. We also liked how secure the hotel was. You could not leave the main floor, lobby area, or access the parking garage without swiping your room key. We are looking forward to making this our permanent resting place for our frequent travels to STL.]
