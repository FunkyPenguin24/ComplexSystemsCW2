[102458787772039767001,100356977276687987272,My husband has purchased several Hondas from Sheehy Honda and Bob Sautter has been his salesperson. He has always gone above and beyond the expected norm of purchasing a new Honda. He has always taken him to the service department to show him around and introduce him to the service writers. Rachel Higgins has always been our service writer. Both employees are top notch and are a credit to Sheehy Honda of Alexandria.]
