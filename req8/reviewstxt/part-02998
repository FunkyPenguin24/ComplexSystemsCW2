[106346137533822722161,100314612056820628174,I feel I was taken advantage of because I was in need of a new battery and luckily I was parked in front of the shop so I decided to be a mindful consumer and go to a local shop instead of a chain automotive shop. I regret my decision. I was charged for an hour of labor for them to make sure that, yes, the battery was the problem, and then they only sold one kind of battery- the most expensive kind- and then charged me another hour of labor to install it. $240 dollars for a new battery and I felt trapped into the situation.]
