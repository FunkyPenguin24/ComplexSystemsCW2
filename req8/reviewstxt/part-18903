[107665332330308948662,100001394559406184559,Although hard to find and not cheap, I loved my visit there. I have been looking for a place for manicures, pedicures, hair and makeup (for special occasions) for years. I found it!!!! I was going in to Kim Jew Photography to have professional head shots and action shots so I got the works. Allen did an amazing job of makeup for the photo session. It was pretty heavy and dark but came out perfectly for a natural but younger look. He also styled my hair and it looked amazing for the photo shoot. Bravo did a great job on the manicure and pedicure with natural products and no cutting of cuticles or callouses. I have had so many compliments on my french manicure that is more pearlescent than most harsh white ones. And my feet are happy and beautiful. If you don't mind paying a little more for quality, you will definitely get great services with natural products.]
