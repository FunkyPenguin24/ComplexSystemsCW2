[115869180282598042087,100044677690572041254,I went in loaded for bear. I have had problems with Sprint dropping calls. Stopped in to have them check my phone all was well. Went home called Sprint. They SAID that the problem was with the network and that the 2 towers that serviced mare that one was at 65% of power and the other was 45% of power. They stated that they would check into it and get back to me in no less than 3 days day 4 arrived i waited until late in the day and called them. gave them the run down and low and behold they wanted to do all the tests again . 1st my phone . which I told them I had checked out at the sprint store But it means nothing. Then they looked at my records and said for the 2nd time " yes you do have a lot of dropped calls" Then they started talking about service areas. I stated that I was in the service area per their map.. Oh she said. you have to go online and look.. what you maps are not correct? I saw nothing to say I needed to go online? after a few more minutes of them trying to blame my area and my house and my location I stated that they were out of contract as my service was minimum at best. they then moved me up the ladder. mmmm bout 5 minutes later another person on the phone ask me the same crap i had explained 3 times before.. i was going to blow chunks about now. Then she says oh I see you have a lot of dropped calls.. phunking wise woman. She then said that they would be happy to let me out of my contract as I was now on the EDGE of the service area and they could not give me the service that i was paying for..All I had to do was return the phone? What I said I bought they phone! I paid up front for the phone and the service and the phone belonged to me. Well long story short. Sprint SUCKS. They play little games when in fact they need to be honest sooner.]
