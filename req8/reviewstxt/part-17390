[109928374704107897786,101096976363569135974,For the past four months a group of men from my church have gone to The Lower Deck in Clayton Park for lunch on the second Wednesday of the month. It's been difficult to know in advance how many will show up, but, Gary, Matt and the staff there are very helpful and accomodating. We get all the tables together in the front room there and have a social gathering and conduct a bit of business. The guys keep wanting to go back so, back we go..... Everyone raves about the food, but we would like to see the Lunch Menu Specials changed up occasionally though.]
