[106889800960123949649,100724867050353052551,This is a very inconspicuous restaurant with excellent food. Make a reservation and be prepared to pay a little more for a meal that sets the standard for steak. We stumbled upon Red Gable while celebrating our anniversary in Saundusky. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates fine dining. The ambiance is very subtle, but relaxing. Service is terrific and again, the food is amazing. You won't be disappointed.]
