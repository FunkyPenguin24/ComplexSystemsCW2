[115707746019492389008,100778061523865454169,We had a really good experience with my boyfriend. We booked a private double room and was pretty new and neat. Toilets Cleanliness was very good too. Staff attention as well. Location is very central and good too, across the TV tower, easy to move around. Nice breakfast! IÂ´d definitely highly recommend it!]
