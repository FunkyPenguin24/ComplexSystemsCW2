[101818170383139637236,100951811120014964044,Our first visit to this dog park was wonderful. Our Barkley loved meeting all of the other dogs. We enjoyed ourselves. The facilities were nice, lots of water for the dogs and they supply the clean-up bags. There was plenty of room for running and they even had exercise equipment for the dogs. I love the fact that the park is free during the week as well.]
