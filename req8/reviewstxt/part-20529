[107243595012199361018,100087287341054292124,I love Dr. Heather Fox. She is a very capable, and concerned practitioner who is always looking out for your best interest. She does all her own work, including hygiene, and is always available for an emergency. With the most delicate touch in town, you won't even feel a pinch. Highly recommended.]
