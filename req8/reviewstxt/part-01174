[102404107306807546194,100220063281666868700,Man! I have been to this place for over 4 years and watched it grow. Now that they are serving food...which started as a take out only, has become a great place to dine in. The food was good then but now it is great and very delicious! I tell all my clients what I recommend for real Thai-Food and this is the one place that is close to me and easy to tell others how to get to it as well. Everything is reasonable price wise and you can't beat that from the other nasty fast food chains that are not fresh and healthy for you. If you know about Thailand and as it is called the third world country where poor people learn to survive...all the food is made fresh and very tasty. I love it for I have lived there for 8 years and know what I am talking about. Don't let me tell you about it...just go there yourself and see what it is about and taste the true Thai experience! Be very careful...very addicting and you will be BACK 100% sure of that! Pee Nan and Pee Pat are great at what they do and friendly as if you just walk through the doors back to Thailand. I miss Thailand but these ladies sure make me feel as if I am back there but only here in Port Charlotte, Florida. Keep up the great work ladies and many blessings to you all and the store that you have made it become.]
