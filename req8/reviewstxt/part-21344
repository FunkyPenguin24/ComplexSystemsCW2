[116101013559209110936,100131414241098296128,We bought a diagnostic ultrasound system from a company in UK. The system was well packed and delivered in time. Unfortunately we had a transport damage because the package dropped down. Phil and Kate were a really big help and helped us with the insurance company. Finally everything was solved and I really want to say thank you for all you have done. It was a great pleasure working with you and we will be happy working with Pack & Send soon.]
