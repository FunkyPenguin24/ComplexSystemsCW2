[105140321319994655357,100719812051256374967,We had been planning to install a hardwood floor for quite some time now, but somehow or the other the thing got postponed. This year my wife and me decided to put a little effort into our flooring venture and this is how we came across Floorlabor. During this time, we had contacted a few other providers also, but given the experience and the reasonable quote we decided to stick with Floorlabor. I am happy as they delivered more than my expectations, they did a good job, and we will surely hire their services for two other rooms we plan to hardwood next year.]
