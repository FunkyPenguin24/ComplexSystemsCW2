[107311012192134820804,100265170875228570637,Another warning to NEVER rent through Desert Wide Properties. From the very beginning of our lease they have been nothing but terrible. When we moved into our townhouse nothing had been cleaned and a number of things were broken. We complained but still had to clean/fix things ourselves. Over the last year and a half we have had several problems and never receive a response to our phone calls or emails. Our AC now went out and they had to order parts for it to be fixed so we'd be without AC overnight. We have a newborn baby and no family in the area so we asked if they'd pay for us to stay in a hotel. Their response was that because it currently was not over 100 degrees they would not as this was not inclement weather. It was over 100 during the day but by the evening it had dropped to the high 90's. Our home was also in the upper 90's. We have rented from several properties over the years and this is by far the worst.]
