[114035590657022570259,100299267077053522924,Loving the sales service of Mrs. Sara Love! The whole family at Norris Acura was very accommodating. They worked with my husband and me to attain a monthly payment plan within the constraints of our budget. They also found me a lower interest rate than the original 2.99 my bank offered. Sara's professionalism and easy-going attitude removed the stressful environment usually associated with that of a "pushy salesman." We found some minor issues with the SUV after we drove off the parking lot, but they immediately scheduled an appointment for us to come back and have them fixed. It was an easy process, and they gained a life-long customer.]
