[100040817964599272747,100918315584091781872,Absolutely fantastic! Not only do you get a fun, casual atmosphere, but the food is *amazing*, the drinks are a little too dangerous if you're not prepared, and even though we arrived on a crazy, busy Sunday night, we got a table right away and the owner even came by and checked on us to see how everything was. I normally only give 4 stars for a very good meal, but I was so impressed that this easily sits at one of my top 3 meals ever eaten. I'd recommend trying the shashimi sampler. I'm normally not a big sashimi eater, but everything was so fresh and amazing I am officially a convert. Thank you, Eatery! We will definitely be back!]
