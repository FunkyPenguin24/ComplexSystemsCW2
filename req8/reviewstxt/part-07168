[106388744336835843824,100541886316581162709,My wife and I moved into the community 8 years ago. We had been members of a Conservative synogogue for 30 years in the old neighborhood. Being contrarians wew bought a house 2 1/2 times larger than the old one even though are children were grown and out of our home. Our first item on our agenda was to find a synogogue to join. So we went synogogue shopping in our new community. Our needs were met by Shelter Rock Jewish Center. While keeping traditional values and Jewish Law it is also egtalitarian and constantly looking to apply these two valures to modernity and to the meet the needs of every member and to the community at large. I have studies with the rabbi of our synagogue for several years now and am constantly learning not just Jewish Law and Responsa but, Jewish history both ancient and modern. Our cantor and Rabbi make services a pleasure and the congregation actually sings rather than just observe. If you are looking for a place that will fulfill your needs for ruach and also teach and help you teach your children where they came from and where they are going as Jews, Shelter Rock is that place. P.S. I am not a member of the board and I am in no way affliated with the synogogue other than being a member]
