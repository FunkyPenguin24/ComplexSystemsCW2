[106758187409694193551,100526411765384206091,Buying a new or used car can be a stressful experience. I knew what I wanted, I know the year, make, model and options & features. I simply searched for the car and found it a Johnstons Toyota. I drove about and hour and 10 minutes to get there from my home in Hopatcong NJ. It was worth the trip. The entire staff was friendly and attentive, the dealership was clean and orderly and the price of the vehicle was fair. What more could a person ask for in a Car buying experience. I will return to Johnstons for service and another vehicle when the time comes.]
