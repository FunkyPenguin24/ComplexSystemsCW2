[102543017164268927703,100636081982493902801,I walked in to purchase a bouquet of flowers for my wife and after being initially greeted and attended to they ended up taking 20 minutes to put the flowers into an arrangement. No acknowledgment that the service was slow and they just ignored me the whole time I was in their store (with nowhere to sit down for the wait). Very impersonal and unprofessional. Upside was that my wife did like the flowers, but in the future I will get them elsewhere.]
