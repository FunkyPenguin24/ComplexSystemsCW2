[113338831504624934121,100806422378536752854,Stayed here for 4 days on memorial day weekend. The place was still getting some renovation work done. The room was in excellent shape but was still outgassing some of the adhesives. A quick spray with some febreeze knocked that down. Would definitely stay again.]
