[109063647347465533595,100685735688251152038,Visited after reading an article in Springfield News Leader printed in July 2013. Every bit as good as stated in the article. Tried to warn girlfriend how BIG the pancakes were pictured. She couldn't believe that the cakes would be as big as I described. Thankfully we both only ordered on each. Needless to say this may have been my first visit; it certainly won't be my last.]
