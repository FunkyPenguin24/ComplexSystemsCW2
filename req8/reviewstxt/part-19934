[101045946056058547312,100056341683256460380,This place is a joke. First, we were all excited about coming here with our boys to bowl and it started off with disappointment and confusion. We were assigned to a lane and had to change lanes because a group was coming in. They didn't show up while we were there. Then the group next to us was not reprimanded by the staff for standing in our lane, bumping into us, dropping food on our lane and trying to hit our pins. Then we tried to order food twice and the lady behind the counter was too busy to deal with us. I'm glad stars and strikes is opening soon and pray for improvement. Very much not happy. Such a shame.]
