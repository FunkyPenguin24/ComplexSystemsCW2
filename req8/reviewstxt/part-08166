[104493679702472240344,100596877339569975628,I've sailed with Asaad for over 20 years as a child and continue as an adult with friends and family. I have had a consistently wonderful experience on his boat, which is always well-maintained. He is very professional and a good conversationalist. Sunset cruises are always my favorite.]
