[100953635836043296778,100986803798057628768,Two issues. Don't count on them actually processing the form to automate your payments for a loan. I sent three separate forms to them, and I'm still having to manually pay them all the time. The second issue is their phone support. They have no where near the amount of people to answer calls in a timely manner. Be prepared to hear "we apologize for the delay" and "due to our heavy call volume" messages over 50 times each while waiting to talk to somebody. You may want to get a newspaper, watch a movie at your computer, or learn Japanese in the time it takes for someone to answer the phone.]
