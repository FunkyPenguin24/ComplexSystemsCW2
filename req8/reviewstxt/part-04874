[102276361850040836301,100417183946592380974,Just returned from a 7 day stay at Seven Gables. This is a WONDERFUL place to stay!!! Our family is use to staying at Embassy Suites & Hilton Gardens Inns so I was a little worried when this was the only hotel that could accomodate our 12 player baseball team and families. It didn't take long for me to realize that we were in good hands with Ms. Alice (the owner) taking care of us. Ms. Alice and Ms. Angie (an employee) go above and beyond what any hotel chain would do for you. The rooms are very clean, the pool area is wonderful for families and kids and we never ran out of hot water showering. The hotel office has a nice living room area with a big screen tv that is very inviting and Ms. Alice or Ms. Angie are aways in the office to greet you with their southern hospitality. If you are in the Somerset area, don't overlook this hotel!! It is a great place for a great price!! Thank You Seven Gables for making our trip to Kentucky so wonderful!!]
