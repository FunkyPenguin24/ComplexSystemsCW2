[102839508098795229528,100437505690985580640,Park Bar is a go-to neighborhood bar for the Union Square area. It's pretty small and intimate so it's good for after work or after dinner drinks. It's a good place if you want to actually talk to the people you're going out with (as opposed to a louder, darker downtown bar).]
