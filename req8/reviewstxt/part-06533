[118285980194074228146,100506316246819198682,This wasn't the greatest experience. Was sold something that had aftermarket DVD after being told it included factory installed. On top of that I spoke with the GM and was expecting a phone call on options to resolve this situation. I called the day after and was told he would call me back. I haven't heard anything from them and feel this place is very shady.]
