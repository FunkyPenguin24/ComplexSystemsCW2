[112137968903155931695,100547064481057710256,I originally discovered Ex Libris at Renegade Craft Fair's store in Chicago. I love, love, love their journals, especially the ones made from vintage craft books. I love that the pages are unlined and that some of the original pages from the books are often interspersed among the blank pages. They're what I use to brainstorm DIY ideas. The unlined pages are the perfect canvas for it. :)]
