[107527892627816722391,100764051593808333597,The guide books highly recommend this place and say it costs 16.50 TL but when I went, they insisted on 30 TL (tourist rate I guess). This was supposed to include a massage. I've never been to a Turkish bath before so I didn't know what to expect. She did give me a "massage" for about 1 minute during the washing. When I shared my experience with my hosts, they informed me that I was ripped off and the massage is usually about 30 min. Beware or go with a Turkish speaker.]
