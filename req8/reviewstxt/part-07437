[101188014527024736793,100556758549323937913,My Name is Erin. I am currently living in knight's circle and I HATE IT! No one that they've got employed in the front offices can answer any of the questions that i have, they constantly have people coming in and out of my apartment for various reasons. In the 4 months i have lived here my toilet has broken twice (by leaking) and flooded my room after the problem was supposedly fixed. Our stove spontaneously sparked and blew out while we were only trying to make dinner. Our ice maker broke and flooded our entire kitchen, for which we had to listen to a large loud fan for a week when they said they'd have it out the very next day. I was also very disappointed that when i moved in, my apartment was NOTHING like the apartment that i toured (i know they're made to look nicer, but i wasn't expecting hideous torn up couches and chairs. I can say that maintenance are rather fast at responding to problems, but they are problems we shouldn't have in the first place. All in all, the bad outways the good and i am not at all impressed.]
