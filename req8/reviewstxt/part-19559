[101577709990338691090,100036296147781081780,I had called around to a few places to have the wheel bearing replaced on my Honda. This place had the best price and the owner personally spoke with me on the phone and made me feel very comfortable. I asked him to also see if other things need to be done like the spark plugs or transmission fluid. Him and his mechanic personally picked up the vehicle from my workplace. They called me a few hours later and showed me pictures of the wheel bearing via text message and replaced it. They informed me that the vehicle did not need transmission fluid replaced until the care was at 110,000 miles and spark plugs could wait until then as well. I think that is very honest of them to not oversell me on doing other work. They dropped my car off at my work place a few hours later and had the car washed. They even brought me the old wheel bearing to show me what was wrong with it. I am not sure about the other reviews on here, but they may be local competitors who are posting negative reviews. I will be going here for all me future auto needs.]
