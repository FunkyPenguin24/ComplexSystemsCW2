[104685274018862690041,101087285331696082451,Usually the service is pretty decent but the last time I went the service was bad. I ordered the lunch special because I wanted takeout they decided I could not have the soup. I asked was it the same price and they told me yes. When I asked to see a manager, I got a lot of disgusted faces and rude excuses. I love hibachi and loved the proximity to my home but as a person who routinely spends 50+ for 2 ppl. I'd rather go somewhere my patronage is appreciated.]
