[107462306097995453664,100160117588977146498,The worst dealer ever! The only thing they care about is your MONEY, they don't respect you as a customer. I went there to buy a corolla ascent and a man with a long beard told me he wouldn't give me a quote unless I promise them to buy the car from them. He told me it was a WASTE of his time to give me a price if I didn't buy the car from them. I hated the way they treated me and bought my car from another dealer.]
