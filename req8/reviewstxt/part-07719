[106430756407185996256,100572167244849594948,Shopping for a vehicle at Crown VW was a breath of fresh air. As another reviewer mentioned, Sean is fantastic to work with. He put the utmost effort into ensuring I found a car that met my needs and didn't try to push me into something unnecessary. I worked with several other car dealers in Kansas City and Omaha looking for a car, but I wish I would have just stayed in town all along. Sean and Crown can't be beat.]
