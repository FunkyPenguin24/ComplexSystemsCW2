[107136966481974240096,100147266268769357721,We attanded a family 80th Birthday celebration for Sunday carvery for which we were kindly allowed to gather in a private room with a bar before eating. There were 4 bar staff in attendance and the public side must have received excellent service as I waited for at least 10 minutes before I was asked what I would like to drink. The carvery itself was the typical buffet arrangement and consisted of over-cooked tough beef, nicely cooked pork and a rolled turkey joint which was moist. Vegetables on offer were very ordinary roast potatoes ranging from dark brown and overcooked to beige and underdone to cater for everyone's taste, cauliflower that re-invented the term 'al dente' as they required a firm hand with a steak knife to disect them. The carrots were similarly prepared to the cauliflower as was another vegetable of unknown botanical origin. The cabbage was, in contrast, cooked to perfection; and the mandatory frozen peas and sweet corn were also available with a pot of viscous gravy. The dessert menu was presented after the main course and orders taken. I cannot comment upon the vanilla and maple cheesecake ordered as it failed to arrive, but the apple and rhubarb crumble was extremely skimped on the rhubarb and crumble whilst the apple had the appearance and firmness of apples that had been heated but certainly not baked as would normally be expected. Special mention needs to be made of the strawberries used to garnish some of the desserts, they were of unusual colour being the normal colouring on the lower half whilst the top were completely colourless. A nice final touch was the lack of coffee offered.]
