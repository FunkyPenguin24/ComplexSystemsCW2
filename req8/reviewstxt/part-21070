[107625575969087921222,100116615083084929663,6-3-13 My name is Will and I ended up purchasing a nearly new 2012 Jeep Rubicon Unlimited from Crown this past Friday. I located the Jeep via Autotrader and drove up to Dublin OH from Hopkinsville KY. Their price on the Jeep was better than anything I could find within 500 miles of my zip code. The BEST part of my experience outside of purchasing the Jeep itself was the salesperson that helped me. Kathy Moyer was / is the best car salesperson that I have met, and I have purchased many cars both individually and through my company over the past 15 years. From the minute I arrived, she had thoroughly investigated the Jeep that I was buying and was prepared to show me every feature of the vehicle. If you are looking for a Jeep in particular, Kathy is your girl. She has actually owned her own Jeep building shop in the past and drives a Jeep Wrangler herself. Honesty is #1 for me, and there is a perception in the car sales industry that there are many crooked people out there, and I believe in many cases rightfully so. Not with Kathy!!! Kathy prepared my paperwork at the price we had negotiated over the phone. She didn't try to "up-sell me or haggle over the price". She also handled everything for me before sending me to the finance manager for final paperwork. I honestly can't say enough good about her. I have written very few reviews of businesses or individuals in my life, but in this case I feel like it is the least I can do. THANK YOU Kathy and thank you Crown for a GREAT experience. Will]
