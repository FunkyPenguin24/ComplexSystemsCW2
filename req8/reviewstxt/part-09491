[111703782294219955068,100665673624166635428,In an ocean of chain restaurants, drive-thru dinners and uninspired entrees, a local restaurant run by local people supporting local breweries is and always will be a welcome diversion. Great care has gone into selecting the finest in local ales and brews of which the owners and staff will be more than happy to share the history and the subtleties of each one. The food is divine. They specialize in gourmet pizzas; wonderful, fresh toppings and unique arrangements sitting atop a homemade sauce and crust that has their own beer as a main ingredient. I highly recommend their Gourmet Goat pizza: goat cheese and buffalo mozzarella topped with spinach, red onion and fresh tomato. A pizza so sublime that it has firmly planted itself as one of my all time great indulgences. Come for the pizza, stay for the beer. Please do yourself a favor and support this fine local business and don't forget to "Drink Like a Local".]
