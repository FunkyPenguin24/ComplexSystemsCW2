[106705249703128331032,100847987081494889286,bad reviews dont lie!! the OWNER of this place came to my house to fix water damage after a flood. they ended up doing a total reno on my master bathroom. the job isn't finished, all the tile has to be torn down and rebuilt. and they missed 3 deadlines and want extra money or else they are putting a lien on my house. i wish i saw these reviews before i hired them, all this could have been avoided. if these people come to your house, LOCK YOUR DOORS and call someone else.]
