[101315434627916036547,100666581667630708440,I purchased my MacBook at this store in April and am already experiencing tech issues with track pad. I called to get some questions answered and before I could tell them what the problem was they transferred me to an automated Apple Care teller that took me through several minutes of questions then said "number invalid" and hung up. I called back, spoke to the same person and he, with as little interest as he could muster, told me I needed to schedule an appointment. As a first time Mac user, I needed a few basic things answered though it's obvious they have to ensure you are the owner of the machine or they are not allowed to help you. I've still not received help for my computer that I just bought in that store. Disappointing to say the least.]
