[101047473196441379989,100151049395734162062,Mr. Long and his staff are some of the most professional and courteous people I have ever had the honor of working with. I have worked with several attorneys in the Craven County area regarding my particular case. When my attorney passed away in the middle of my custody case, and after 2 years of the case being prolonged by other parties, Mr. Long's firm took on the case and it was resolved in a matter of weeks. Just when I had lost faith in the system, Mr. Steven Long showed me that it can work. An attorney that not only has experience, but cares about and believes in his clients is key when dealing with the Craven County court system. If you are looking for the best, look no further.]
