The waiter was rude and the food was served incorrectly so that most of the table had finished their main course before others were served. In the end, we had to wait so long that that the delay meant that the place closed before they served dessert! When we asked for the dessert menu we were told that we had run out of time and we had to leave. What a shame because the food was really good.]
