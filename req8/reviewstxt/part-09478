[100322882359401800046,100665045735717028723,HORRIBLE place - dont have your party here ever. The staff was totally rude - the waitress constantly harassed my whole party. They charged me $100 deposit for the party that they told me I would have bottle service- the bottle I never got - then charged me $120 the next day on my card when $100 cash was given in person at the beggining of the party. They also moved my whole party into an area full of stacked chairs and tables saying another party was coming to share my space with me and they never came. I also walked thru the door way to go out to smoking 3 times and the door was open (also with two security gaurds at it) the 4th time the all glass door with no writing was closed and I walked right into it busting open my forehead neither gaurds asked if i was okay - completely unsafe not to mention all the water ALL over the place on the floor with no one to clean it up. I will never return here or reccommend it to anyone. This place is a joke and it ruined my birthday.]
