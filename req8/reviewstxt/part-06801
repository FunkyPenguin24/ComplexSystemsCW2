[102844178991091885499,100522236121104249241,I bought my Sony NEX Camera from Leederville Camera House a few weeks ago and I was so impressed with the service from Lidio and staff. Walked in to a smiling array of staff all happy to help, but never pushy! I will certainly return for Photo Printing services and am currently saving for my waterproof casing for the camera mentioned above. Highly suggest this camera store for all your camera needs, be it just for accessories, or a camera itself. Great range too!]
