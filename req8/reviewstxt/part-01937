[100513090853294851713,100259000054761022015,TERRIBLE! Go somewhere else! Took my mother there for hearing tests and a hearing aid. Apparently the owner is Mark Walser who has a reputation for being "cheap" and not fully disclosing information that would affect your decision on purchasing a particular hearing aid from them. The hearing aids are overpriced and you get "nickled and dimed" on other smaller charges. The place is run more like a business than it is to help people with hearing difficulties. We went to another hearing center and received the same hearing aid for 2/3 the price and dealt with people who without a doubt are more caring and, in my opinion, more honest.]
