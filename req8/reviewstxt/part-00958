[112389074766774632436,100208812566556015087,Our experience at Faulkner Mazda has left absolutely nothing to be desired. The experience was simple, quick and enjoyable. From the politeness of the staff to the quality of the product, Faulkner Mazda has covered all of their bases. The quality of the product is obvious and was explained in depth by our sales person Mike Ramsey and Mark Eager. We were presented with the best possible situation to meet our family and financial needs and we left the dealership in a much better financial position than we came in with. The finance manager, I believe her name was Amanda, was very thorough and helpful, and everyone helped to create a very non-pressuring environment. The deal that we received was exceptional and the additional finance help that we received was greatly appreciated, especially during the holidays! Thank you for your hospitality and positive interaction to everyone that we came in contact with at Faulkner Mazda! My wife and I are both proud owners of Mazdas and we plan to be a part of the Faulkner Mazda family for years to come!]
