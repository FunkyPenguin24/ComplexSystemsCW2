[100389942518821300987,101097095876495779395,Great Bar & Grille restaurant. The food always good, I'm so surprised that people have not posted many reviews but then again always full seems like locals. The servers are quick and seem to watch if you need something. They have from steaks, burgers, wings and much of any type of good food you are looking to eat. Here in Avon, Oh stop in and have some great food, fun and spirit.]
