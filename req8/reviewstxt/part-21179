[108380197877801917590,100122048987327822582,My wife and I moved from Washington, DC to Ann Arbor. With only two weekend visits the Toth Team helped us find a great house in a tight market. They were extremely responsive throughout and made the process quite easy, even setting up a long-distance closing so that we didn't have to fly in just to sign documents. Overall it was excellent service from the whole team.]
