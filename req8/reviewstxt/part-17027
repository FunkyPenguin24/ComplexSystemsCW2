[107246624002136304672,101077186468518816125,Sweet 16! An exciting adventure for Haley's 16th birthday morning! She loved it and was so comfortable with Denise as "her co-pilot"! She actually took control and flew the ultra-light down the coast and back. She had a wonderful time and we are sharing the photos and DVD for everyone to see. Thank you, Sandra]
