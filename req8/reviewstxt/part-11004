[102109869576895563508,100748260502688280767,I've lived here for 40 years and that was the best piece of fish I ever had. My girlfriend had the shitome and it was excellent. My daughter had the mahi mahi, and it was even better. probably the best mahi mahi I've had, I had the pistachio crusted opah, on a bed of tasty bulgar wheat and it was incredible. We didn't have to wait a long time for it either.]
