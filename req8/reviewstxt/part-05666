[102071939246192108901,100459562519788676238,I love the glen but not the food. Never rate this low before. The dipping sauce so sweet, should call this place Jardinia Uno.. The dipping sauce so sweet it can be used for pizza sauce. Asked for sliced jalape√±o, it even taste like green papers. Used come to this place a couple year ago and the owner used to give me original souce which very spicy and original. I just can't shake it..even Italian place,Bravo, 2 block down has spicier calamary sauce..]
