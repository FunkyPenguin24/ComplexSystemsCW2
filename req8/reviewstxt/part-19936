[103127501971002567464,100056518083609406505,On the 18th of June 2012, my wife and I had to go to Hutchinson for some personal matters. And, as we were en route to leave for home (which is roughly 80 miles or so from Hutchinson), I caught a glimpse of a place I had never seen before in all my visits (and even previous residence) to the town. It was a little hole in the wall store in Hutchinson's antique store district on East Main Street, known as Toy Depot. To be honest, I really didn't know what to expect and actually considered passing it up because too often have I been left disappointed by stores that say they are toy stores and are full of things to educate children, which I don't necessarily find anything wrong. But, as a toy collector myself, the last thing I want to add (and, really never add) is Dora the Explorer, Thomas the Tank Engine, or Bob the Builder. That said, I gave Toy Depot a look and from the second I walked in, I was taken back in time to my childhood during the late 70s and throughout the 80s. Granted, I didn't see Transformers, but I did see all sorts of toys I had once played with. Money, unfortunately, didn't permit any purchases to be made sadly, but I was very pleased not only with their selection but the prices were equally awesome. When next I get a chance to go back to Hutchinson, Toy Depot will definitely be one of my stops and this time, I'll make sure to have a little extra cash to spend.]
