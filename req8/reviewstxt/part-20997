[114109085909433807946,100112449679181654762,We had our wedding at Spring Lake in October 2012 and we loved everything about the venue. Working with Renty was AMAZING, as she was very hands-on and ready to answer all of my many questions. It was almost a 2 hour drive from my house and I only visited the venue twice before the wedding, so I relied on Renty a lot to help me visualize the space, as I was doing all of the planning myself. She did not disappoint and I always felt like her suggestions and guidance were spot-on! I used almost all of her preferred vendors and they were all professional and the quality of their services was top of the line. I felt like their prices were incredible and every penny I spent was well worth it. My photographers (from out of town) LOVED the site and they shoot weddings all over the country, which is a testament to how truly unique and beautiful Spring Lake is. It is the perfect location if you're looking for southern, vintage, elegance, charm. Everyone who attended our wedding couldn't believe how gorgeous the place is--it's like a hidden gem!!! I recommend this venue to anyone and everyone who is considering it! Even if it is far from you, IT IS WORTH THE DRIVE. There is nothing I would change about our wedding at Spring Lake.]
