[100188441293890720413,100718818556131323253,Though I do not train at Goshin, or even live locally to partake in all of the wonderful things they do, I do interact with Mr Boggs quite often. I am a martial arts instructor, as well, and one of the dangers of our business is that we tend to run ourselves ragged, giving of our time and attention to everyone but ourselves. When it comes time for me to fill my tank, I often look to my fellow martial artists, who understand everything I am going through, and Mr Boggs is one of the most inspirational people I have met in martial arts community. He is fair, open minded, creative, receptive, and productive; all of the traits an excellent instructor should possess. Though I am thousands of miles away, I have no qualms about recommending Mr. Boggs and Goshin Karate & Judo Academy, as I can only imagine that the personal interaction of a student's experience would far outweigh even the great benefits I receive in the digital world each day.]
