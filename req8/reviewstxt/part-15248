[117193475938878111168,100979650778258813360,I completed my homework in the hopes I could cut my overly high monthly car payments. I did my research online and checked many dealerships. I noted a vehicle which matched my needs and desire. That vehicle, a 2013 Rock Lobster red Jeep Wrangler was also being sold at an internet price over $2200.00 less that the regular sale price. I brought in my vehicle for trade in and was quite surprised with the price I was offered. The whole process was started and completed in about two hours and I made signifigant savings on my monthly payments. I have desired a Jeep for some time adn am extremely pleased with the one I purchased and with the service and how I was handled.]
