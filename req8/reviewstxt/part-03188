[100224907927937430720,100323275685971424160,Park is OK, but pricing is a complete rip off for the area and the fact it's also a fair way out of town and there is nothing around it (ie decent shops / restaurants). Asked for the cheapest back-in full hookup site (22ft motorhome) and they wanted over $50 a night. And this is in winter. Ridiculous considering most parks in the area are $20 to $30 per night. As it was late, ended up geting water /elec site only, but still set me back $45. Was planning to stay 4 nights, now just staying one and will find a more reasonably priced campground. Put it this way, I paid less for a site at the KOA that is right on the Las Vegas Strip. And that's the most I've every paid for a RV site.]
