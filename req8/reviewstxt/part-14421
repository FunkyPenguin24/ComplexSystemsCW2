[108251000927515646267,100935764359162527290,My 3 year old son has had his teeth cleaned and checked twice at Alleman Family Dental. The fist time with Rebecca and Dr. Brecklynn and today with Michele and Dr. Dan. Both visits went very well. Everyone was patient with my son's questions and took the time to explain what was going to happen. Rebecca was great with his first visit telling him each thing she was going to do before doing it and letting him feel the tools on his hand before using them in his mouth.]
