[112351737190093200578,100970685701548368770,Didn't fix it! I am giving them two stars because their staff is extremely friendly and polite, albeit lacking a bit in communication. We ended up having to call them about four times to find out any news on our car, and then in the end, it wasn't really fixed. It seemed really busy every time we went in or called, and we think that maybe they weren't able to give the amount of attention needed to find the problem. Overall, we probably won't go back there for maintenance.]
