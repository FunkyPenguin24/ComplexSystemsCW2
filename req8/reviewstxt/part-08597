[103439896270839008141,100617866311522769856,Took my girlfriend to Westside this morning, she was complaining of severe abdominal pain. Was treated okay, they did an ultrasound (vaginal) which she said was very uncomfortable. After they reviewed the results, they transferred her to Plantation General - stating they had to transfer her because they had no OBGYN there to perform the laproscopic surgery on her. Why surgery? They diagnosed her as have a vaginal torsion which requires surgery to fix or remove (if necessary). So we go over to Plantation where they tell us they want to do their own vaginal ultrasound - stating they have better techs and staff then Westside does. I figured they just wanted to work the system because we have insurance. My girlfriend wasn't happy about going through the procedure 2x within 4 hours, but she did agree and she came through like a trooper. So, we were wondering why it was taking so long for the surgery, when finally Dr. Tombeck came in and told us that there was no vaginal torsion, it was a ruptured cyst and it would heal itself in some time. Westside? You should fire your ultrasound techs and radiologists who had anything to do with this grossly deficient diagnosis. I travel to this area often, and will tell any and all persons willing to listen how Westside botched a simple test - and Plantation obviously knows it becuase they told us they were doing a second test because of Westside's poor history.]
