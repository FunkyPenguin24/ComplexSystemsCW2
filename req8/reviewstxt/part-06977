[117980046825932168225,100531989297457073437,I will never eat there again! I called to make a reservation for 10 people and received an attitude from the female who answered the phone and the same after requesting the manager. It seamed like I was an inconvenience by calling ahead to advise that 9 adults and a 10 month old baby would be eating there. Too bad because we frequented the place since it opened. They must not need business.]
