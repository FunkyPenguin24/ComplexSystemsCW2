[113385382367271249641,100436869862248535540,Don't bother. Received a gift certificate to this place as a Christmas gift, found it in my purse and decided to finally use it only to find it had expired two days before. Went in to see if they'd honor it anyway. "Nope, we can't honor it" Can we say totally poor customer service? Rather than win a customer for life by honoring it, and a great tip for one of their employees, they blew me off and lost me as a customer and anyone and everyone I can tell not to go there. They probably don't care at all, they got their cash up front. Sad sad sad.]
