[104344769395975394184,100496675494817812825,Even though this is supposed to be the same as the original Fresh Air BBQ in Jackson, GA, it is by far not even close. There is a major difference in the taste of the sauce and even more of a difference in the taste of the stew and cole slaw. It's ok if you just want bbq, but if you want the absolute BEST bbq from Fresh Air, drive the extra 45 minutes to go to the original in Jackson, it's much better!]
