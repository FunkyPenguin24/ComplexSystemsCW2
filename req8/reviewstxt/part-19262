[106010291833492344925,100019942556083401937,I was in London last weekend, during my trip my camera broke. After checking the nearest store to our Hotel, my partner and I visited Currys in High Street Kensington. The service I received was second to none, I was welcomed by a lovely gentleman who directed me to the customer service desk. Steve the assistant asked me if I had replacement insurance cover for my 'existing broken camera' which I was unsure of. He went out of his way to check this. He very kindly advised this was all in place, furthermore took time to show me the camera that would be most suitable. I left the store with a brand new camera and copy certificate of insurance (which is effective for another 2 years.) A very very happy customer, thanks to a great team. Linda Fox]
