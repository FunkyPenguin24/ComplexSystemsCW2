[100438950395461465495,100072221134743669076,South Bay Wellness is an amazing, warm, welcoming center. They have the best holistic services on Long Island. I did Physical Therapy and MFR services there and since then I feel like a new person. My knee injury is healing so well. I also look to them for my holiday gifts for both Christmas and Valentines Day this year. They have some great all natural beauty products , the face serum is the best, leaves my skin so soft and smooth! Love this place. Alyson and Danielle the owners are such passionate, professional, and knowledgeable professionals. I would recommend South Bay to everyone in Suffolk County looking for help, or even just a relaxing spa day!]
