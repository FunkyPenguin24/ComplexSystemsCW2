[101580686046518278350,100843963539579554393,This is a dirty old pub that we go to with our coworkers for an inexpensive fast sit-down meal. It is also good for 5a7 as the beer is decent. If you're looking for healthy food, this is not the place! (then, go to CDL club next door, they have health food.) So the beer here is good and good price. For food, there are certain choices you should steer clear from - like the Steerburger, it has been known to be undercooked and questionable. If you're going burger, ALWAYS order the Royal burger (btw, menu photos on Urbanspoon are out of date, the menu is surprisingly still the same or almost, but the prices are not. The Royal is 3 bucks more, for example). The fries are greasy but delicious. The rest of the menu is okay (i've tried the fish and chips and the tourtiere), but know this is a worker's pub, hopping at lunch and 4pm only (happy hour), so if you are a tourist, only go here if you're looking for greasy highway-stop food, and a heavy-belly + stomach ache afterwards! Enjoy!]
