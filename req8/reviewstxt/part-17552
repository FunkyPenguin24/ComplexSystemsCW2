[102789243046174472252,101106076144732049944,The WORST Brighton has to offer! I met my now boyfriend there on a Saturday in 2012 for our first date. It was NCAA Basketball time so I gave the horrible service and overcooked food a free pass that night because the place was so busy. Well, for our 1.5 year anniversary in August of 2013 we decided to give it another try. The place was pretty empty and we were still overlooked by our waitress. We ordered cheese sticks as an appetizer and received them without silverware, plates or napkins. I tried making eye contact with her...no avail. I even sat sideways in our booth trying to get her attention...nothing! I finally went up to the bar and asked if it was self serve for the items needed. To my surprise the waitress says "yeah, go ahead". I had to go BEHIND the bar to get what we needed and they couldn't of cared less! That's really bad service...and no one was in the place. BUT...there were 2 groups of "regulars" who got everything they wanted easily. I actually found my waitress sitting with them at one point. Dinner came and my broasted chicken was dry...but there was no returning it because the waitress never came back! We had to go to the bar to get more beer, too. Boyfriends chicken fingers were something from McDonald's...except they were $9.99! We will never go back.]
