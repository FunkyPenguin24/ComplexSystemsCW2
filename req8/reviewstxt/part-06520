[108478609212726358269,100505656944723525332,I ordered a complete set of furniture, and received 80% of my set. I was told the chaise lounge would be delivered the following week. It's been 3 weeks & still no chaise! When I called, I was told that "I just have to wait" even though I have already paid! Rude customer service that professes carelessness about dissatisfied customers. BUYER BEWARE!]
