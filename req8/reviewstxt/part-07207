[115594144766447264718,100543526687734560873,Called Nana's Pet Sitting in mid July to schedule a pet sitter for our two cats for Labor Day weekend; left a voice mail message. Five days later, no one had called me back, so I tried again, on a Monday. This time I spoke to the owner, Linda. She sounded rushed and tired. She said that she had just hired three new sitters, but was still very understaffed, and also said that she had been working 12-16 hours a day to keep the business afloat. She said that my name was on her desk to be called back later that day, or the next day. At the end of the conversation she said "If I don't call you back by Thursday, call again." I am not about to chase someone down to get their business. I went with the next business on my list, called Pampered Paws. This time I got a friendly owner who drove out to my house for a free consult and to meet our cats. I would not recommend Nana's unless the owner gets her act together in the future and follows up with potential customers.]
