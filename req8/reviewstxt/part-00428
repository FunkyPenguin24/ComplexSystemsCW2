[102635672849395876218,100181018732817839360,The restaurant was small, but festively decorated and had a fun atmostphere. The service was terrific. And the tacos are only $1 each on Taco Thursdays! I highly recommend the Tacos al Pastor; they were the most delicious and authentic Mexican food I've had in months. And the margeritas on the rocks were cheaper and tastier than most other Mexican restaurants--it tasted like the real thing, rather than processed margerita mix. Had an awesome time!]
