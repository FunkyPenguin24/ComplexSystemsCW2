[116925383226970627852,101139936071474386014,I went to Duval Honda to see the new Civic. I was pleased with what they offered in stock. Mindy came out to answer my questions. We went ahead and did an appraisal on my trade in. I got with Tom on some additional options for my car. I signed a contract and purchased my new car. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable. I now have a great car and a great dealer.]
