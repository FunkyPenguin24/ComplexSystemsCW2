[100337098956086661202,100672160814352360877,The Moore College of Art Alumnae Association needed a last minute logo created for a branding initiative, on a zero-budget. We had a name but not an idea of what it should look like. Quynh donated her services and creative expertise to create an exciting, concise logo for our alumnae initiative. She was quick to respond to feedback on her work and made changes to achieve a final product with hardly any turn-around time (minutes; really!).]
