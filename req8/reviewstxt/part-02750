[113750264944041582515,100300761141727385573,This place is horrible but always has lots of guests for some reason. I had a bad experience there but decided to give it another shot. the food is all room temperature and the rice literally taste like they recycle it from peoples finished plates. The staff is nice but seem oddly shady and nonchalant. I love chinese but hat this place...YUCK]
