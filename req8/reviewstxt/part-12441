[100961544996701604946,100825388639533353983,Hotel staff always friendly. The ping pong bar is very nice. The rooftop bar has the best view in downtown LA. The djs in both bars are outstanding. The ground floor lounge usually has live singers on Thursday nights and you can always get pretty good food at the restaurant which has an outside patio for dining. Want to chill in your room for the night? No worries, room service is quick and friendly. I've stayed here 4 times on business trips and will always stay here when in LA!]
