[106622322465487508268,100170374325494536518,I agree with Gwilym - this feels like the lounge away from home. Music, coffee, food and staff all great. C1 has something a little extra, which is hard to define but which makes you feel comfortable and welcomed. A great place to hang out for breakfast on the weekend]
