[100320313131418796136,101145514351450906178,Competitive prices compared to Best Buy for repairs. The staff was SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY! They were willing to spend the time to understand that spending a ton of money wasn't an option for me. After showing me their NO CREDIT CHECK payment option I was sold and will keep coming back! THEY HAVE GREAT DEALS ON USED TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS!]
