[102513439474902794751,100488626940379715938,Had a package shipped to me, from a supplier that I've purchased from before, with no issues. However, the package tracking showed it was delivered, and it was not. After making a call to USPS customer service and UPS (as they were the original shipper before it was handed off to USPS), I called the local post office after getting many different answers saying things from, "we made a report and we'll contact you after we investigate it" which never happened, and "The package shows it's at the post office". But still, the tracking number showed it was "Delivered". So I went to the post office and sure enough, it was there. Why would they keep the tracking for the package showing delivered if they had it in house at their facility?!? I believe the carrier for it was a moron, saw the UPS shipping label which showed the post office address, and thought it was a package for the post office, when ACTUALLY the label BELOW it which has USPS's own label, that it was supposed to go to my apartment. Re-delivery was never attempted. It was a week later when I finally retrieved it. There wasn't even a signature required. I've come to the realization that government employees are a bunch of morons (less teachers, they are generally not). Plus the lady at the counter was short tempered with me even though I was being NICE and SINCERE when dealing with such a STUPID business. They have one job; to deliver mail. And they can't even do it right. I wonder what else of mine is sitting in there I'm unaware of that doesn't have tracking on it........ I will never know.]
