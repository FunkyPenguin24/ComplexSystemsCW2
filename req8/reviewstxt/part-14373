After eating we complained to the manager about the service and he behaved like he did not understand english and could not help us. We asked to speak to the general manager of the store he refused and then proceeded to call a lady who spoke to us and agreed that the servers and the manager had done nothing wrong so me and my friend decided not to pay for the service. The manager got annoyed and started running after us yelling and cursing at us. I will never go back to this place it is very over priced and the service and embarrasment was not worth it.]
