[109974510355745493659,100658845159616638525,Murphy Road Animal Hospital was the place I chose after a lot of research upon adopting my dog Jack last year. The reviews were all very good, the only negative thing written was that their pricing is a bit too high--this however I did not believe to be true in my visits. In my personal experience I have felt that they give some of the best care, are ready to answer any questions I have, and have good pricing. When I first adopted Jack, I was still in college and on a tight budget, however, they were willing to help spell out the different costs and they all were reasonable. As a new dog owner, I felt that they really took the time to take good care of my dog and answer any questions/concerns I had. They are very involved with making sure we make it to all our checkups and shots, and they also send out a few emails a year reminding us helpful things about different holidays and seasons. I would HIGHLY recommend this vet for any and all pet lovers in the Nashville area.]
