[116928408977428442646,100153283852896098194,I am positively addicted to the taco salad with shrimp and the mango salsa. And, yet, everything I've tried is really good too. The service is always exceptional and the prices are comparable to Chipotle and/or Qdoba and taste much more unique at this point. I say, "go!" and go often.]
