[113038693438989367274,100808900995688577408,I just had my back glass replaced by Ideal Auto Glass and i'm so glad i did. These guys are amazing. They cleaned the front and the back of my car out!! All i did was drop my car off at 9am at their shop in Richfield and 3 hours later it was done. I couldn't ask for anything better.. Thanks guys Nick R~]
