[106950432726407040895,100653334338704112533,OK, everyone is entitled to a mistake once in awhile....and I am not saying Fox Honda has not made any BUT I am extremely satisfied with their service before, during and after the sale of a car. I have bought 5 cars from them just for my wife and I. So just from that statement it will tell you that I am a loyal customer. Thanks to Jack (who has retired), Russell (who has taken his place), Scott (the GM) and Vince from service. All A+ guys.]
