[104834647038851543977,100999543816082532915,Stayed here on a business trip. Best rate for a 3 star hotel in town. Friendly staff and clean rooms too. The place is so new it doesn't show up on google maps. The breakfast buffet is pretty good. All the normal stuff but also eggs and potatoes. Super comfy beds and pillows too. Highly recommended.]
