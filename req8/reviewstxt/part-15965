[108181946640398535217,101018919315585707094,Service work is expensive. $110 for a tire rod? At auto zone the part was $15. I came in for a routine oil change for $30. After the oil change they performed a curiosity check. They give me a list of problems with total over $800. The tire rod was the most expensive but I found it cheaper at auto zone. Did some research on YouTube, and I personally repaired 3/4 issues with my Enlantra for under $150!]
