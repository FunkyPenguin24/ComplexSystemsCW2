[102200224901398851268,100428410970571183953,I have worked at Team Kia of El Cajon since Dec. 2012, and I can say with confidence that this is the best Store I have worked at in 15+ years in the Car Industry. We recently went thru a major remodel that just finished about a month and a half ago and the building looks great! While going thru this remodel, we had to work in a small building with no A/C this entire last summer, but we still did very well because of the hot Kia product and a solid core management team led by our GM Chris George. With that being said, I do firmly and respectfully recommend Team Kia of El Cajon for anyone in the market for a quality product, respect for your time, fair pricing, happy employees and a great service drive (parts too). You can expect a smooth, easy experience here because any manager here, myself included, is empowered to assist you in any way needed to further your satisfaction to a positive conclusion. Our approach to our customers is one of eCommerce rather than that of other Stores that still employ the standards of old that few have the patience for in today's fast paced society. From one happy manager, Danny Schmidt Director of eCommerce]
