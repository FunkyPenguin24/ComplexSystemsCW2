[112850216424062850137,100156840699685893637,I love Chipotle. Their food is great quality, and they give you a generous portion. When i first started to go to Chipotle, the portion sizes were slightly larger because they gave you more meat. I always get the burrito bowl, and the food used to make a small mountain that they would have to crush when they put on the lid. Nowadays the mountain is pretty much level with the rim of the bowl. But it's still enough to feed you. And as for the lines, i can see why they're so long. What Chipotle needs is a drive-thru. After all, it wasn't meant to be a 5 star restaurant. So if they're going the route of fast food burritos, then they might as well add a drive-thru to alleviate some of the heavy traffic from inside. They could be like In n Out: another place that makes its food fresh, but serves it fast food style.]
