[115656524083240566464,100938464573651907239,I needed my battery/electrical looked at, due to two recent dead battery days. These guys were recommended by a small local shop in town that was too busy. When I arrived, they told me it would take them at least an hour to be able to tell him if the car had any problems. I didn't ask about rates, but fully expected to pay an inspection/diagnostic fee. After 15 minutes, they called me to say they'd squeezed it in; and everything was in working order. At my request, they also looked at my spark plugs after this. When I went to get the car back, they said "you're all set".... no charge, at all? I've never seen that happen before. Plus, their hourly rate is only $68. Maybe that's normal in this town? but it's 30-40% less than I'm used to paying.]
