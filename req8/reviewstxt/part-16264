[100619632013716158019,101034949821073536306,I went on a Friday and it was absolutely great! I think they tell you to avoid Mondays and Fridays so the place was practicly empty ha. The first lady was really short with me and gave me a hard time because I recently lost everything and couldn't exacly prove who I was, But the manager acually had a heart and helped me find out what I needed to do and was in and out in less than a half hour! great experince]
