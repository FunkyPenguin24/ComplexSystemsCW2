[103318297732807060216,100952975406549323723,I called Uncle Bob's to get pricing for a storage unit and spoke with Patricia. She was very abrupt and not very helpful. After 3 frustrating attempts at asking her a question and hearing her rude attitude, I ended the call. I will not be renting from them at this point. I should have read the other review here!!!]
