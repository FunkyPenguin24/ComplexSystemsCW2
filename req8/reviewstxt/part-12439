[101998993674062773934,100825334765798448747,I take my two boxers to Just Dogs on a regular basis. My dogs love it and the staff clearly pays close attention to the dogs. Yes, there is a restrictive interview process. That's part of the benefit, actually. They don't just leave them in a cage all day - the dogs actually play and interact with each other over the course of the day. That's why they have to check each dog out before allowing them to join. And, of course, there is a premium to pay for all of this. Is it more expensive than other boarding places? Yes. Is it harder to get in? Yes. Is it worth it? When I see how much my dogs enjoy it, absolutely.]
