[118259856479732766352,100452670295427992150,Great Hot dog and service! I would suggest the Rueben Dog it is out of this world good! The only dog I wasn't impressed with is the Bruschetta Dog, because the bruschetta is cold and it doesn't compliment the hot frank. Other than that you will not be disappointed.]
