[104578111798714051586,100823711080335668266,Cathy did a great job of putting me immediately at ease when I went to her for my first massage, I've gone to her for both general relaxation and for specific shoulder issues, and have come away refreshed, loose, and balanced each time. For several years now, I've made Cathy's massages a part of my regular regimen and general well-being. I highly recommend you do the same!]
