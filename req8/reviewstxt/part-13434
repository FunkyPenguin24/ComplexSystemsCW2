[103271921839938526135,100881147507960082578,Our experience with Bank Street Kia has been awesome. We purchased a 2013 Soul U2 on a Wednesday, signed the documents on the Thursday evening and picked up our vehicle the same night. Krystof and Frank were very thorough, accommodating and a pleasure to deal with. I also own a 2008 Kia Rio, which I purchased at Kia in Kanata, I wasn't pleased with the service so I switched the servicing of my vehicle to Kia Bank Street in 2009; the service has been excellent. Just one of the many reasons why we wanted to keep our business at Kia Bank Street. Krystof and Frank have continued to demonstrate what true service is all about. Thank you to everyone at Bank Street Kia. Debbie & Rob Erdos]
