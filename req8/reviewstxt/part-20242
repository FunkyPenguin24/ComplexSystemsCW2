[109866299020551336115,100072401839918841884,Delicious food! No wait at 6pm on a Friday was a plus. Just the right amount of breading on scallops, filling in crab cakes and batter on shrimp tempura. Left feeling full and my mouth is watering just thinking about the spicey tartar sauce! Service was good. Table could have been wiped cleaner before we were seated.]
