[113672738721132698408,100799454814558391776,My girlfriend and I went in in February and we wanted to get a simple infinity symbol on each of our left wrists. We were greeted by very friendly people and attended to in a very quick fashion. The shop was clean and inviting and Rick was more than polite! This was my very first tattoo and when we discussed the design of our tattoos he came up with very original ideas. He was a true professional, yet very friendly and accommodating. I felt very comfortable the entire time. The tattoo healed up super fast and I had no complications with it at all. It was overall a really nice experience. If you live in the Overland Park, Olathe area you should definitely go there.]
