[107550878198390536938,100199658101652049513,Don't do it, read the other reviews too, it's not just me. First, the agent sent a substitute and was late to show the house despite scheduling the appointment 4 business days in advance. Second, I scheduled a time with the agent to put in an application the night prior, as I arrived 5 minutes early, the agent was walking out the door. Third, they wanted a certified check for first month's rent at the time of application (no lease yet) and I wouldn't have occupied the place for another full month. This wouldn't have been a show stopper if they had bothered to mention this on any of the prior phone conversations or provided the application documents via email or considered a personal check (and I had a paystub demonstrating income over 7x the rent!). The final nail in the coffin was observing the interaction with other people in the office. One young kid (I say kid, he's 26) was dropping in to sign a lease, he had obviously applied earlier and provided the funds. It was supposed to have been left with the secretary by the agent who walked out the door, (remember her?) She had left and not informed anyone else in the office about this kid coming in nor left the lease at the desk as promised. At the same time, a different agent was arguing with some other tenants about how their house was habitable despite the water damage and most of the power being shut off because the cleanup company had ensured that they had a refrigerator and the heater on. Your mileage may vary but I will never rent from them nor shall they manage any property I may purchase in the future.]
