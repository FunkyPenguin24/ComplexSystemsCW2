[104509555249131480848,100711930687578768903,I have been stopping at this location for probably 5 or more years. I like the floor plan of this store as compared to others. I love the Latte's and the pick two. Tonight I had the Broccoli and cheese soup and the Sierra Turkey sandwich on the Asiago Cheese Focaccia. Yum!! My other favorite is the Fiji Apple Chicken Salad, always good. The food at Panera, regardless of location is always consistant.]
