[114616717216136489159,100379953499682666150,Just went through a terrible closing with Continental. They were unprofessional, inattentive and not at all detailed minded. During the closing they lost me points on the mortgage when the associate that was handling my loan went on an unannounced vacation without passing our loan to a fellow associate. The paperwork during closing took almost 4 hours to complete. The stack of paper was at least 4 inches tall and the duplication of effort was astounding. Now, two months later, they are threatening to pull our mortgage when they screwed up the paperwork and demanded that we now supply it. Ridiculous!]
