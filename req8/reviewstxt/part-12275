[103370605000757565602,100815877138285593476,Sadly, I will not be renewing my lease. Management is terrible. Bad communication between "corporate" and the main office has milked us out late fees we had no control of. Talking to other neighbors, we are not the only ones. If you like renting from people who run their apartments from some office in Texas and enjoy the outrageous fees/bad communication... this place is for you.]
