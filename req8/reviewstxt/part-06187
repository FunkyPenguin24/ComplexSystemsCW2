[114145833928660446637,100487013323709582897,I can only comment on experience - Had a bladder infection which would typically take 3-5 days on drugs to clear up. A family member called Marcos on my behalf and the next day I had no symptoms at all. I'm not saying it's a substitute for visiting a Dr. but it sure seemed to work for me.]
