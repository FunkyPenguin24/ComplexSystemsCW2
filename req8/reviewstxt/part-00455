Has a wonderful deck by the creek for meals, a smaller deck upstairs for relaxing, and a nice hottub (with privacy no less). The kitchen is well-appointed and the dining room table spacious. The twin beds bedroom downstairs perfect for little (or big!) children. The house is fun and attractive and not full of kitch! We would love to go back there. Carolyn Wallace]
