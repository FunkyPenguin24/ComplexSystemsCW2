[103173314942533701588,100712662447867123290,Jim has been cutting my hair for years. I started having him cut it at Lou's and followed him when he opened his own shop in Springfield. I was very happy when he opened a shop in Ozark. My son still sees Jim for a hair cut when he visits from Chicago. Great barbershop. Great conversation and Jim is great with kids, too.]
