[104712581348871380973,100167295846848872734,I have tried many things on this menu at this restaurant. Being a garlic lover to the max, I absolutely love everything. Joey's rule big-time!!! Christine is absolutely wonderful and so are the delivery people! I never have found anyone who does not listen and care about my order. ICO fries, ICO wings, Joey, Greek salad - all things I love - and they do them just the way I like. The sandwiches - especially on garlic bread - are wonderful. Go Enjoy! Yummmmmmm!]
