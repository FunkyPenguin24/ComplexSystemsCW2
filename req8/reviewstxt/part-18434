[109827477189436055551,101152642825663090013,We bought a short hair Hamster there to surprise our kids about a month ago and when we took it home he screeched and screamed which I have never heard before. A few weeks later he died and when we went to get a new one we were told that the short haired Hamsters have seemed like they have neurological issues, um why are you selling them then? So we got a long haired Hamster and literally a week to the day it died as well. That is the last time I step foot in that store.]
