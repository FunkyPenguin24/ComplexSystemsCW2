[101007408412890555628,100665196734905459213,BEWARE: They're more interested in getting your money than fixing the problem. I went to the Auto Diagnostic Center to FIX A GAS GUZZLING PROBLEM of getting only 11 miles/gallon when I should have been getting 20 miles/gallon. The diagnosis was that a full tune-up was needed: the tune-up was completed and I left with happy expectations. However, THE GAS GUZZLING PROBLEM WAS NOT FIXED. So I went to AutoZone for a free auto diagnosis of my car. The computer diagnosis indicated; 1. Fuel pressure or MAF (Mass Air Flow) sensor is defective 2.Oxygen sensor is defective 3. Ignition misfire 4. Fuel injector problem. Altho I paid over $340 for repair, the Auto Diagnogistic Center didn't perform a simple computer analysis to confirm the GAS GUZZLING PROBLEM had been fixed. For that reason they earned this Google commentary.]
