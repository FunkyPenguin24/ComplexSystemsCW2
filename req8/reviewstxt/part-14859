[117307244747532516503,100960081700055187788,I was referred to Revolution Chiropractic by my parents. They have been going there since it has opened and they have seen huge improvements. My mother had been suffering from severe osteoporosis, and chronic back pain for years, and the adjustments allowed my mother to partake in activities such as bowling that she wasn't able to do before without throwing out her back. Her bone density is back to normal, and she hasn't thrown out her back in 2 years. I have been in Marching Band for the past 8 years, and since going to the chiropractors office I have more mobility in my lower back, and I can sleep easily without it becoming sore. I have also suffered from knee problems since middle school and was told that I would have to get surgery on my knee if they didn't see improvements. The chiropractors office indicated that my pelvis was rotated and after about a year of adjustments, the doctor told me that the cartilage around my joints looked better and I can now run without my knee brace. I also no longer suffer from multiple headaches a day. The staff at the office is wonderful! They know everyone by name and you are always welcomed with a smile. They make you feel right at home, and the best part is that the adjustments don't even take that long. You are in and out of the office in 15mins. I would highly recommend this office to anyone. Thank you for all you do Dr. Baron and Dr. Miceli (:]
