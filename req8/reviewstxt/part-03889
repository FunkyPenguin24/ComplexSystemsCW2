[115790442718544984801,100363004304162207264,I ordered from this warehouse and 2 weeks later heard nothing. I emailed asking if something was back-ordered and they were waiting on it. They assured me they were just busy. Two weeks after that I get an email saying they don't have some things in stock and that they will be shipping what they have to me. So that was very frustrating. I received part of my order and expected the rest to be sent shortly. Two weeks later the rest of the order shipped. I got no acknowledgement of poor service or apology. Maybe its not warranted but it definitely was not the what I expected. I will be purchasing my next order from Northern Brewing.]
