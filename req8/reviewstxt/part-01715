[103945920722564443234,100248177148469248151,For take-out, especially sushi, this is one of the better places around. The quality is very good for the price - be sure to order similarly priced rolls if you want the best 2-for-1 deal. Eating in at the restaurant isn't quite as appealing to me, as others have mentioned the service isn't very friendly. However I will say that the service is prompt and competent.]
