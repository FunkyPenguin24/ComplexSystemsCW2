[101053643676155938539,100377969637832712345,I bought a car via email from John Scott. Not having met me nor knowing for sure whether I was a legit buyer or not he treated me as if I was sitting in front of him and was his only customer. He was very responsive, too the point and never pushy. After the deal was done I showed up to get the car, signed a few documents and was out of there in less than 10 minutes. Best car buying experience ever and highly recommend John.]
