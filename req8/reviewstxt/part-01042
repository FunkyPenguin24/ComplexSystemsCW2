[102582465954869436884,100213043184741380365,I went threw Adecco to be a Operations Technician Assistant on site at Google in the Dalles and all I can say is that it was a waste of time. I enjoyed my work and did well or so I was told. However out of the blue Adecco Called me up at 10:30pm at night and told me my position was over and that I should not report to work tomorrow. They said that I did good work and it wasn't performance related. I just wasn't needed any longer. Guess I should have known temp work wouldn't turn into full time work. In my honest opinion DO NOT WORK FOR ADECCO NO MATTER WHAT!]
