[110364854476076088880,101022311868872904847,It is with great pleasure that I recommend McLoughlin Plumbing & Heating Co. to anyone who has to replace their heating/air conditioning system! When we realized our old system was having problems, we called several companies for estimates. McLoughlin's "Chris" was knowledgeable and patient answering any and all questions that we had. The installation team was prompt, professional, and took the extra care necessary to ensure that they were neat/careful throughout the entire process. We are very happy with our choice to use McLoughlin Plumbing & Heating Co. I know we can count on their service for years to come!!!]
