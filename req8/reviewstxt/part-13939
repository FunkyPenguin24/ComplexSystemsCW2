[100142619175519789260,100907695729742221528,I had appointment at this store, went in describe the problem to the genius agent. I had a bad battery where usage and stand by time was same. The diagnostics said battery was good so I asked why I was having this problem then? He agreed to to change battery for FREE. He comes back after 15 minutes with sad news that they cant change it because there is liquid damage. WHAT? I told him I am the only owner of this phone and there has been no water damage to the phone. He acted like I was lying and I was crappy college student. I told him so many times there cant be damage because I am VERY CAREFUL about my gadgets he said his same thing that they cant service it because he found LIQUID damage inside which was STICKY. I went outside and called APPLE toll free they told me to talk to store manager who was JAMES and he explained the same thing and wanted me to buy new phone for 199$ I walked out pissed. Couple days later I went to Apple store in Kansas city, MO (Country Club Plaza) I told them what happend at Leawood store they checked the phone and IT WAS LEAK FROM BATTERY WHICH WAS STICKY!! The country club plaza store replaced the whole phone and gave me new one. The LEAWOOD store failed to identify problem and did not treat me like a customer because the cloths i was wearing and the way i went into store.]
