[111182067989113821185,101157629519900188333,My fiance and I are in the process of buying our first home. After finding the perfect home, our realtor recommended this company for the inspection. Doug Wehr was our inspector and he was absolutely fantastic. He was incredibly thorough and made sure to explain every step of the process and every detail regarding any serious or potential issue in the home. We are so appreciative of his time and expertise during our first inspection experience. I would highly recommend Doug to any of my family and friends.]
