[106575766809804184567,100677945110887707541,If going to trade in clothes, be warned: they will offer you SIGNIFICANTLY LESS than you could ever imagine! It really is shameful. I had empathy for the employees yesterday when they offered me 3.50 per Halloween outfit (WITH accessories) that I had worn ONCE! (mind you: I paid more for all of the accessories COMBINED than they offered me in TOTAL for ALL of the outfits which I paid around $50 for.) I was prepared to accept at LEAST $5 per outfit, but was genuinely offended when I heard 3.50! Claimed that they would sell the outfits for $10 each, $12 with accessories. I would love to go back today and see what they're currently marked on the shelf for...you would probably be better off using Ebay, donating, or recycling your outfits.]
