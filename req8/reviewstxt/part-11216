[107048756441999659106,100759192150418692082,I usually take my vehicles to the dealer, but have had bad service/luck with that lately. Continental has the most welcoming staff of the dozens of shops I've visited. From now on, if they fix it, and its broke, I will be taking my vehicle to them. Very Friendly! Legendary service and workmanship.]
