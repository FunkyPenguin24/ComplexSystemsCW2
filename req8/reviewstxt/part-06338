[101123477311922940283,100494656816622643983,James, the manager, is awesome! He is very friendly, but professional. I just secured three storage units today after having them on hold for a few days. James emailed me a reminder and also gave me a call as a reminder as well. He wasn't pushy, but just plain helpful. When we walked in today he couldn't have been nicer. He knew who we were and helped us right away. I couldn't be happier and am really happy with our transaction with James. Two big thumbs up!]
