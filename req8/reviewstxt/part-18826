[102254954432055660536,101173781695172742183,My experience began with an online inquiry, submitted at 9:30 pm, looking for a particular model/color combination. I received a call within 5 minutes. I was floored not expecting a response until the next day. Steve Bogar and I exchanged a few calls about colors & options that were important to us. He assured us they had the best inventory to look at. However it was 45 minutes away, so we opted to go to the Braman dealership, 5 minutes from home. That experience was poor, we quickly left and drove to Coral Springs. Steve greeted us, patiently showed us the vehicles in stock and about 3 hours later we drove home in our new Q5! All of the 'crap' that dealerships put you through to get you to commit were alleviated with their sales process. From determining a fair value for your trade-in, to the "I gotta talk to the boss" routine, it was pleasant. I would definitely recommended this dealership & Steve Bogar!]
