[106494873816968547288,100890323047001416796,I tend to be quite anxious about going under anesthesia, and I had put off having my wisdom tooth removed for a long time. When my dentist told me it had to be removed or would damage my other back teeth, I went to see Dr. Grellner. He and his staff definitely put me at ease during the consultation. I had general anesthesia for the surgery, and it went very smoothly. Dr. Grellner and his staff are kind, knowledgeable, and professional, and the office is beautiful. Although my tooth was difficult to extract, I had minimal swelling and an easy recovery. When I did have a question after hours, I received a return call quickly. I would highly recommend Dr. Grellner to anyone who needs wisdom teeth removed.]
