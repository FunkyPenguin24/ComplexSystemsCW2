[100254219887109012864,100585857586630949685,We really enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance of the place despite the fact that it was quite noisy. We did not care for the seating-it's very tight and we were seated at a long table with several other people. But we enjoyed our food nonetheless: very tasty burger (we tried the #4 with green chili and fried egg), and delicious mac & chz with a nice cheddar bite. The fries shoulda-woulda been good, but they were too salty. Fun little place in a fun neighborhood.]
