[102819021932526900955,101080460020217799593,We started off great with both Larry Jr. and Sr. They said all the right things and made every effort to assist us. Over time, they continually broke promises and caused problems. We purchased a very expensive oven that they severely damaged during delivery (not to mention the damage they did to our place), offering no assistance in fixing it. Despite the oven being purchased by us in "good working condition" they did not deliver us the screw set required to assemble the oven (as promised) and further, did not deliver a $3,000 part required to make the oven operational. All in all this was supposed to be purchasing an oven, assembling it, and turning it on. It ended up being an oven that required us to fabricate multiple parts that they damaged during delivery, fabricate a $3,000 part they simply lost or never had, and 3 weeks waiting for a screw set from the manufacturer. In contacting them to help rectify these problems, they dodged our calls, promised calls back with information and never followed up, etc but never made good on anything. Dealing with Larry's Equipment has single handedly delayed us more than 3 weeks in opening our business. They sold us on being a family business that's been doing this for years, but at the first sign of problems left us hanging. They also attempted to change the price terms of our contract on the scheduled date of delivery and attempted to withhold delivery in an effort to procure more money from us. After several heated exchanges, those issues were settled, but in hindsight I would've gladly paid double to work with a more professional company that made good on promises and didn't outright break the equipment during delivery. I'm not recommending anyone else, I just would personally never purchase equipment from Larry's Equipment again. Again, this is just my opinion based on my own personal experience.]
