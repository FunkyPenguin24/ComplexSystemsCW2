[103841141703180047440,100568957030434595747,This gun shop is a great addition to what is otherwise a relatively small town in a fairly rural area. They have reasonable prices on firearms, reasonable ammunition prices (given the context of being this far from Kansas City) and a solid gunsmith who delivers when promised and usually at a better value than expected. Not sure what the other reviewer was referencing, but I am a regular customer, have bought a gun here and had a lot of gunsmith work done here. In my experience, this is not a cliquish place. Sometimes when you walk in the door, there are groups of guys shooting the breeze when the shop is empty, but that is just the kind of small-town service environment you can expect here.]
