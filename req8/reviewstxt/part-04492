[104112690740144232468,100397564991216407497,I stayed here a month after returning from a deployment while integrating with work and finding a apartment. The staff was excellent with a good clean crew once a week. The building and facilities are older and there were a few minor issues like the toilet getting clogged (a quick hit with the plunger and it worked great the rest of my stay). The exercise room was a bit lacking (only cardio stuff) but everything worked. You can somewhat hear the other tenants especially if they are being loud. No bugs anywhere which hasn't been the case with all extended stay places I've been to. The price was amazing $47.99 a night which is hard to beat for the area especially at the last minute. The place was very safe. I totally recommend this place if you need a place to live out of temporarily while looking for something more permanent or for buisness travelers on a week or longer short term job.]
