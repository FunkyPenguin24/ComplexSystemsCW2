[102344352210346220377,100921969600379462608,It's a buffet with all that comes with being a buffet: huge selection, questionable sharing of communal dishes with strangers and children. Some parents don't teach their kids not to lick the serving spoons at buffets or stick their hands in. Some dishes are fresh and good, others have spent a little too much time sitting untouched. Always crowded though and the food isn't good enough to explain it for me.]
