[113625372362760576192,100323879649504735681,As a former college athlete turned weekend warrior, I get banged up from time to time. When the "wait and see method" doesn't work, I call Dr. Alex. He has treated my knee and shoulder so far, with great success. His treatment approach is thorough and comprehensive. He took the time to explain my injuries, answer all of my questions, and he makes workout/training modifications to help me stay active. I have referred my friends and family and I highly recommend Dr. Alex]
