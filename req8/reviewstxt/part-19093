At The Granite Guy showroom, you can select your granite slab. That is right, you are not looking at a 12" by 12" sample, but the entire slab. The price includes everything, including the kitchen sink and removal of your old counter top. You can upgrade the sink and pay for them to connect the plumbing, but that is it. The Granite Guy makes buying so easy. The installers are craftsmen, who really care about their work. They proudly told me they have the best seams in the business. And I believe them. The guy, who installed our tile backsplash (from another company) and who installs a lot of tile in kitchens with new granite counter tops, had trouble finding the seam. So did two friends who came to see our new kitchen. If you do not know where to look, our counter top is seamless.]
