[107466906406123732401,100005951628807069925,They did a terrible job on my french shellac. They promised a 14 day guarantee. After 5 days my nails were chipping. I called to make an appt to have them redone. Because of my schedule and their location I am not able to get there until the weekend, however Saturday is day 12 and apparently that falls outside their 14 day guarantee and they won't fix them for free. Not a place I want to do business with.]
