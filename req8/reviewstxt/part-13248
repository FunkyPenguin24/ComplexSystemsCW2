[101414736284012239047,100871307474452841694,We have a love story with Coach House. My husband used to live in the pink building right acroos the street. This was more than 20 years ago, and he went everyday to Couch House to have a cup of cofee. It was the place where, 12 years ago, my fiancee, proposed to me. It was the very first place, 9 years ago, where we went after our baby girl was born. It is the place where we celebrate our birthdays, anniversaries, graduations and even when our family comes from overseas. It is the place we still go with our friends to get together and talk about our lives. It is the the best place in the area. We love the food, the decoration and the service. Everything is beautiful!!!]
