[102618327223281258906,100961646685362709095,If you like stale, precooked cakes delivered slowly by surly staff, by all means, this is your place.We ordered a birthday cake ten days in advance. It was NOT ready when we went to pick it up, so we got to watch them prepare it ... pre-made cake, canned frosting and amateurish assembly .. truly a triple threat for a bakery.They assured us it was, despite all appearances, fresh. It was not. It was dry, mealy and almost inedible. It was an embarassment to serve to my son.If there were a rating below "poor", I would choose it.]
