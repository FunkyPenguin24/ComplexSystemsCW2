[100999734352059028733,100950795696292843577,My wife and I have been all of Los Angeles shopping for carpets, and Pashgian owner David Mehraban is simply the best. He quickly zeroed in on what we liked and proceeded to dig out and display one great piece after the next. We are extremely picky and were surprised to find 4 pieces that we actually wanted to see in our home in La Canada. As it turned out, one of the pieces that David identified that we weren't sure about in his store ended up being the best! He is knowledgeable without being pushy, has great taste, and is easy to do business with. Highly recommended.]
