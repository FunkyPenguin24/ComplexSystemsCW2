[111409548089841999057,100348778069190650438,I went in to look for something sweet to go along with my black coffee, and lo and behold, I found the perfect spot. The bakery had blueberry lemon cupcakes on sale, so I took the last of the batch. They were wonderful. Before we left Arizona, we took pumpkin cheesecake and lemon cupcakes to our family in Glendale, along with gluten free lunches for my nieces and nephews (one of my nieces has a gluten allergy). Salads and hamburgers were perfect, cheesecake was awesome, and the lemon cupcakes had the perfect amount of lemon flavor.]
