[101230940196166785080,100279765736285013517,The best car buying experience one could have. Completely hassle free. I called up Aaron, said "Hey, my car's dead and I need a new one." We spent about a week discussing possibilities and how his process works and I ended up getting a ridiculous deal on a 2006 BMW 325i almost-fully loaded. I honestly thought I had 10 years before I was in BMW ownership territory but Aaron made me look like a fool for thinking that. I have recommended him to my friends (one of those recommendations not only bought a car but started working for him!) and next car I buy will definition go through him first.]
