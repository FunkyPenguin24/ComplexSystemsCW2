[107283015509135749991,100365951630586777004,It's the second or third time I've used this service and it is absolutely top notch! I'm always rushing to get it through with a incredible speed and each time I've been impressed with the capable staff they have. Props to Michael who worked with me this time and got it to me 6 hours before my scheduled flight. Despite me sending him the wrong documents twice! I can't speak for the non premium service but I'm a very satisfied customer and 100% sure that my application would have been denied without their help. Thank you, Trevor Driscoll P.S. I feel like I have to mention that it is indeed exorbitantly expensive but it's also well worth it if you are on a tight deadline and have a complicated visa like my India employment visa.]
