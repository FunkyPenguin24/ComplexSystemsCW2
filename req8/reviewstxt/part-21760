[116698578031718845929,100154035277841910766,I have gone to Dr. Hernandez for over 25 years. Even though I have relocated further away from his practice out to the Rowlett area, I continue to go the distance to see him because he has taken wonderful care of my cats and dogs through the years. My daughter even travelled from Fort Worth to have her two kittens declawed there because he had the most reasonable prices in the metroplex. He will always take the time to explain treatment options and always is very kind and thoughtful and has a great sense of humor. I always walked out of his office feeling better than when I walked in.]
