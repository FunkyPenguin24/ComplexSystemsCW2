[100921727599213275269,100926394102618779996,This place has some nice steaks and other meat entrees; but the service was only so so definitely not what one would expect from a place that is so expensive. I guess it is normal as it's location is on Lincoln but still I was expecting a bit more, the drinks took forever to come out and the server was not very attentive. The only thing that made up for it was that the steak was good.]
