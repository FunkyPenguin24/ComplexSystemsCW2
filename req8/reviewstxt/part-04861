On my own I had reached a dead end with my book, "The Other Side of The Ice". I found Smith and from the moment I got in touch with them I felt the aspect of "family". I have to admit, due to my previous experiences, I was a bit cautious, but after meeting Dina and Sophia face-to-fcae I was greatly relived to see that my feelings were completely justified. Sophia immediately set up a plan by which she would start approaching all angles of the media and start pitching the book. Almost immediately requests for interviews started coming in, I could see that my books sale were improving. I can’t say enough good about Smith; they are indeed family, are open to all of my suggestions and give you that wonderful feeling that you are their only client! I won’t hesitate to use them again for my upcoming projects."]
