[104988076079041708561,100031360773967665616,Very happy. Stopped in thinking I needed a brake job on the front brakes. I informed Jeff, the person that I talked to, that I had read the unfavorable reviews online and was skeptical. He assured me they wouldn't do any work unnecessarily and without my permission. After inspecting my brakes, he informed me that I did not need brakes at all. The front brakes were at 50% and the back at 85%. If they were truly dishonest, they would have just charged me for the brake job and did them anyway. I think it's great that they were honest and I'll be going back in 20k miles to have them check again.]
