[116676037672301033125,100342977615392450977,My experience at Sheridan Ford was unlike any Ford Dealer experience I have ever had. On Tuesday, February 25th at 8:30pm, my 2010 Ford Fusion suddenly stalled out on Kirkwood Highway. Panic stricken, I called AAA and had them bring it to Sheridan Ford. At 7:34am the next day, Chuck called me to determine what had happened to my vehicle. Sensing that I was still upset, Chuck reassured me that he would take care of my car and find out what caused this to happen. When I arrived at 8:30am, Tara and Chuck were at the desk and greeted me with a welcoming hello. They took me back to the lounge area and told me that as soon as they knew anything that they'd let me know. About 30 minutes later, Chuck came back and explained to me about the nation-wide recall on the throttle body that affected the Fusions, which was the root of my vehicle's issue. He also explained that my battery and mass air sensor needed to be looked at, which was a HUGE blessing. Once the vehicle was finished, Chuck and Tara told me that if I had any questions or concerns, that they're just a phone call away. They treated me like I was part of their family...how thoughtful was that!? On Thursday, Chuck gave me a follow up call, just to make sure I was okay, as well as the vehicle. The fact that he went the extra mile to make sure that *I* was okay, speaks volumes. Thank you so much for going above and beyond to make my day that much brighter, and to Tara and Chuck for making this process a little less scary.]
