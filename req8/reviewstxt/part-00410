The day I went (a beautifully sunny June day) we were the only people there. I feel like with how short the ride is, maybe $20 for 3 rides down the hill would be reasonable. That's still on the pricey side, but I would probably pay it. $50 should give you unlimited rides all day, not a single minute long ride. It's like paying for a day pass at Dollywood but only getting to ride one ride. Does that make sense? I feel like it doesn't make sense economically, there's so much opportunity to make more money.]
