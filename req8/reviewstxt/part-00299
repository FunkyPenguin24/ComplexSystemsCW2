[103593519344479672986,100175076921454128276,Music Source did a fabulous job at our August 24th, 2013, wedding at the Oakley Lindsay Center in Quincy, IL! Jon Roth was great to work with throughout the whole planning process and really paid attention to each little detail, making my job as the bride much easier. Jon met with us several times before the big day to go through details and made sure everything was just how we wanted it to be. He is very prompt with emails and all communication and always responds right away. His high level of professionalism and commitment to providing the best DJ service in the area is one of the many reasons we are glad we chose him to be our DJ, and we are so happy he was willing to travel all the way to Quincy from Springfield. And he not only acts as a DJ, but also as Master of Ceremonies (MC) to ensure everything runs smoothly. The music sounded great, we had fabulous looking uplights around the room in our light pink wedding color, and Jon made sure to keep everyone having fun all night. We also rented the bubble machine, which was a huge hit, especially with the youngsters. For our father/daughter dance he spent along time putting a 6 song mix together that had everyone raving all night. I would highly recommend Music Source DJ services! - Graceann and Andrew DeVlieger]
