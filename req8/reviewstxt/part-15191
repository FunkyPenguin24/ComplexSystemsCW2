The place was clean, the floors were spotless, during a fairly busy day. The tables had room between them rather than being pressed together to maximize occupancy. Our server was attentive and pleasant. The appetizer was brought out by a different employee, who was equally attentive and friendly, rather than dropping the food off and scampering off. The drink was brought out by a third employee, who also was attentive, ensuring we had everything we needed. It gave me the sense that everyone was working together like a well-oiled machine. The food was correctly cooked to order and flavorful. This is the only place I feel like I can actually get a medium rare steak and have it not overcooked. The margarita was the best I'd had in a long time. Overall it was a perfect experience. Maybe I got lucky, but I will definitely be going back.]
