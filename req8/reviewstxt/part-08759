[105515562274186404492,100626176452814410846,We were told there would be a 30 min. wait and we sat outside in the wind for an hour. When we were finally seated we received drinks but they didn't take our order for another 25 minutes. The salad plates were hot...yuck. The salad plates were not cleared and when the food finally came it was less than satisfactory, the steak was burned, pasta had half & half for sauce, fish really small, thin and tasted like it was warmed in the microwave. All of the food was lukewarm, not hot and another server was kind enough to bring us our food because our waiter was missing....again. The server never filled our water, brought missing silverware, asked how the food was, brought additional drinks or offered any bread. When we share the poor dining experience with manager she shrugged her shoulders, made excuses and I am sure that the poor service, food quality and food quantity will continue. After a 3 hour dining experience we drove directly to Culver's for dessert because we didn't another 3 hour to wait.]
