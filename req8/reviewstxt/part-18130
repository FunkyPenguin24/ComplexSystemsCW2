[105060356074190344044,101137566964494495282,I very much enjoyed my experience. Staff was friendly and helped me pick out the perfect flavor for me after going through too many that I thought I would like. I would come here again. There are a few things I would recommend to make it better. Its called vape escape, so make if feel like people are getting away and have a relaxed place to go. Nothing fancy, maybe a couch and a TV in the overly accomodating floorset you have where vapers can buy there favorite flavor, kick back and relax. Again, other than way too much space that way too little was done with, I had an excellent experience. I liked it a lot. I would have loved it if there was more to it.]
