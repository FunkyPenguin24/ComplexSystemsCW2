[109626937091532541496,100071708638299844959,I have first hand seen the decline of this property. It was pretty nice in 2009 during our first year so we decided to return in Jan 2013. The tenants have become younger and very disrespectful. The common areas of the property have been damaged and left unfixed. But the worst part are the staff. They will lie and use every and any opportunity and excuse to take your money with fines during move out. This is a clear desperation because their property is falling apart and they're trying to stay afloat. I could go on in detail but there is no need. My advice is do not go here. The apartments are NOT nice enough for the price.]
