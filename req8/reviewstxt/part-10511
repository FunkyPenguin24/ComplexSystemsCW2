[100078774789189156081,100721004961153571487,I crave a lot of their chocolate covered items here. They're all huge, and loaded with lots of chocolate, like the chocolate covered granola, chocolate covered cayenne and lavendar, chocolate covered coconut cookie, and a whole bunch of chocolate covered dried fruits. AHHH. It's perfect for my that time of the month, when I feel like the world hates me, my life sucks, and I feel the need to really evaluate my self. and blah blah blah. You know womanly troubles. It's not a dessert place, it's more of a healthy lunch spot. They have really skinny sandwiches, that seem small and expensive, but most of the time they're really tasty. There are also soups, salads, and other things, that I don't usually try. I just get the desserts and the sandwiches. I really enjoy them. I also was able to pick up a few dessert items here for my old boss, who had gluten, dairy, and animal product allergies. Also please note that it's good to know what you want to order very quickly. This place can fill up fast during the lunch hour, and other people can sometimes end up ordering before you, and even though you were in the front of the line, everybody else can get their order before you, because they already knew what to order. If that doesn't bother you, then you really don't have to worry about it.]
