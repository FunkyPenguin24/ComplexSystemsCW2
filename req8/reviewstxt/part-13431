[102949343925779472902,100881014123041167905,It was packed and the doorman said comon in, pleanty of space. There were no open table and no space by the bar. I waited by the restroom and waited for someone to leave. I got a seat at the bar and the barteneder pressured me into getting some weird south jmaican beer which tasted like crap and i didnt finish it. He was so exstatic that i try this nerw beer , it felt like he was going to die if i didnt like it. So i said it was good. IT WAS NOT. I ordered a burger and fries, the food was ok, I waited 40 minutes for it, but its busy so its ok. anyways Im not comin back, unless i have a reservation.]
