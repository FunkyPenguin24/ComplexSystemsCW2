[106830548295397267806,100236635740418124185,The doctor's were on the verge of surgically gluing my lung to my side because they could not find an answer to why my lung kept painfully and spontaneously collapsing. Thank goodness for Brantley! His vast knowledge of the human body and his skill as a massage therapist honed in on my muscular trigger point, and in one fell swoop, stopped my recurring issue. Truly amazing! I know it sounds crazy, but it just proves how there can be such a simple solution if we just engage someone who knows how to listen to our bodies. It has been years and no repeat occurrence and I am so grateful. I have also had just good ol' massages from him and appreciate his professionalism and personal attention to making me feel 100% awesome in my skin. No matter what your need, he can tailor the perfect session for you.]
