[106032004205101080166,100569896508577982592,The problem with my 2001 Toyota Tacoma was found and repaired as requested. The only problem I have is nobody called me to say my car was done. I also asked for a after market estimate for some exhaust system replacement because the Toyota parts price was way too expensive. I never got a phone call or an estimate on paper for the after market estimate.]
