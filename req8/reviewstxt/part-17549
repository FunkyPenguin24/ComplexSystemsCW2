[100507632639815614039,101105919110456930560,If you rent a place that these guys manage, expect to NOT get your full deposit back no matter what. The place I rented had things wrong with it all over (really bad stained rugs, cracked tile, etc) Before my lease was up I painted, had the rugs professionally cleaned, and I spent 6 hours cleaning to make the place spotless after I got all my things out. They kept half of my deposit to PAINT and get the RUGS CLEANED!!!! I have never ONCE in my life lost any portion of any deposit I have ever left on a place. They wouldn't even do a final walk through with me there and go over the checklist we made when I moved in. If they had, I could of pointed out all the repairs I made with my OWN money. Gee, I wonder why? Fair warning on these guys, they are not honest.]
