[104505299213528701921,101150932586058755071,This office is great and I recommend it to anyone needing physical medicine. After experiencing lower back pains for several years I contacted Dr. McLelland's office to have a consult. He was able to get me into his office quick and began working on the healing process. Not only did he help alleviate my pain, but he also did a great job at explaining how I came to experience the pain. Dr. McLelland and his staff are very professional, respectful, and friendly. For anyone looking for physical medicine look no further than ChiroworksVA.]
