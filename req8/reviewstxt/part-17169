Janice is awesome, and everyone of the staff members are fantastic and professional. I have nothing bad to say about this practice. I only wish they accepted my insurance and I didn't have to pay out of pocket up front. I understand the reason they do it the way they do, but it can be difficult to pay out that money all at once.]
