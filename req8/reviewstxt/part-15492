[113909015464169975904,100992992998953386557,Dr. Anne Lundquist is an extremely gifted Chiropractor. I'm a Chiropractor and I usually treat my own wife but when my wife was pregnant......I referred my own wife (without hesitation) to see Dr. Anne because I know she is one of the best in Prenatal Chiropractic Care. My wife delivered a few weeks ago and it only took 30 mins of active "pushing" and just like that....our baby girl "popped" out. I am positive that Dr. Anne's treatments helped big time. And we're bringing our new baby girl to see Dr. Anne for a check up to make sure her nervous system is working 100%. Thanks Dr. Anne!]
