[109835859912763234317,100094257185064260313,I have trained at a variety of Brazilian jiu-jitsu academies over the last twelve years, and Gracie Barra Springfield compares favorably to them all. The head instructor, Marcos, is not only a great teacher, but is also kind, generous, and passionate about what he does. This school is as well-suited to the serious practitioner who wants to train, hard, every day as it is to the hobbyist who is just looking to keep fit in a fun, friendly environment.]
