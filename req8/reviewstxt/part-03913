[117273411150626805708,100364202479161242744,Over priced drinks ($11 - $12 for your basic mixed drinks and $6 for a domestic beer). The service was decent. The food was decent, nothing special. Music pretty good. The overall atmosphere was pleasant. What sucked is that they stopped serving drinks and food at about 1:15am, turned off the music and turned up the lights. They then began to rudely tell people to leave even though the bar closes at 2:00am. Not the kind of place you want to go to on a regular basis. This was my third time there and this is typical of each of my experiences.]
