[100226905051450899896,100256590301266130722,Place with real promise, but only offers louts and noise before a Swindon match (louts not necessarily the Swindon fans). Decent layout, reasonable prices and a pool table. The place is much better on a weekday than at a weekend. Serves as a good warm-up for a night on the town]
