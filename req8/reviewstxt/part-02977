[107616333204908332373,100313011740922154288,The Buddha is an icon in Fort Myers. It's still the ONLY true rock club in the area. It's not a restuarant, it's not a sports bar, it's not a cowboy club, and it doesn't have a buffet-line. They've got the area's best sound system and book top bands. Come to The Buddha if you want a great drink, poured by the area's top bartenders while you rock out. The Buddha is where locals go for great music, great service, and great drinks. You know what they say...go where the locals go! Drink, Dance, Rock Out... what else do you need?]
