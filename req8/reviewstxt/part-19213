[103746895574192130802,100017064310780062087,DO NOT store your stuff here! Several reasons: 1. The gate stays open for what seems like about 5 minutes after entering or exiting, letting anyone come through. 2. The ONLY security camera is at the front gate. Anyone that gets on the lot can do anything they want to your vehicle stored there or any of the units and there is NO security. This means your loss. The back lot where vehicles contains all kinds of vehicles that have been trashed - looks like a junk yard. 3. I had a vehicle stored here that got broken into and on another date had about $35 in gas syphoned out of the tank. What did they say up front? "Oh, sorry, but there's nothing we can do." 4. The late fees are assessed on the 7th and for the space I rent, the late fee is more than the month's rent. 5. Plus, they have the signs all over for the $1 for the first month's rent special, BUT that is 'subject to availability' - which means that it's a crap shoot on whether or not you get the deal or pay full price. Overall, this place is the WORST in my opinion and I am getting my stuff out before this month ends.]
