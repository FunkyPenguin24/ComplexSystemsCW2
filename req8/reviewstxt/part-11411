[100175959629262781844,100769634763583567343,We just return from rishikesh last month and this hotel is such on a good location the view from room is like we are floating in holy river ganga, hotel is situated right next to ganga. Open air restaurant is just made for us, food was great , service was excellent and hotel staff was really helpful they made our one day tour with rafting. Such a pleasant stay that was totally unforgettable, Highly Recommend]
