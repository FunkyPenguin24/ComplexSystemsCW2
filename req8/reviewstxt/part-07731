[100350442190732154677,100573248509461891540,Spectacular! Loved the audio tour and even tried the guided. Both were great! The history is superb. The tour is well marked and you can go at your own pace. The restorations as well as the percentage of original structure is great. Absolutely no complaints. On a side note the city of Edinburgh is equally as sensational. You have to visit it and take it all in.]
