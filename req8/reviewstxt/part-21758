[108806365904508175877,100153964818508764536,One of my family's favourite places in Mississauga. We love the fountain where kids and kids-at-heart can run through the water and play. It has provided several hours of free entertainment for my daughter this weekend. During one of the free concerts they had, my husband and I were dancing in the water. I'm really looking forward to the free public skating this winter, now that my daughter is old enough to try. But there is more too! Free yoga, free movies on the big screen, and a great place to go watch the soccer game!]
