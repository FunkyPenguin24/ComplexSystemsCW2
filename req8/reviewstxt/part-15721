[110903911374073289700,101006217266184295805,Bert's has been my local go-to beer shop for the last year or so. I can't find anywhere else in this area that compares to the great selection of brews (not to mention the friendliness, knowledge and passion for great beer the staff have). I would recommend Bert's to anyone looking for a large variety as well as the charming personality of a smaller business. Support your local brew shop!]
