[118072707008611469559,100742842403629683880,I took my 4 year old son to this office for advice on a skin issue he was having. After SEVERAL treatments that caused him to have giant welts on his skin we started to question whether or not these doctors know what they are doing. Come to find out after consulting with several specialists and pediatricians, his condition would have gone away on it's own and what they did is NEVER done, especially to children. It is an outdated method that was completely unnecessary. I was disgusted and outraged! To put a little kid through something like this because of money or lack of education is despicable. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND NOT SEEING THIS OFFICE!]
