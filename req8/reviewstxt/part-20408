[100229352036802973852,100081430442681762026,Mr. Damon Shorterage and the Germain Mazda staff were kind, intelligent, and honest with their approach. They provided me information to help me make my decision and they did not "over sell" the sale. I felt I was provided an excellent car at a great price and I am very happy with the decision I made. The Germain Mazda staff assured me that I would be taken care of, in a very fair way, should anything happen within the realm of the warranty and explained what those situations might look like. They answered my questions honestly and thoroughly. I highly recommend the Germain dealerships and particularly recommend Germain Mazda. I look forward to our continued relationship and am now a proud driver of a Mazda6 from Germain Mazda in Columbus, OH.]
