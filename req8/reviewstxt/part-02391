[108408306739951430391,100281936016931027682,I've been having every vehicle that I've owned serviced at this place for the past 5 years. The owner Muhammad and his guys are absolutely amazing. I have a hard time trusting automotive shops but these guys can be trusted 100%. Besides the excellent and diligent work, the customer service is excellent as well. They will never leave you in the dark and the pricing is great too. I would, just as I have in times past, recommend BAAM Automotive to everyone.]
