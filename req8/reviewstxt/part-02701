[105819083837734872221,100297903286031838441,This place has the worst service. I dropped my boat off for a tune up and fix a water leak. They had it for 4 weeks to do this charged me 300 dollars. I got home and leak isn't fixed. Took it back and owner said she would make it right by not charging me any labor to fix it right and said it would take 2 weeks so I agreed. 7 weeks later after numerous calls decided to go get it. They did nothing, didnt even order gaskets they needed. There customer service is horrible. Never take anything here that needs work]
