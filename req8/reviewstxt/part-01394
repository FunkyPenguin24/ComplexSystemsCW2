[115285603409768547174,100230725620904513412,I had surgery, and many tests last year. I When I checked in, I provided my full name, current address and phone number. I also provided a copy of my drivers license (at their request) that had my current address. I also completed an on-line profile with all current information. I was never billed for the serivice because they used an old address that was on file from 13 years ago. I also never received calls for follow up. However, then my bill was sent to several collection agencies and now on my credit report. When I called Patient Accounts they told me they the address they billed to and the phone number they called. I told them I hadnt live at that address for 13+ years or had that phone number. They did say they had the correct address and don't know why they billed the wrong address. They apologized but it doesn't help that this was sent to a collection agency and I'm now having trouble getting a loan.]
