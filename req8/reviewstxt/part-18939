[101430354363898386911,100002677759899282462,This Super 8 looks nice on the outside but run down on the inside, The place needs updating. In the room I checked into the bathroom smelled of urine, the faucet in the tub was leaking, the toilet lid was broken and actually came off as I opened the lid, you can hear all the cars, semis, & motorcycles from the interstate, tight small parking spaces. You better not stop here with a truck and trailer! I would not recommend this Super 8]
