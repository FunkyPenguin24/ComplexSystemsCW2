[106523930694378655973,100233690094513715434,From beginning to end, I was extremely pleased with this office overall. Scheduling [A++]: I had to setup an appointment via online form/e-mail; as I work at night and am generally asleep the entire time the office is open. I had a reply at 9:15am the morning following my first submission for an appointment, and every time I sent another e-mail after that a reply was received within 30mins [after the office had closed for the evening]. Office Visit [A+++]: I arrived for a 9am appointment, at 8:50am and was already seeing the physician [Dr. Prapta] at 9:10am, after the initial paperwork and other items performed by the optician. Price/Fees [A++]: I don't have vision coverage on my health insurance from work, so I purchased the [TSO Vision Plan] for $10, which gave me 20% off all office visit related items [check-up/etc] and 25% off all Lenses/Frames. The 25% off on lenses/frames is not restricted, so it applies to any and all lenses/frames they carry or order. I bought a pair of oakley frames w/transitions; and they applied the discount. 3 years ago when I purchased my current oakley's with transitions from Pearle Vision, they did not allow any promotions/discounts to be applied to the more expensive brands like this. I priced the frames/lenses that I purhcased from this office online w/3 different online retailers and I paid $150-$160 less than I would if I had purchased them online, like I originally planned to. Customer Service [A+++]: I work in a medical office, and am very keen on how all the staff in medical offices can act. Some are less savory than others. However, this office is run in a very professional manner and all the staff were extremely nice. I hadn't planned on purchasing my new glasses from this office. After speaking with the optician for a few minutes, I decided to purchase them here. He was very knowledgeable and, didn't hesitate to tell me where spending more money wasn't necessary in regard to the lenses. They don't work on commission like some of the chain stores do; so he was more than objective in keeping my overall cost down. I will definitely return to this office in the future for any further optometry needs. If you want a good experience with your optometry needs, you need not look further.]
