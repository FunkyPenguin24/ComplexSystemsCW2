[115677342927189871850,100702879592001440739,We have really enjoyed our membership - taken great trips we definitely would not have taken otherwise. We "gifted" our kids with their choice of weekend trips for their birthdays one year and I can guarantee you, they will remember those birthdays more than they'll ever even *think* about some cheapy toy they got for other birthdays and probably broke within a few days. We traveled to Sun River/Bend, OR, Ocean Shores, WA, Idaho near Silverwood Theme Park, and enjoyed our wedding anniversary in beautiful Lake Tahoe, CA, and those were all just "local" places we could drive to. There are many many other places we have in mind to travel to once we can afford to add in airfare to the plans. :)]
