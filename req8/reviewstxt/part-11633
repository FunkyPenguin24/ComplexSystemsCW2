[104799845606636465545,100781934353274682877,My girlfriend and I had 2 completely different experiences. My experience: I love my personal trainer, he motivates and encourages me to do my best. He never forgets what my goals are and he's pushing me to try new exercises, which is something I needed because I was addicted to free weights. My girlfriend's experience: Her personal trainer would forget about their sessions, came up with excuses/lies and would constantly forget her phone number even after she would call/text him to confirm their sessions. She gave up and discontinued her service and her membership. The only reason why I am no longer continuing my business with them is because I can no longer afford it vs my girlfriend who had a terrible experience and was not getting the service she wanted.]
