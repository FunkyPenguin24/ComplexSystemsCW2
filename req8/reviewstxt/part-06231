[112324045882485523491,100488944245073377854,I stumbled across Pappadeaux Sunday Brunch a few months ago and I am addicted! If I keep this up I will weigh 300 lbs but I love it! LOL Everything on the brunch is delish...with no "tasteless filler" items like at so many other brunches/buffetts. I have found it to be one of the very best in town and well worth every penny. The service is great and I just dont think you can beat it anywhere. Enjoy!]
