[108361168102198821922,100530303997498476066,What a great experience! I have shopped a five state region for months, in order to find the perfect 'Vette at the right price, and when I found it at Cable-Dahmer, my concern shifted to whether or not the dealership or salesman would get in the way of a sale. Isn't that typically the case?? Not so with Joe! He "read me" over the phone, knew I was a serious buyer and dealt with me in a highly professional way. He quickly responded to my every need, was respectful of my time constraints and circumstances, and worked hard to get to the bottom line. Very surprisingly, he was even able to beat my credit union rates on the financing. All said, I picked up my 427 yesterday, and Joe made it one of the easiest deals of my life! A special car deserves first rate knowledge, detail and attention, and that is exactly what Joe provided. Though I don't expect to purchase another 'Vette, if I do, I will look no further than Joe in KC! Gary Oklahoma City, OK]
