[101203520744588397530,100649846397072843171,I wanted to share my experience with Amanda at Salon NV. Let me first say that I have extremely fine, thin hair and I change my color and cut about as often as I change my mind! I first discovered Amanda at Outback Hair over 5 years ago and knew instantly that she would be doing my hair from that point on. I got my hair cut, colored, highlighted and deep conditioned today and am thrilled with the result. I stopped by my office afterwards where my boss (who has impeccable style) stopped and asked me who did my hair because it looked fabulous! She said the colors blended so well in fact, that she was rethinking her hair color she had just received in Highland Village! Amanda is professional, kind, extremely knowledgeable and always friendly. As for me and my hair, we will NEVER go to anyone else!!!]
