[111086464951874532371,100006898830440027491,I was very pleased to secure a great deal and bring home my new 2013 Escape SE! Renee Weeks and Chris Boan treated me royally. They really demonstrated that they were interested in fitting me with a vehicle that was right for MY needs. With the "Wear and Tear" program, I felt comfortable commiting to a leased vehicle which had always disappointed me with other dealerships. Service also, with this dealership has always been outstanding, so this makes my second new car at Szott a double win! Continue to care about the best interest of your customers as you have, and you'll keep my business and anyone I can refer to you.]
