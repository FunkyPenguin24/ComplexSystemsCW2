[100419644071985465299,100671399402441049970,When I stumbled across this restaurant, I really had no idea what to expect. Portlanders certainly do not think of the Milwaukie area when considering a night of fine dining. They are missing out if they overlook Amadeus Manor. The food is wonderful and the service is terrific. The pace is VERY relaxed, so you actually are able to enjoy an exceptional appetizer before your meal arrives. The view of the Willamette as the sun sets is not to be missed.]
