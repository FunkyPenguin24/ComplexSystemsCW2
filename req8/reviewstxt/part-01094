[104902969613290736625,100215477935016106155,I recently took my cat in here because he got sick because I'm an idiot (I will admit it). Anyway, they took him back and tell me what's going on and how to fix it....The vet tech comes back with a HUGE number of $700 for an iv, sedation, meds, an overnight stay, and who knows what else(he only needed the IV and some medicine for me to bring home). And said if they didn't do all of that stuff to our cat that he would very likely die! I told them I couldn't afford $700 because I'm a student and they offered me a credit line, which I also did not want to do because once again I'm a student with enough debt. So the vet tech gets really huffy with me and basically acted like I was the worst person in the world for not being able to afford an outrageous bill. So after he talked with the vet they came up with the magical number of $200 (which was probably still too much....) for the visit, IV, and take home medicine. My cat is fine now with just the IV and his medicine , but they WILL take advantage of you if they can. They will guilt trip you and treat you like you're just awful for making a mistake. I would not recommend anyone take their animal here unless you just have to--and even then be careful to not get taken advantage of! Update: I am going to go ahead and say that they don't know what they are doing at this vets office because they prescribed my cat the same dosage of muscle relaxers that you would give a HUMAN THAT HAD BACK PROBLEMS. A 15 lb cat! He hasn't been able to walk straight all day and my dad who is a doctor said that he definitely should not have been given or continue to get that dosage (or even that medicine). So my cat has been 'drunk' (but not seizing......) for nearly 24 hours now. Thank you vet clinic.]
