[100986262569269951392,100710700363061655461,Let's cut to the chase. Dr. Curry is a miracle man. And a really great guy too. Four years ago I pinched a nerve in my back/neck. After epidurals, an osteopath and physical therapy, I went to East Bank Chiro desperate for relief. Within a week I was in relief and essentially "cured" after about 3 months. I continued with regular adjustments for another 9 months but for some reason stopped going. Never-the-less, these guys put me right and I carried on for another 2+ years pain free. About a month ago I started having hip pains and literally 10 days ago I had very limited mobility in my hip. The pain was level 8-9. My first port of call was East Bank Chiro and Dr. Curry. I got almost instant relief, but the xray found that one hip was half an inch lower than the other, the source of my pain. At 48, my body needs some attention and TLC and the treatment is working. In two days I am going skiing with my 16 year old son and I am ready to go - something I didn't think would be possible 10 days ago. I realize this is just a necessary part of my life now and I will make sure I receive regular adjustments from now on. The staff are great. The office is nice and comfortable. And I always get in and out in half an hour or less. These guys have all the xray and muscle measurement tools in house and they are professional and welcoming. Highly recommend. A+++++]
