[112770152641718057558,100790074985913909142,Greg, a master mechanic and the Flying Dog owner, and Dan, office manager and the master of ceremonies, are a pair of the nicest, smartest, most hardworking guys you'll ever meet. They can't help but do right by you and your car. They know more about your car than you ever will, but they'll never make you feel dumb about that simple fact, and you'll never doubt that you're getting the best automotive service in southwest Michigan. They take the painful sting out of the second-most difficult exchange of goods and services known to man or woman: auto repairs. (First-most difficult: haircut.) On top of it all, they're fun-loving. They're the Penn and Teller of auto repair (Greg is Teller), amusingly dispelling the illusion and trickery of what other shady mechanics do, or don't do. For the past three years, in addition to any repairs we've needed, we've also driven all the way from Bedford Township, 40 minutes one way, just to get our oil changed and visit with them. The better you get to know them, and the better they get to know your car, the more you come to realize you'll never again need, or want, another mechanic.]
