[104852587781714549489,100419851872294818880,Going on our 3rd year with Abstract!!! Dr. S (my employer) and myself go once a week and have been more than pleased. I have utilized the synergy service, had facials and have worked out consistently. We have found that we are able to accomplish more being stronger and feeling better then when we forced ourselves to go to other gyms. The trainers and techs have been efficient, caring and professional on every level not to mention fun and understanding. They encourage and motivate without making you feel defeated. I never thought we would be able to stick to something as long as this but are so glad we have and feel we will continue for a long time to come. Thanks Ken and Robin for your vision.]
