[101314656388970105377,101010934257948460231,My wife and I finally had the opportunity to eat at Swan Oyster Depot and it was worth the 1-hour-plus wait in line. The sashimi of ahi, albacore and scallops in olive oil with chopped red onions and capers was delicous, as was the smoked trout and smoked salmon; the kumamoto and blue point oysters; the combination seafood cocktail of bay shrimp and dungeness crab meat topped with a plump oyster and a boiled shrimp; the little neck clams with green pepper mignonette; and the crab butter (the guts of a dungeness crab served in the shell with a little water, turning the fatty, crabby innards into a delicious broth that was delectable on pieces of sourdough bread). Guy, Steve, Kevin and the guys were great hosts. We had a great time and a great meal.]
