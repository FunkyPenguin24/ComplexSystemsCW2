[108103887326189468125,100502336193135732239,My student records were given to the National College Advisory Board, and now every single college demands my transcripts from this school, although I only attended for some vocational courses I never ended up completing. When I tried to inquire about it I was not met with informed people, and I still have not had a conversation about my rights to privacy, before I was indoctrinated into this database, which does not serve the interests of students, only the institutions, as if they need any help. When I called the school I was told that the lady I needed to talk to was out of her office, so I went to the school and when I got there she was in her office and very stand offish with me, and told me that we could talk about my issue in the hallway, to which I responded "That is unprofessional" and so I demanded some answers in a professional setting. I was very surprised, but these people are hiding things from the public with the way they handle your education. Don't be surprised if you do poorly here that it will follow you like a ball and a chain for the rest of your life.]
