[106105596568817072702,100546922439973103045,I HATE even giving this company one star. They deserve none. After dealing with their unreliable, inaccessible, and rude landlord (named Libby), they are STILL only creating problems for me. They refused to take care of any maintenance, they never got back to my emails or phone calls, and they charge far too much for it to be worth it. After discovering black mold on the ceilings and under the carpet downstairs, it took them MONTHS to even return my call. My health suffered the entire year since I have already had sinus/respiratory issues my whole life. All three of my roommates at the time also suffered symptoms- none of which were any of Oak tree's concern. They have now cashed an old security check of mine from over a year ago that I already paid. I just had to fight to get hundreds of dollars back, and now I'm still trying to get reimbursed for overdraft fees. IF I CAN SAVE ANYONE from dealing with what I did (and still am) because of Oak tree- it would at least make it seem to me that a LITTLE good could come from this fraudulent encounter with a horrible company.]
