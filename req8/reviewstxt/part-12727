[114053270785331190934,100841620593880954608,Faith Redemption Center is an excellent place to worship and fellowship with People who really love God, His Word, and others. Worship services are vibrant and heartfelt, while the speakers there minister directly from the Bible. The FRC family is Pentecostal in nature, and conveys a deep belief in the power and necessity of the Holy Spirit, which effected the resurrection and empowers believers today to live Godly in this present world. Superintendent Clyde Jones Jr. and 1st Lady Missionary Barbara A. Jones founded the FRC ministry in 1987, and although they have moved to a much larger Church Building, It continues to be a "Spirit Filled" "family oriented" Church where the Love of Christ is richly felt and shared. The Faith Redemption Center has a saying..."Once you have walked with us, You have truly walked in Faith." Come visit the FRC family for a joyous time in the Lord.]
