Just off the link road, this store has a drive through (the first in the UK), it's open and airy inside, with a patio if it's not raining. Consistently good coffee and food, well stocked and the barrista's aren't hard on the eye either. Staffed by fairly young people, the staff are friendly and bubbly lending a real kick to the atmosphere.]
