[101487855970606127754,100686754836509901745,I purchased a 2013 Honda Pilot EXL. This was far and away the best experience I have had purchasing a car. I was able to take care of most of it over the phone. I had to sell my old 2004 Odyssey before I could proceed and I never felt pressured to take care of that quickly. Joey White was very responsive and gave me a fair and great quote right from the get go. What I really appreciated was the fact that there were not hidden fees in the quote. Other dealers were not this upfront. Everyone I dealt with was extremely nice and professional. I have recommended this place to all of my friends.]
