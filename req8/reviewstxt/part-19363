[105072907772915330688,100025919562304271242,He was a good doctor but his receptionist lacks in responsibilities (ignorance isn't an excuse) Dr.Harter is a pill pusher to many people that sells their meds on the streets. After looking into this allegations Dr. Harter has made some of bad moves that isnt fair to his minority patients. urine samples are never sealed,so any urine sample can become contaminated along the way to the lab. Patients are asked to leave sample in rest room with no labels no way to know whose urine is in which cup. This doctor wouldn't make it with any medical group with these practices. i was discharged from this doctor cause I know hes a dirty doctor and its just a matter of time before someone else challenges him in a court of law. True story Dr. Harter gave 2 gentleman prostate exams in exchange for Norco 7.5 one patient didnt have any medical records to support any claims of being in pain or to receive any pain meds. Fell sorry for the guys that was violated but they was also busted for pain meds Dr. Harter provided to them]
