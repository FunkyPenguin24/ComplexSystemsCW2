[112713162831198467392,100529352559082740546,I'm not sure why some people are having issues. I've been in there several times and the owners have always been helpful to me. The last time I went in there to get help removing a site screw that was stripped and he did it for free. I have purchased one gun from them and looked up others and their prices are around the same as others that I've seen. It's not like we live in an area with a huge population and a lot of competition.]
