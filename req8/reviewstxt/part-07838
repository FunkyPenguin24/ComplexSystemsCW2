[115377909329840908664,100579451122675206419,This is a review strictly of the quality of experience working out in this Gold's gym compared to other Gold's gyms in Utah (not contracting or sales, which I've been deceived with in the past, but that's not the focus of this review. Read every piece of the contract before you sign it!). This gym is AWESOME because although the machines are a little crowded for my taste, of all the gyms I've been to, this is the least "go there to be seen" gym. The aerobics room is separate on its own floor. What does that mean? Dudes can't park themselves in front of a machine for an hour to check out the girls doing stripper hip hop, or to try to get them to notice their steroid-enhance body. Same deal with treadmills: they face the window, and while there are machines next to it, most other Gold's have the treadmills facing machines so guys will try to show off on those machines. It's seriously pathetic--it's the WORST at the Gold's in Orem (9th east). Seriously, go just for the experience. Like at 5 or 6pm. Last, they have a basement floor with even more machines spread out into various rooms, so you go down there to actually lift and not to posture or socialize. This gym also seems way less crowded than the Gold's in Orem (both) or American Fork. Whenever I'm around SLC and haven't worked out, I go to Sugarhouse. So to sum up, the machines or gym aren't particularly new or nice, but of every Gold's I've been to in Utah, this is the best for people who actually go to work out. I like to get in a zone and work out hard, and this is the best place for that.]
