[104340929845143692186,101086867274243912282,"You can grow a day in a year, or a year in a day..." This is a phrase that I have heard more often at Brett Manning Studios in the last few weeks. When getting vocal coaching from Brett or any Associate in the studio the latter is true. Most singers have a breakthrough every time they come into the studio. The technique is so easy and allows for so much freedom and enlists vocal coordinations that haven't been thought about since you were a child. I know you've heard of the "primal / functional fitness" trend, well, this is Primal Voice (voce primordiale for my italian friends or students of classical voice). This back to basics approach to singing has created vocal freedom in singers who thought all hope was lost for them because of poorly trained technique. Another huge facet of Brett Manning Studios is the concentration on artistry. All of the coaches will ensure that whatever you sing stays true to the song while never compromising technique. On an administrative note, the staff has always been very caring and helpful for whatever I needed. There is always amazing vocal tea available and a full range of voice related supplements for you to enjoy. The general vibe of the studio is wonderful and exactly what you would expect from Music City. If you're looking for some vocal coaching my recommendation could not be stronger. It doesn't matter if you think that you can't sing or if you've been singing for years. The experience you have here will make you a better singer, no matter what!]
