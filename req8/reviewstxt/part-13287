[118251124141517977665,100873574403499197424,My car purchasing experience from BMW of Sterling was absolutely wonderful. Often times being a young women I am not treated at car dealerships and shops as fairly as a grown man. Not at this dealership. They treated me with dignity and respect, a respect that I can trust them with all of my car needs. Jim Eddie has been the service manager of my car for 11 years, and he was over the top helpful and also put me in the hands of Karl Mackey, who helped me with my new car purchase. Both gentlemen are personable and friendly, but also professional and extremely knowledgable. Not once were they pushy and/or arrogant, which I truly appreciated. After my car purchased, they called a few days later to see how everything was going with the car and myself. This was an extremely nice and sincere gesture. I highly recommend these gentlemen and the dealership.]
