[105127146950552179993,100193318148762566340,We ordered flowers for a friend that just lost her mother. We took a collection at work, and paid $75 for the flowers. The arrangment could have been done by a child. It looked like a couple of grocery store "bunches" were just stuck in a vase. When a co-worker called to express her disapointment, the owner was very defensive and said we got what we paid for. The 100% satisfaction guarantee was not honored. We would have been better off going to a grocery store, buying the flowers and arranging them ourselves. We will never buy/order flowers from here again - I am sure they do not need our business.]
