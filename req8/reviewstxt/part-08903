[117376099947344396507,100633377132845074184,The Ultimate Dining Experience last night would have been a great event had we picked a different restaurant. Dining at Russel's Smokehouse ruined our entire experience for the night. Service was terrible (we had to get up from our table to request dinner, desert and our check). We also only ordered food for two people which consisted of a plate of potato chips, calamari, salad and a dinner entree and had been charged $180!! For one SINGLE PLATE of each item. Charging $45 for a plate of potato chips is beyond me. Had the server explained this, we would have not ordered from here at all. I am recommending for the next Dining Event not to make reservations at Russel's Smokehouse.]
