[108482824867881942838,100391106336987177653,Terrible Service Food was Sub Par did not taste like restaurant quality Went to dinner for my nieces birthday dinner and ordered the lobster ravioli and crab cakes and Cesar salad . mind you the price is $ 34.00 they brought me three small ravioli and 2 looked like 2-3 ounce so called crab cakes . i asked the waiter if this was lunch portions and he said no this is dinner portions . i then informed him i was not happy with this meal and wanted another . He told me oh well maybe they should put pictures on the menu. I then told him no they don't need to put pictures but for these exuberant prices they need to portion the food accordingly . i have eaten this same combo at many of the finer establishment and the portions were double and often times less expensive . i will never go to this establishment again and will never recommend this place. Stay Away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!]
