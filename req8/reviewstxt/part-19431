[109786011271066421092,100029351624351003875,Best store ever! A kids paradise! They have all candy new and old, along with homemade truffles, marshmallows, and chocolates! If I could go there every day I would! And they are at the Iowa State Fair under the grandstand! The best part is the staff, they are all nice, easy to work with, and so friendly! They have every candy you could think of plus more! If you have any occasion, holiday, or just want some candy go to Beaverdale confections!]
