[112368921579534180643,101061314734954883829,Have been to ashiana a few times and found the food to be excellent, I have tried a range of different options and all have been good so far. The speed of service both in the restaurant and for takeaways is really good. Staff are in general really competent although I have had a bad experience recently with one who seemed totally out of it, although he has been a one off in my experience.]
