[109820672739239435177,100984415509128684660,Sent my Galaxy S4 into RockIT Repairs right before Christmas. They gave me two options on the repair and I chose the LOCA for $134.99 as it seemed to be the best quality repair after talking to the technician. They were very informative and my baby made it back to me in less than 4 days, now that's what I look for in service! I will definately be using them again even though I live in California and they are in Virginia. -Archer]
