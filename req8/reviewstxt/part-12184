[111894670868776610101,100811025522241705865,Love the shop. I discovered the art of Eric Ravillious in there. They've got some reproductions of his superb watercolours as well as some of the books published by James Russell. The objects in the shop seem to be carefully chosen. Great for gifts or simply to indulge.]
