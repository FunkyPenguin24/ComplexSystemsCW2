[103226278443909492714,100085908712939030027,Mike and I have been coming to this bar since we moved just north of downtown Osseo in 1997. It's friendly, open, entertaining plus the wait staff is tops. The food is very good and the burgers are outstanding. Stop by on the weekend for breakfast and have a bloody marry which we think is one of the best in town. I can hardly wait for St. Patrick's day every year because their corn beef and cabbage menu item is out of this world! Down home folk that own the place who know how to have a good time and are involved with the community. So pop on by and check the place out and see for yourself.]
