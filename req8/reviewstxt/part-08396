[107558157359487438074,100608654303069568777,Bill Kidd’s Volvo Service is a class act from start to finish. I like the capability to set up a service online; to be able to add a comment on that online service request to clarify my particular concerns and requests is a significant plus. The website capability is great. Dean Marino is an outstanding service representative. He is knowledgeable, thoroughly professional and has a great personality to deal with customers. Bill Kidd's Volvo service has a great asset in Dean. I like the fact that the service done on my vehicle was not just limited to what the manual says, but the technician did a thorough inspection of my vehicle, reported the inspection results to Dean and then Dean made recommendations to me on what should done. I am confident that the work recommended was necessary; I didn't feel undue pressure to agree to the recommendations and felt free to say no to anything I did not want done. Bill Kidd’s performed the service in the time promised, the loaner car process was effortless and convenient and the vehicle operates 100% following the service. I would definitely recommend Bill Kidd’s Volvo Service to anyone.]
