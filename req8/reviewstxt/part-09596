[106760953790783929682,100671637026101725099,So we showed up on a rainy night wearing flip flops and rain coats as one might when they didn't want to ruin their clothes. The bouncer successfully extorted $10 from me because I wanted to get in but was not willing to wear leather shots that would be ruined on the rain. Then because we weren't going to spend the table fee of $150 to sit at a patio table we were relegated to the back. Moving along...this must have been the only hookah bar I've ever been to that didn't serve tea. The shisha was great to be fair. The music, horrendously repetitive house.]
