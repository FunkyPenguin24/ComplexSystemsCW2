[112019545436261699698,100922191419330641523,I paid over the odds for next day delivery from Amazon and then waited in next day…All damn day. I don’t know about you but I find that really, really annoying and makes my blood boil. What a waste of a whole day. It really gets my goat when you call HDML at Mitcham at 1800 hours after you’ve been in, since you got up that morning waiting for the delivery, that you paid extra for and they tell you a delivery was attempted at 1400, but you were out? I said to the woman, why would I pay the extra fee to have next day delivery and then go out? It doesn’t make sense. Also, as a previous reviewer has stated here, once they’ve got your number in their system, they won’t pick up. I can confirm her suspicions are true. All you can do is call and call and call and nothing happens. But the moment you call from another number, they pick up and speak to you. Another worrying aspect of this rinky-dink HDML outfit is that when being jerked around by a deceitful driver, I used to be able to resort to Jessop’s or Jacobs click & collect service. But now that Amazon (and others, to be fair) have put most of the decent retailers out of business, we’re completely at the mercy of totally useless, rinky-dink outfits like HDML who don't give a hoot for their or any anybody else's customers. If this is an indication of how trends are changing regarding our purchasing preferences, and now that the decent bricks and mortar retailers are failing all around us, we’ve now found ourselves completely at the mercy of the delivery companies who treat us with complete and utter indifference and don’t give a damn if we’ve paid extra for one day delivery or not. Amazon’s locker system was my first choice, only to be told my parcel was too big and that I would need an alternative delivery system. They’re not wrong with that suggestion, are they?]
