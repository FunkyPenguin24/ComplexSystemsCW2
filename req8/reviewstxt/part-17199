[101616555635502106045,101087061028363531448,TERRIBLE service. TERRIBLE sales. You have been warned. We purchased two cars here, had both serviced regularly and had terrible experiences every time. If you want to get nickle and dimed on your purchase and waste half your day waiting for a simple oil change then Priority Toyota in Chespeake is the place to go!]
