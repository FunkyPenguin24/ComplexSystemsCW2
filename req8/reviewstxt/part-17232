[117948428120273819325,101088556484275507397,Being new to the area, I was recommended to Readington Auto & Tire by a work colleague. I have four cars that I maintain and have been here many times for both repairs and routine maintenance and always received great service and good advice. I have never felt any "upsell" pressure during routine maintenance, and when a repair was necessary they were clear and honest about what work needed to be done (vs. what could be put off or wasn't necessary). Will be back, thanks!]
