[117114807151670714805,100127546889108925093,I purchased a new Nissan in '10 and it was the most pleasant auto buying experience I have had in my life. I have purchased many autos in the 45 plus years that I have been driving. So I decided to return to Hoselton to purchase my 2013 Nissan Altima. I hoped that the previous experience was not a once in a lifetime experience. Well, it was not! This experience exceeded my expectations. My sales consultant, Nick Cooper, was a pleasure to work with. He made my most recent auto buying experience quite enjoyable. The Hoselton Nissan staff really go out of their way to serve their customers! I got a fair price for my trade and an excellent price on my new Nissan. Hoselton really has the auto buying experience nailed! I would recommend Hoselton Nissan to anyone in the market for a new or preowned vehicle. I know that I will return to Hoselton for all my future automobile needs.]
