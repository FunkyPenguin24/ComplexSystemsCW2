[111263908545228425010,100723598035617768760,Recently I purchased an iComfort mattress from Mattress Capital and couldnâ€™t be more pleased. They were very friendly and helpful without a high pressure sales mentality. I had been sleeping on a very inexpensive mattress for about 8 years during a period of frequent moves. Now that I have settled down I felt it was time to get a better mattress. I chose the iComfort which is a moderately priced mattress. From day one my sleep improved so much that it is hard to quantify. I really did not know what a good nights sleep was until I purchased this mattress. My biggest disappointment was that I did not purchase a mattress of this type earlier.]
