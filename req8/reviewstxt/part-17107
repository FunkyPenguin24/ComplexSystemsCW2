[117042874211542673020,101081966308297010861,I been looking for good Asian food locally and I finally found a restaurant that's pretty good. By the title of the restaurant you wouldn't know it serves Thai food as well. We tried the drunken noodles, green curry and spring rolls on our first order. Our food was ready to pickup in 15 minutes and was really delicious. Excited to have such good Thai food close to home. Will definitely be ordering from here again soon.]
