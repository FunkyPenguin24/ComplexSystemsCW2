[109963349907040513325,100821750279719658021,I purchased takeout for myself and friends when they were helping me move into my new house in Barnstead and had my girlfriend pick it up. They were really nice to her, respectful, and even brought all the pizzas out to the car. They also provided information on other great services in the area. Not sure about the interior because I didn't go, but great food at a great price and very friendly people!]
