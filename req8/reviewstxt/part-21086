[117416703740236609236,100117554575023393720,July 7, 2013~We've been here several times & go for the fajitas mainly. Today ... they were horrible! Ordered 1 chicken & 1 Beef...completely overcooked! Both dried out, onions burnt on the dinner plate cuz it was super, super hot plate! AWFUL! More like jerky...no juices/no moisture and lots of unchewable parts to the beef. I think they changed their meat supplier??? IF YOU DO GO...MAKE SURE TO order your Fajitas Medium RARE or something cuz they'll keep cooking on your metal plate! Was really disappointed :o( Service was fine tho & well, the decor? Oh well, it is what it is. We'll try again someday, but will specifically order food MED. RARE.]
