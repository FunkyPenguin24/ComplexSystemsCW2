Even in the larger space of the new campus, it has the same home feel of Eastside. The leadership seems committed to reaching new people and those who are far from God. In addition their global teams and local compassion efforts are helping to bring hope into every corner of orange county. If you are looking for a place to feel at home, meet new people, and be part of something that is committed to changing the world .... come check out Eastside Christian Church.]
