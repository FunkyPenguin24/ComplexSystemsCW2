[116854676068960567449,100974095056512607596,My Lease was about to expire in 2 months I leased a Ford Edge 2010 before. I went back to Ford dealer to shop around for a new car, spent 4 hours there order the car then the following week I was told that my car was sold to someone else, it was very upsetting. Then I went to Mercedes dealer and talk to Lauren Singer she explained in details all different models to me; I told her I was going to think about it and come back another day. Then I had a death in the family and I did go to many dealers to check for cars. I was going to buy my Edge and due to high monthly payments for an old car; I decided to buy a new car. I did go back to Mercedes dealer and talked to Ms. Singer again and I did go to a test drive GLK and another sedan. I really liked the GLK, the dashboard and the full power AC (aviator style), quiet, smooth to turn around, etc. It was a difficult decision between the 2 models but I am glad I did get the GLK a family car. My kids loved it! My son and his friend like the dealer so much and Ms. Singer he told me when he grows up he wants to work there lol. Ms. Singer explained in details the difference between the models and I bought the car. If you are a women trying to decide on a new car go talk to her; she is great!]
