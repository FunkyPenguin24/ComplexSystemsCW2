[109279082042607373838,100025939469263684234,I am a professional from out of state working here in Columbia and decided to go out for a drink with a few co workers after work. I was rather enjoying myself listening to the mediocre band and sipping my overpriced poorly mixed drink when I decided to go outside to get some air with a co worker. My co worker finished his cigarette and we were headed back into the bar when a Nottingham's bouncer with a Napoleon Complex and too much to prove decided to not let me back into the bar. I begged and pleaded for an explanation as i hadn't been there long enough to tie one on when all of a sudden I was strangled and restrained to point where I could not breath then thrown to the ground. Needless to say this was assault and will be addressed by the authorities. Moral of the review, if you want to get assaulted by a 5'4 bouncer with "little man syndrome", this is place for you.]
