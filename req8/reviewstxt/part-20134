My kids are afraid of dogs and when the older of their 3 dogs cornered one barking at her the employees were less than apologetic. Saying (with my kid in tears mind you) "Oh sweetie he's not going to hurt you." and laughing it off. There was a smell of dog urine in the store where one of the dogs had peed in the corner and it wasn't wiped up until I alerted the staff. When they were alerted of it they proceeded to slap the 16 week puppy and rub his nose in it. I understand this is Austin and it's hip to have a shop dog. But the staff was rude, unprofessional and showed a complete lack of understanding of customer issues. I will be shopping elsewhere purely on the performance of their staff.]
