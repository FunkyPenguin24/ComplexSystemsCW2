[101200838385268635299,100992734978686264075,Fantastic restaurant! A wonderful Italian fine dining experience. Great service, great food, beautiful ambiance! Don't miss this if you're in the area! It may not look like much from the outside, but go on in and enjoy!! We started with the caprese, which was very fresh. My husband had the salmon, which was served over spinach with goat cheese. The combination of flavors was excellent and it was done to perfection. I had the ravioli with sage & butter sauce. It was very rich and flavorful. The texture of the homemade pasta was delightful. The only bad part was that I was too full for dessert.]
