[113262935708003615533,100270904826862540822,What a wonderful experience we enjoyed at Bob Evans last night! We were a bunch of Canadians celebrating our Thanksgiving with our children who live in Michigan. We gathered at the restaurant and informed the manager that we were here for "Thanksgiving". He had us seated in a private area where we leisurely savoured our turkey dinners. The food was outstanding! Turkey was absolutely scrumptious!! We so appreciated being able to linger and enjoy each other's company. The staff went out of their way to be friendly. This truly was the next best thing to being home. Thanks, staff at Bob Evans, for a fantastic Thanksgiving!]
