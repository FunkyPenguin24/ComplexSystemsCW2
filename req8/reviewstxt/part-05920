[102384861269434012918,100472638635680619038,I ran a training course here recently for a small group of Excel users from a national retail chain. The pre- sales support from Dan was excellent and his team were very helpful in ensuring all PCs were set up & ready for us. Lunch arrangements were very efficient & attention to detail was superb. Can't hesitate to recommend Mike Glaire (MD) & his whole team for a fabulous end-to-end experience. Looking forward to returning there soon.]
