[118118840001285523946,100890394243934871188,Great office. Enjoyed coming here for my cleaning and dental work. Nice staff. Super friendly. Don't forget to use the massage chair in the waiting room. It's free. Cleanest most beautiful bathroom in a office I have ever seen. They have and utilize all the latest and greatest dental equipment. No old school here! The Dr. Nguyen is fast and efficient. Super friendly and pretty receptionists quickly get you in and out with all paperwork. Highly recommended. ----- Return visit to get old fillings replaced. Done quickly and painlessly. No lingering issues. The next day, Dr. Nguyen actually called me to check in on me. Yes, the doctor called me. That's customer service. He's totally got my patronage!]
