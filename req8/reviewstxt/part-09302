[112690741728116781374,100655623575820008009,BEWARE! I would NOT recommend this place to anyone. They will tell you what you want to hear just to get you to sign the contract, then they don't care. Find another gym...trust me. After doing what was asked of me to cancel my membership due to moving out of state, they have now sent my account to collections for over $620. And the company they use for this, Internal Credit Systems, is a guy named Ted that basically refuses to let you talk and hangs up on you.]
