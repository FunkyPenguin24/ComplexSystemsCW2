[116518895137478089734,100946561542195690048,The food and service at Moody's is top notch. The menu has changed a little over the past few months/year but its really dialed in! If you haven't been lately or are looking for THE spot in Truckee while passing through make sure to check them out. Top picks on the menu; best burger in town, awesome steak frites, truffle oil french fries and the ahi appetizer is killer.]
