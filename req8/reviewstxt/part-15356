[105905468645141950900,100984989681593661116,From Turkish olive oil soap to duck sandwiches and gluten-free treats, this market is a surprisingly pleasant detour from the hustle and bustle to urbane London life----transporting one's body and senses through multiple continents and centuries. I felt like I was meandering somewhere between a the freshness of a Los Angeles farmers market and the enduring wonder of an Arab souk. The only reason I did not give it full marks is that I am one who is quite adverse to crowds, so with understandable reasonable, this treasure close by the London Bridge draws a plethora of people from all walks of life. Another benefit is that there is a Monmouth Coffee house closeby---my favorite coffeeshop in Londontown]
