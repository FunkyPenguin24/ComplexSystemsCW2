[113975792270355893033,100528691451622413893,They were supposed to coordinate with us to trim our tree per an arrangement with our neighbor. He calls at 7:30am, leaves no voicemail and proceeds to chainsaw the tree at 9am on the same day. After confronting him about the lack of coordination he said he would cut anything he sees fit and there was nothing we could do about it. Horrible experience, extremely unprofessional, argumentative, belligerent... there aren't enough adjectives to describe the level of disrespect shown by MNM Tree Service. Avoid at all costs!!!]
