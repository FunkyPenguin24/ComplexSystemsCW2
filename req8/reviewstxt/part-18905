[110388462343146234629,100001455760837628776,We cannot say enough about how great our experience was at Sonoma Grille. We went there for the first time to celebrate our 2 year wedding anniversary. Upon learning this, they presented us with a complimentary champagne toast, followed by a complimentary dessert after dinner. Our server was very helpful in helping us select a wine. We are not big wine drinkers, so she allowed us to taste 3 different wines and we found one we really liked. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and provided great recommendations. The food was delicious, very reasonably priced, and perfectly portioned. We will definitely go back again for special occasions!]
