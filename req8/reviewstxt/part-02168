[108561181752443418285,100270866962185586779,I have become so upset recently with medical offices and their constant focus on insurance and the hoops that they have to jump through to "treat" patients. They book 10 people every 5 minutes and you end up waiting hours. This place is the complete opposite. They are there to make you better and run it like a business because let's face it, too many are run FOR the insurance companies. Refreshing to have a place stick to a schedule and treat you like a human and not a number/insurance participant. I hope the serum works for me because allergies are no fun:)]
