[106554640243496374318,100314831444776743773,I stopped by here and *another* local gun store on Saturday and wow, what a difference. I used GunEnvy for a transfer awhile back and they did great, no problems. This trip was just for browsing for a new handgun and comparing models. The gentleman was extremely helpful and talked to me about the pro's and con's of different handguns without getting frustrated that I wasn't buying right then. This store is way more my speed. I was one of 3 customers there that morning, and I had their full attention. Any and all of my firearms purchases in the future will probably go through GunEnvy for a transfer or be purchased there. Great place, great guys, great atmosphere. This is how I would run a gun store if I had one.]
