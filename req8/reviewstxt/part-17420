[117322096396466533039,101099098020653051048,Great Experience! First time buyer and extremely satisfied! Michael Zheng, one of the sales managers at BMW of Rockville went above and beyond to get me into my first BMW. Being a first time buyer, i was nervous about leasing a car, but Michael and his team were great. If you're a first time buyer, stop by BMW of Rockville for a no pressure sales process and a great selection of BMW's.]
