[112896101479248731113,100037539968259078554,Went for a meal with my wife with no real expectations but walked (well, waddled) away very happy. The restaurant was lovely inside and the service was excellent. The real star, however, was the food which was absolutely delicious. I had focaccia and a delicious meat ravioli where the pasta melted in my mouth. Only downside was that it was bitterly cold outside and the draft from the entrance to the restaurant opening and closing was pretty off-putting.]
