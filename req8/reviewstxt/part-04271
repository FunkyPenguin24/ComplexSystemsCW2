[102380660577083561198,100385338924922680013,I've been a customer of Ron and Eric for many years now, having brought them a variety of cars with a variety of problems. Most notable would be my 1998 Jetta that plagued 911 Washington St all too often. I happened to live around the corner from the shop when I got this car, and would often have this awful car towed to their lot - and stroll in the following morning to let them know what it was doing there yet again. Its not that their repairs ever failed - this was truly a bad car. I've since moved on to a Subaru - and while I am a less frequent visitor now, I still trust only one shop with big jobs like brakes or even those mystery grinding/scraping noises. Ron and Eric are incredibly helpful and honest - it is very hard to find a shop like this - I'm sure glad I found it!]
