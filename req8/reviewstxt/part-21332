[114869896595102756285,100130743521089780351,Customer has not adressed any of these issues with shop managment,if any of these really exist.All repair work at this facility is warrantied by the facility and backed by AAA. Niether company has been imformed of any problem with this persons repairs. I would suggest if this really is a ligitimate problem that this person call Mikes Auto Body and Repair and speak to the owner John Gannon. I know he will be more than willing to listen to the situation and resolve any and all issues.]
