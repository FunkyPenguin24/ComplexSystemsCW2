[115856952827922121118,100053498275985592435,I have been going to Dr.Sabharwal with my dog Taz for years now and cant say enough good things about him. He helped Taz walk again! Dr.Sabharwal explained everything on how Taz would go through a ACL surgery and how the recovery would go and made me feel confident that my little guy was going to be fine. Now he runs the yard like a pup again thanks to Dr.Sabharwal.]
