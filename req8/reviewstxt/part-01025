[112912548833638324816,100212197554246895755,My experience at Computer Palace was exceptional. There was no pressure to upsale or marketing. They addressed my needs and gave me the freedom to attend to my immediate needs. I enjoy companies that are professional and respectful. On the other hand, big corporate businesses are always trying to add to the sale. You will not experience that here. I will go here for all my computer needs in the future. Sincerely, Michelle Howe]
