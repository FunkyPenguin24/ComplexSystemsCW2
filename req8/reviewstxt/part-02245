[116596934755699296261,100275180479916042662,My name is Chon Tarango and I am the office manager of LHBA. I was made aware of this review a few days ago and want to reply. First I would like to point out that James Morales has never worked for or with LHBA. No one here has any idea who James is. So I don’t see how James would have any idea what he is talking about. Employees filling out 1099’s? Our employees fill out W4’s and our subcontractors fill out W9’s. Not sure where lying to the IRS comes from. Volunteers? No volunteers at LHBA, we are all here to serve our clients and make money. Big bosses? Everyone is in the office every day so I’m not really sure what James is talking about. Hire and fire people every two weeks? This is simple, if you can't manage to show up to work every day on time or you can't keep up with the production requirements then we can't use you. Is this a new concept? As to the rest of James' review I'm not sure how to even respond. He simply has no idea what he is talking about. We are an insurance brokerage and sell many lines of insurance to people of all ages.]
