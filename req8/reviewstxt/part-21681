[100740310469672444192,100149874589855846675,When we arrived the hostess was cold and disinterested. At the first visit the waiter did not offer to get us drinks. The second visit he took our drink and food order. He was knowledgable about the menu. We did not see him again until dinner was served and never offered to refill our drinks. He stopped once to check on our meal and for about 20 minutes after our plates from dinner were served he finally asked us if we would like dessert. When he asked he did not have the dessert menu with him and assumed we had the menu memorized. He only asked one of the three of us in our party if they would like an after dinner drink, and once that person said yes he left to prepare the drink. As for the food it was very disappointing. I had the Union Square Louie. The hard boiled eggs were overdone so the yolks were green because of the released ferric oxide. The prawns were simply steamed and did not have any seasoning-- plus they were overcooked and chewy. The lettuce was drenched in dressing. Beyond overpriced for the quality. I will not return and I would not recommend anyone to this restaurant.]
