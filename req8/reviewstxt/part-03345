My goal was to get on the floor and play with my grandchildren and walk a little "further." And have you been able to do that? Yes I am. My future right now I think it's getting better because of the treatment I've been given here. And I'm very happy. The staff is great. They are here to help you. Very concern on your condition when you come in everybody is different but the doctor was concern on mine. And it just great everybody is just totally friendly and helpful and I'm happy. I tell them if they have a back pain check and see Illinois Back Institute. They can help you. And then from there pick up the phone and call Illinois Back Institute.]
