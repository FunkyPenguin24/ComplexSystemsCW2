[106409820719657291769,101102233270407962480,Awesome view. Rooftop restaurant was nice. Facilities in a state of disrepair however. Air conditioning was "working fine" but was not really cooling the room, was humid and hot with no escape. Only two lifts worked. Lobby seemed a bit smelly. Flies buzz around you in all but the rooftop restaraunt. Hookers haunt the steakhouse. But im fairly picky, its probably more bearable in colder months when the "working" AC isn't such an issue.]
