[108534506037940427942,101092932831986484058,I am a Affiliate school, located in Michigan, Have been involved in the martial arts for 33 years. I have found the experience with Shihan Steve Del Castillo to be FANTASTIC. He has given me the ability to teach my students great class with great student retention. The classes are always exciting, my adults love the Krav games that KMMA uses as warm ups and everyone has become very proficient at being able to defend themselves. Shihan Steve has provided everything he said he would and much more, he even created a custom lesson plan for me after I asked him a question how to do some gun control and disarms. He allowed one of my students to train at his school while on vacation. In my many years of experience I would say that Shihan Steve provides one of the best programs I have every used. He has made it very easy for us old dogs to learn new tricks. I have been with KMMA for almost a year now and he still impresses me with his program. I am very pleased to say what a great person Shihan Steve is and I know that I am blessed just by knowing him and his instructors. Thank you Shihan]
