[113105887634294620441,100017378056528661560,I just can't say enough about my business dealings with Bruce at Japan Auto Parts. He is a man of the highest integrity. He has stood behind his product above and beyond. His customer service is the best I have ever come across. Bruce always made me feel like he took a personal interest in my situation, and that I wasn't just a number or an inconvenience, and believe you me, my situation was definitely a frustrating one for all involved. I can say with absolute conviction you will be hard pressed to find anyone who is more honest, has better customer service, or stands behind their product more than Bruce at Japan Auto Parts. Not only that, but he is an absolute gentleman, and a pleasure to do business with. I would rate my experience as a 12 out of 10! With Many Thanks and Appreciation for all you've done. Sincerely, Kimberly Dyck]
