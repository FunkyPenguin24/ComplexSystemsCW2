[107012966350873267007,100032796461837679364,I've never eaten at the upstairs restaurant, but I've sampled some fare that was brought downstairs to the bar, at which I am becoming a regular. Okay, so the cocktails are lousy, but the atmosphere is cool. It's just a typical dive bar, but the Sunday night karaoke show is a blast! The DJ is funny and personable. There's plenty of bar room games, lots of pool tables, and a great local crowd. The bartenders are not the friendliest I've seen, but they are quick with the drinks. I love Fat Daddy's Bar, and I recommend it.]
