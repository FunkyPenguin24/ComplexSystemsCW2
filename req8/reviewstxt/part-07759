[116816382747398463098,100574685808090955573,On the coldest day this year, Rob Barnhill came out to greet me, show me several different models of Toyota's Rav4, took me for a test drive and then stayed late to help me move items from my car to my new Rav4. I appreciated the professionalism and was very thankful that there was no "hard" sales pitch, just lots of answers to my questions. George and Lin helped with the finances and final paperwork to send me home in my new Rav4. Thank you all! Stay warm.]
