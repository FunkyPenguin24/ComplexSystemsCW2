[100033236623775175018,100167629376852735537,It's rare to find a spot that both parents and their kids can enjoy at the same time. The “wind powered” Outer Banks Brewing Station is just such a place. On sunny days, parents can enjoy a brewed on site beer, while the young ones play on the pirate ship playground found in the brewery’s grassy backyard. I think that's the epitome of "Win-Win". I love the Lemongrass Wheat Ale and the Irie Tropic Stout. I wish I had taken more time to explore the food menu. I understand the Pho Night menu (each Thursday) is really good. Oh well, good reason for a road trip back to the beach!]
