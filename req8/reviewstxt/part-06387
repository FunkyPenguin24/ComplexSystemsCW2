[102558142713434930291,100497798182978271277,We purchased a fridge and stove from the location at Bowles and Wadsworth. We received extremely poor service from Eric Ashby. He failed to help us find a fridge that fit our dimensions, even though we had measurements with us. Eric failed to mention the amount of space needed for the doors to open, failed to mention the $15 extra we would be charged if it didn't fit in the front door, and didn't mention the re stock fee if we were dissatisfied with product, and failed to mention anything about the extended warranty. Great salesman huh!?! Called to complain, never heard back from manager(Nate), after leaving two messages, until he got an email forwarded to him from Corporate. Never will we use Appliance Factory Outlet for ANY appliance purchases!]
