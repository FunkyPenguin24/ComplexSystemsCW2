[112632420573925298212,100256345114567230376,First off, the hostess was terrible. The decorated interior is disgusting. The menu lacks description of food being served, also doesn't list regular drinks such as soft drinks. They have a lounge/bar but charge a cover of $10. The first basket of chips is free but if you want another it's $3 for each one. Salsa can not be so hot right away. In short this place is terrible. I didn't even eat the food or drink anything. If I was a food critic I would bring a gun and shoot myself. HORRIBLE!]
