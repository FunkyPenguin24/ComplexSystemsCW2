[101412898488007588701,100917573764758725413,I first started going to Midas because I had bought a coupon book. My brothers warned me not to, but I actually thought they did a great job. However after my recent exeperience I will not go back. I took my car there for Saftey and Emissions after another place I didn't trust failed me for brakes and window tinting. Midas also failed me for my window tinting. I had my windows checked by 2 different places that said I was within range (43% is the limit with a 3% variance, I was 40%). I tried to call Midas and ask them to retest it, told them what it said on UTAH.GOV. John on the phone was completely rude to me, said he remembered my car and they failed me and there was nothing he could do. I ended up going to the DPS to have them test it, they gave me an okay. I go back to Midas, after 15 minutes of push back... they realize they were inputting the tint numbers into my windshield (illegal to tint). So after wasting a week and half of my time, and being down right rude, all they had to say was "That's our bad." AND- Pretty sure they didn't even look at my brakes since they passed them saying I "obviously got them done." Nope, I didn't touch my brakes. Terrible customer service, and a waste of time/money.]
