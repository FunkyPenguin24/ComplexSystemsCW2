[107654770273894678437,100797844123366131924,Last week, I began my search for the vehicle I have been wanting to own for some time now. I searched many internet sites for a Pre-Owned Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited around the 2007, 2008 model years. A few came up, but the one that really caught my eye was a metallic olive green model with only 21K miles which was right in my price range. I initiated contact through the web with the dealership and within minutes I got a response Lisa, an Internet Sales Consultant at Westbury Jeep. After a couple of email exchanges with Lisa, she set me up with an appoint for the next day to come and see the vehicle and to meet with one of the Sales Associates to discuss possibly buying the vehicle if I liked what I saw. The next day, I met with a gentleman by the name of Anthony Dinelaris SR and I'm glad I did! Anthony was not only an extremely knowledgeable saleman about not only his own product, but the car industry in general, and he made my experience at Westbury Jeep one that I will always cherish. Anthony took me to see the vehicle, answered all my questions and basically made the entire sales process an enjoyable experience. I wrapped up the purchase of my 2007 Jeep in 1 day and I truly thank Anthony, and everyone at Westbury Jeep for such a wonderful car buying experience! Respectfully, Mike Pierro]
