[115925263016639875612,100181879589444615866,I still remember the day when i stepped into the main gate of UET,taxila. The Journey towards the electrical department was full of mysteries. The fear of being ragged by the seniors and the excitement of studying engineering was disastrous. But time is a great healer. as time passed a fell in love with UET,Taxila and its belongings. The things that used to irritate me from the word go begin to be a source of sereneness. 2 years have passed by. Right now em 600 km far from UET,taxila sitting on my bed writing this review,enjoying the summer vacations but on the harsh side missing my University too. GoD Bless u UET,Taxila. May u prosper.
