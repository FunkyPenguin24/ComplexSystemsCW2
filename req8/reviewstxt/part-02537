Compared to other zoo's that i have been to, we could get so much closer to the 'action' so to speak and as a result it felt a lot more like a personal experience to us. Even though i do not have kids i can imagine that it would be a perfect place for a day out. A great variety of animals, some of which you simply do not see at other zoo's or wildlife parks. I will be sad if i dont go again this year! :P. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! A++]
