[108830743172088556783,100679277380659088972,As a Massage Therapist I am very passionate about my well-being and of those around me. I found like minded people in the staff at Pain Relief Rehab. As the result of a back injury, I went from being a therapist to being a patient. Thankfully, as a result of Dr. DaSilva's care, I was able to avoid back surgery and fully recover. I still maintain my wellness at Pain Relief Rehab & I highly recommend you treat yourself to the care you deserve and the care you will receive here. You're in "Good Hands" at Pain Relief Rehab!]
