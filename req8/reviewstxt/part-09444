[106785216987049607894,100663252662959289548,I started a new job in Washington DC. I had been here 2 weeks when the Transmission went out of my Buick Park Avenue. I had to get a tow from the Triple A, they are listed as an approved service center. I got the car to the lot, we knew I had a problem, but not yet how serious. Set me up for an appointment to look into the matter. Quick service, quick follow up, it turns out the transmission was completely shot. They offered one of the transmission repair facilities that they use often and offered to make tow arrangemnets to get the car there. The transmission work, rebuild and installation was going to cost more the car was worth, I decided to sale the car to junk dealer. It took 5 days to work out all paperwork in Ohio and Virginia to get that accomplished. Never complained once about the car being on their lot, all of the time it took to fine, mail and register titles from one state to another. I felt sad about the Buick, it was like family, it was acar I used to do consulting all over hte Mid West and it did get here to the East Coast. The car had to dragged onto the tow truck, the transmission was that damaged; I go in the service area to pay my inspection fees, which is certainly in line with Ohio prices, much less DC Metro area prices and the Manager waved the fee. What a Blessing.]
