[111803291989732594222,100517253791502846737,Bad vibes.. I'll give them one more try. I live a few blocks away and love local shops. I've been riding bikes for years but road biking is new for me. The girl that works behind the counter was very short and dismissive of me the first time a few weeks ago and this most recent trip she was more overtly rude. I asked a very simple question which must be frustrating to someone that knows so much more about bikes than me. After looking at me for a few seconds like I'm an idiot she finally gave me a few condescending suggestions. I left as quietly as I came in but felt a little discouraged after my encounter. Hopefully she was just having a bad day, either that or I should wait until I'm an expert to shop there again.]
