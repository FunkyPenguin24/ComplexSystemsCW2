[100321175279921395624,100552995660178633883,Don't let these people's bad experiences ruin an oppurtunity to live in a decent area with comparably cheap rent. The location is prime. You are never further than 10-15 minutes from anything in Columbia with the close highway exits. The neighborhood is not dirty. There are no "hoodlums" hanging out at all times of the night. I heard of some breakins around the complex but the tenents in my building and I have never had any issues. There are multiple security guards at the facility gate and from what I can see, most everyone is either military or working individuals who just want to come home to peace and not cause any for anyone else. Maintenance could be better but if you go to the front office and force their hand, so to speak, you'll get your problem worked out promptly. The sad thing about reviews is only people who have a bad experience usually writes them. If everything is fine, then people don't. Well I'm someone who thinks everything is fine and you have nothing to fear living in Greenbrier. ***Note**** Live on the top floor if you can. No one living above you and better ceilings.]
