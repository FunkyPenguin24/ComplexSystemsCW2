[113052554794624559912,101011122230393225923,The friendly staff at Great Lakes Dentistry always make me feel comfortable and take good care of me. Dawn, the hygienist, always cleans my teeth so that they feel spotless and shiny. She's so gentle that I could take a nap in the chair, but fortunately her sense of humor keeps me awake and smiling. Dr Shawn thoroughly checks any x-rays and re-examines my teeth, guns and even tongue before giving me a clean bill of health. I leave feeling refreshed and satisfied knowing I've given my teeth the best care. Thanks to all of you at Great Lakes for continuing to make my visits pleasant, painless, and healthy.]
