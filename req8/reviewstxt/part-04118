[101384047613709027016,100376485215958711293,So at first sight, I didn't like the area that the place was in. But the inside was much better than the outer appearance. I really can't complain the washers & dryers were the newer up to date ones. I actually put way too much money in the dryer it dried my clothes in half the time I expected. And I had blankets & towels in there. Awesome!]
