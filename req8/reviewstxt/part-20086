[108595859019804707708,100065056895646062834,The first time I went to Cortello I immediately felt comfortable. I have always felt that when I walked into a salon everyone stared at you and never smiled! Not here! Everyone was super nice, smiled and made me feel like a person versus an alien. Not only is their customer service amazing, but everyone there does amazing hair. I cannot tell you how many compliments that I get. It is a little pricey for me, but it is worth every dollar for the amount of time they spend cutting my hair and really getting to know what I want. I have gone to Kayla, Lee and Tracy and can highly recommend all three of them!]
