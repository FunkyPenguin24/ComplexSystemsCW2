[104789339788370946830,100175848455229570566,After a pedicure here, I ended up in the hospital with an infection. After an investigation by the Board of Cosmetology, Forever Nails was fined for 20 serious health code violations, including the use of porous material on several customers, unclean foot baths and screens, and lack of hospital-grade disinfectant. Two of my nurses had also suffered from infections after pedicures at this location.]
