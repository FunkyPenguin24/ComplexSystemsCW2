[106879192432848925615,100118567619576747753,I had been visualizing myself in a new Altima for months so I already knew what trim I wanted. I used a certificate from TrueCar which led me to MJ Nissan. Tiffany reached out to me in the evening and we went back/forth on the phone all day after the exact trim I wanted was located at another dealership. Tiffany came & picked me up from my home about 5 miles from the dealership and was extremely friendly and responsive. Travis sold me the car, moving me very quickly through the paperwork process and onto Ken, both of whom were friendly, funny & professional. This was very important to me, because I'm not very patient, and Travis/Ken got me and out in an hour. The SL has a LOT of options and Travis took the time to show me how to start the car, use the navigation and all of the features before I left. Travis also scheduled my first service appointment before I left dealership. On a side note, it was my birthday a few days after my purchase and Travis was kind enough to send me a congratulatory text message. The team is very professional, friendly and although I won't be in the market for a new car soon, I will highly recommend others to this dealership.]
