[112517127062302460105,100715030717827587549,Would probably seem like a chain-type restaurant, if you're from the U.K. But if you're not, or have never been, you'll enjoy it. Has a pub-style decor and shows soccer (football) and rugby, etc. on its TVs. The food was good - and the service was fast and our waitress responsive. There probably was not anything that knocked my socks off and makes me die to come back here, but I would return.]
