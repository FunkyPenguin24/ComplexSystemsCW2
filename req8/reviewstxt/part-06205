[109933191527290127016,100487567791147947505,We stayed at your resort over the weekend for the very first time. I just wanted to bring it to your attention that as returning FL Key visitors for the last 12 years I was very disappointed in our stay. Marathon is where all my immediate family lives so you can image I visit the island numerous times a year staying at many locations. Our initial room when we checked into Banana Bay had a broken A/c. No air what so ever. After loading everything into this first room, bags coolers and our two year old we were VERY irritated after a 4 hour drive when we had to move again. Our second room the lady moved us to was just as bad with roaches and the smell of cigarettes and dog. I feel this was very unfair to us and the price for the rooms was not justifiable.]
