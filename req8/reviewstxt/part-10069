[102775858789749778590,100696954153932523881,Very laid back atmosphere great food. Highly recommended. I had the stuffed cheese Burger and sweet potato fries and it was delicious. My wife had the ceaser salad with blackened chicken. That was very delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant if your looking for something off the main strip and where the locals go this is the place.]
