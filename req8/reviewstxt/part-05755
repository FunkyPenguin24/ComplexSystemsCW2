[106687869595192497449,100464277980966367508,Went here after a debacle at "Greenhouse" in NYC. When arrived a guy tried to sell up passes for $25 versus the $35 price at the door. I didn't believe the $35 door price, but I found out when past the ID check line (I don't know if any else notice but everyone at the establishment do not know prices until your in the building. I find that to be just a moral flaw to the utmost.). When in the club they had a good vibe. All sorts going on inside. A lady walking around with a snake wrapped around her. My GF loved this. People walking on stilts. Also the temperature was nice in the building. My party pretty much stayed on the middle floor. The DJ was hit and miss. I say hit and miss because he would play hot songs, but either cut the mix right when the song got good, or he would talk through the record (really annoying in my opinion). Later through the night it was a good feeling. They even had a pizza shop inside the club and my girl got the hunger so I grabbed her a slice for $4 (a large slice though) The last image of the night was not soo nice though as a young lady was ON THE FLOOR being dry humped. God knows what was on that floor. All in all good night. My lady loved the night so I loved it even more.]
