[103300139028344618825,100528124838983436828,quaint tasting room. David & his wife are always a treat & make you feel like your visiting old friends. His flair for wine creation is amazing to me.. Ive NEVER found a better chocolate wine. Infact, I haven't tasted a bad wine from him. Even when he was testing out a new creation (he called project X) at the time.. & by all means go visit the sister winery maison de pagette.]
