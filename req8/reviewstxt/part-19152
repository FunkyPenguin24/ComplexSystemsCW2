[105079140716823204949,100013820180662758846,The Service Adviser was very friendly and helpful. I was able to get an appointment at the last minute without having to wait. The Service Technician called me personally to explain the situation with my repair and went out of his way to get the manager's approval for service, that was otherwise may not have been covered under warranty. I would have given Excellent Reviews had the original problem been fully resolved. I will have to go back at a later time to address the same issue; but I am sure I will be treated cordially again. It may take a few diagnostics to fully get the problem solved so I can't say they are at fault. Overall, I am happy with the service.]
