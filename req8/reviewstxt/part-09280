[100638929729145647631,100654504821845806026,The food is nasty and not fresh at all! Its not authentic chinese food, I can make better at home! The kitchen is really filthy i heard and the products they use are frozen junk. The prices are too high for the food as well. I heard the employees are treated horribly so lord knows what they do to the food. I also heard the owner is a real bitch and they are all american haters! Please take your business elsewhere!]
