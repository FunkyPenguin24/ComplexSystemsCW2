The programme offers amazing variation on the usual blockbuster business, I miss my films comps greatly. Everything is as it should be in the filmhouse. The business strives to succeed artistically and is balanced with a huge and very powerful social and environmental conscience, add to that delicious food lovingly prepared on-site and it is little wonder that the filmhouse is perennially busy and successful.]
