[105308379856493238762,100210486209057459054,My family and I have been customers since moving back here from asia in 2008. It is a family run shop and the service is always wonderful. We've had practically everything from the menu: japchae, bibimbap, dol sot bibimbap, bulgogi, dwaeji bulgogi (spicy pork bulgogi), jok galbi (ribs), dak galbi (spicy bbq chicken), yukgaejang (spicy beef soup), kimchi stew, and soondubuchigae (spicy soft tofu stew) to name a few. Without fail it is our "go to" restaurant here in the Couve.]
