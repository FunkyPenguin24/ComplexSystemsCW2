[117893141772456487542,100404221000145091499,Lobster bisque had a great flavor finished with sherry. Sea bass ravioli was delicate and creamy inside with a nice acidity to the creamy tomato sauce. A Grouper special topped with shrimp was moist, tasty and flaky. The thin sliced pineapple with ice cream was so refreshing. A special custard/flan with chunks of chocolate and caramel sauce was fluffy light and delicious. I really liked the caramelized provolone in the Tricolore salad and my dinner date raved over the spinach beet salad (she gave me most of the fried goat cheese = yumm!). I've eaten here twice (lunch and dinner) and the food is of the highest quality. The freshly made bread is so good, I deliberately held back so I would not fill up on bread! My date did not care for the pistachio sorbet but really liked the candied pistachios topping it (she wanted more nuts!). Seating in the back overlooks a quaint pond.]
