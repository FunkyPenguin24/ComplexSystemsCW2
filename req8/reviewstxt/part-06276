[104891866805437268634,100491108419740967942,Do not allow them to pull your credit under the promise that "it's just a soft pull and won't do anything to your credit". Within 48 hours my husband had 6 hard pulls on his credit and I had 4- all stemming from Morrie's. When we asked them about this, we were told that they would fall off of our credit score as soon as our loan (from our Credit Union- not even through them) was closed. They still haven't 3 weeks later. We were also sold a car that had mismatched license plates on it.]
