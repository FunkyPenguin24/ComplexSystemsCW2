This is the second vehicle we have bought from him as he always looks to fulfill our needs. The 2013 Civic I was looking at was a bit out of our range and he showed me a gem they had in the used car lot, a hardly used 2009 EX sedan that had only 13K miles and was more equipped than the new one and it was certified Pre-owned. Needless to say I now own such gem.]
