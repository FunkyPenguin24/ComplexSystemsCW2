[104133964089953844396,100086375578160187049,Mike and his guys have been working on our cars for almost 10 years. He has always given us great service and we love the free loaner car program. I just bought a new car and brought it in for a new vehicle inspection which gave me great peace of mind. He's just sad that my new car is so awesome that he won't be getting as much of my business. I would happily recommend Integrity Auto Repair to any of my friends and I will only have my new Subaru serviced by Mike and Brian and the Integrity Auto team. My kids love the free beverages and snacks in the waiting room too! Always a fair price too. -Alexa Hackett]
