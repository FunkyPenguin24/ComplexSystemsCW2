[104924698600063090920,100040231085565734460,Had carpet installed last summer and it went well except for the nails that are poking through the carpet. I understand why they are necessary but I feel the installation team should have pounded them down before they finished. I called customer service and was told I should do it myself. That's great. Pay for install, but finish it myself. Very disappointed in the service. Can't recommend as a vendor.]
