[107915301031403995020,100395262066533988725,I love pizza, and I have no beef with the establishment but this is the worst pizza I have ever had. Elios frozen pizza is better. The only thing I can say good about the food is that the salad was average. My daughter and I took home the pizza we did not eat so the family would beleive us when we told them how bad the pizza was.Their box says "A little slice of heaven" on it. That is the running joke in our family. Well I thank Mystic Pizza for that.]
