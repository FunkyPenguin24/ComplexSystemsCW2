[102887391802516085543,101157152670573353309,I can't tell you I had their food, but I am leaving a review because I never received the food I ordered. First they said they would be 15 minutes later than they initially stated. Then when that time had passed (by another 15 minutes) the delivery driver called and left a message stating he was lost and to call the main store and they will make me a new order since ours was cold. I should add that he was lost because you couldn't tell the difference between Way and Place. At this point we had waited 35-40 minutes AFTER the pizza was to arrive to I called and canceled the order and asked for my money back. The person taking the call was clearly confused by the entire issue and apologized several times. When I asked for my money back he said that he could have another order out in "maybe" 25 minutes, that would be when the food would be done. It would take another 15 to get to our home. After the first batch of issues I couldn't trust this at all. It was the restaurant that was at fault for being late, I assume the driver was flustered and just took a quick glance at the address which is why he was lost. Word of advice...don't order delivery from here. You may not end up getting it.]
