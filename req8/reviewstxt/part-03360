[115850239753366009165,100332797861609689566,I've been to various locations of Umami and this one by far was the worst with the service the waiter seem disinterested in being at work as a whole and didn't even acknowledge nor honor my student discount. Next time I will just call the manager to assist with these situations. All in all food is ok gets less and less "gourmet" the more you eat it. I call it my "once in a while place".]
