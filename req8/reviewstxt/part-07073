[101488933583465161130,100535796696103740623,Recently I bought a car at Serra kia and my sales person was Jimmy Dean and he was very nice and helpful to get me in a car i liked, any problems I had were all worked out and they work hard to keep the customer happy. All staff I came in contact with were very nice and everything was very clean. The cars are reasonably priced and I recommend Serra Kia if you are looking for a new or used car!]
