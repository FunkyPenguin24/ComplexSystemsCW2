[105826251272516008526,100925887694023174680,Our visit was on Friday evening. The bar area was very busy but a table became available. We asked if we could sit there but a waitress informed us that a group from the bar was waiting for a table. We then proceeded to the restaurant area. My husband went to use the restroom and noticed that the waitress gave the table to a group that had just entered the premises. We ordered drinks and a appetizer and three dinners. The waitress asked us how our dinner was a we told her that my daughter did not like the Talapia. My husband tasted it also and it had a bad taste.(thawed out to long) My husband is in the Hotel Restaurant Business. The waitress did not even ask what the problem was, she only said ok and walked away. Unfortunately my daughter in all did not have a meal. I believe there should have been some sort of compensation. We just recently moved to Allendale from the West Coast and wanted to try out a restaurant in our area, especially a family owned restaurant that has been here for so many years. The parking lot was full of cars which is generally a good indication in itself. I would really like to come back to the restaurant and feel like this could be my neighborhood bar and grill.]
