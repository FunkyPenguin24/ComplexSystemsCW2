[114113741425708292239,100240666061299990795,I cannot tell the full story of what Jordan Harris, assistant Manager at this location did for us, as it would likely put them out of business if people knew about it. So, I will simply say that I almost walked out the door due to a policy that they had that put him in a position that he could not give me what I wanted. So, rather than letting me go out the door, he bent over backwards and helped me to be happy. I cannot recommend the customer service of this location and Jordan enough!!! I am literally still in shock over what he did to take care of an almost upset client. Got our tires on in under an hour and were out the door happier then we could have ever been!! Cuddos to this store and their employees!! I am now a customer for life!!]
