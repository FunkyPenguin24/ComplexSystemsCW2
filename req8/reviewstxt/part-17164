[103998218087156485354,101085256049137875674,I can't believe it took so long for a place like this to open. You can get your fries or whole potato any way you want it with the serving style like Chipotle. Get as much greens as you want and pay a little extra from some "protein" a.k.a. poultry toppings like bacon! Food was super delicious.]
