[117259138927472074378,100833547293334694188,I order Chinese food often and never have a problem with me understanding them or them understanding me. However, the woman who took my order at Taste of China Hut on Decker Blvd could barely speak a full word of English, more like sounds. I said no broccoli twice, she thought I wanted double. When picking up the food, I was charged extra for the broccoli I didn't want. I then pointed out her mistake, which was met with huffs and puffs that she had to redo the order. Strike 1. I asked for extra sauce on my General's chicken. Due to the sauce being so thin and having way too much of it, it turned into a soup consisting of generals sauce, rice, a small bit of soggy chicken and a ton of cheap vegetables. Strike 2. The sauce itself tasted more like oil than anything else. I couldn't taste sweet or spicy as General's chicken is supposed to be. Strike 3. My recommendation is to skip this place. There are 4-5 other Chinese places within throwing distance that you can choose from that are less expensive, have food that tastes good and you get more of it. FYI - The lunch special was $6.25+tax for just chicken and rice. No drink or egg roll. Edit - I have to wonder about the previous reviewers of this restaurant. Half of them can't string a sentence together and the other ones don't say anything at all. I suspect the previous reviews for this restaurant are posted by the owners or people working there.]
