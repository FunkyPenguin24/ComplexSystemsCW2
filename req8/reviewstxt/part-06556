[101138366829149069453,100507757345664837393,Out of all the 24 Hour Fitness gyms I have visited, I love North Hollywood the most. It's very roomy, and you don't feel claustrophobic. The equipment is spread out, it doesn't smell like sweat when you walk through the door, it's very clean and the staff are friendly. I live in Eagle Rock, and I drive to North Hollywood to work out. Lastly, I love their Aqua Zumba and Aqua Aerobic classes. They are awesome. Like I said before, I love this gym!]
