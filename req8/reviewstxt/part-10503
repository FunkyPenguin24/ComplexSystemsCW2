[116809029078183666814,100720746017459334075,Get your head rubbed by a hipster! OMG I went in here by mistake. I haded got my hair cut in 6 months. My hair was curling over my ears and starting to look like a mullet in the back. I specifically told the barber that I didn't want to lose the length but wanted the mullet gone. The barber immedatly took out the shears and buzzed by hair off with no gaurd; nearly to the skin. I could have got my hair buzzed off for half the price else where but I thought these people could think outside the box. I got some jarhead hair cut and had to go back the next day because there were long spots missed in the back.]
