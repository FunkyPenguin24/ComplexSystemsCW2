[105327766275572347083,101079611648783977690,I loved every year at constitution highschool. I was able to meet some very interesting people there. The environment was one where I could feek free to show case my talent as a Poet/Rapper. All the Teachers who were there when I went were great, I'm pretty sure the new ones they have are just as good. The school isn't big at all so it was easy to get around.overall constitution is a great school I'm glad to have gone there.]
