[104526912261851878802,100130572399188780415,I am in Korea. I sent flowers to my mom for her birthday. It was definitely last minute, but they somehow managed to do it. Unfortunately they got there when she wasn't there, but they went between the times I asked. She had just stepped out. She loved them, and sent me a picture. I will keep doing flower deliveries with them!]
