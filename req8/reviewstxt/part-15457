[101799810887486291666,100990873082260846466,I've stayed in Jensen's On the Gulf several times in '12 and '13, and have enjoyed each experience. The 3-story bldg on the gulf provides superb views from the top floors, and is literally 50 steps from the water. There is simply nothing like experiencing the sunset from your own porch. At the same time a short walk brings you to the Jensen's Twin Palm marina on the Pine Isle Sound side of Captiva where you can rent a boat for fishing or sightseeing. For dining, the northern tip of Sanibel hosts two of the best places: the Mad Hatter for upscale cuisine and the Lazy Flamingo for the best, freshest fish in a bar-tavern atmosphere. Captiva is a great island, and I cannot recommend Jensen's too highly!]
