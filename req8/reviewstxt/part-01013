[102217263953595536769,100211521860808310907,I went about a month ago to have a burger and a beer for lunch. The pricing was reasonable (not cheap, but definitely got my money's worth), and the burger was delicious. I was the only one in the restaurant and felt very well taken care of as my server was frequently checking in. I also had a nice beer - a brown ale that they had on tap. I would definitely recommend this restaurant.]
