[110551237376373894823,100211088928063196581,I was told by a close friend of mine to visit State 8. This is where he had purchased his motorcycle and said that the service and value was unbeatable. I was in the market for a starter Sport-bike. After arriving to State 8 I was not rushed with salesmen hassling me or trying to make a quick sale, instead I was approached by a great man named Shawn H. roughly 5-10 minutes after browsing through. He asked me what I was looking for and after sitting on and talking about several bikes, I sat down to sign the paperwork for a new 2013 Honda CBR 500R. Overall 5 stars and great service. Honestly unbeatable. I would highly highly recommend this to anyone reading this or thinking to stop on in.]
