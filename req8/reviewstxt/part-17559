[104907368682743790254,101106333775686661326,We visited on our way to Indian Rocks Beach and had a party of 12. The staff was outstanding and very friendly. Food was outstanding and everyone in our party loved. We had the spicy crab rolls and they were to die for. The place was spotless and very informative on the area. Will definitely visit again.]
