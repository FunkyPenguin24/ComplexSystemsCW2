[101375773750895608059,101107277364549039465,I wish I had found this place a few years ago. I had been going to a place on the other side of town, as it was the only repair shop I knew that had a good reputation. I was looking on craigslist the other day to find a used laptop to use as a backup, and I decided to Google some local shops to see what was available there before I purchased anything. As it turned out, Computer Hut had exactly what I was looking for at a price that was comparable to, and even better than, some of the prices being asked by private sellers for similar laptops. And the laptop from Computer Hut has been nicely refurbished, looks and works great, and comes with a warranty. The best part (for me) is that they are a 5 minute walk from my house, so I have a feeling I will be bringing my other computers there for repairs/upgrades/etc. In addition to the quality of their merchandise, the customer service was outstanding. Given a choice between two similar businesses, I will always choose the one with better customer service. Even though I was not there to spend a lot of money, the young lady who assisted me took the time to consider what I needed, and found the perfect solution to meet those needs. She also took the time to go through a number of issues related to technical matters, thereby providing even greater assurance that the computer I wanted to buy was exactly what I needed. I am glad that I took the few extra minutes to do some research yesterday, and found this place. I will definitely be a return customer.]
