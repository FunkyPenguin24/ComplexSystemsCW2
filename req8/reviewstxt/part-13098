[107600434360258738683,100862794744413994929,This is the first time we have every had a pest control service come out to our house. We live in the Henderson area and have a lot of those lovely scorpions. I called Bulwark because of that big scorpion on the trucks. That really got my attention. Bulwark sent a tech by the name of Sione T to our house for the first service. He did a really good job on spraying our whole yard and in the garage. He also came in the house and did some stuff. By the time Sione was done spraying our backyard, we already started seeing the bugs dying. What a good site that is... Sione was very friendly and took care of any request we had. Thanks Sione for the great work that was completed today at our house. We really do appreciate it.]
