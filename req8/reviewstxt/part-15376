[107234891276301382999,100986358235583454446,THe customer SERVICE is the major part of the Service industry and this Restaurant, and BAR has no Idea of CUSTOMER SERVICE!! instead its so bad that they must be sued for this, A Birthday party with friends and family and we were not met with a Waiting staff till 30 mins (this is when there were only 4-5 tables occupied) then the order came in late (very late). The table next to us were loud mouths, and were noisy and it was getting on the nerve so we politely told the head waitress about it, She rather than managing it properly, asks us to move some where calmer! and that even when we were the ones to raise the issue. Such was the appalling service that the head waitress when asked about a family table says , Sit anywhere you like. Utterly impolite and rude behaviour on her part, which is understandable as she is the staff not the business owner. But the business owner were also not good enough to contain the situation and win customers instead he was trying to suggest us that the kitchen closes at 9:30 pm and kindly give u r orders, which was equally funny as was the head waitress. SADLY in this industry, U need to win customers, below par food, below par service and below par behaviour is the HALLMARK of this place, if you want to have a good quite and peaceful time with friends and family this is not the place !! PS: Blue ginger is nearby and is a amiable service I wish if there were a half star rating i can give this place]
