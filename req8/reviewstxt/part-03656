[108677949987988904373,100349710601084833951,Dr. Slaughter is fantastic. She helped my husband and I with arranging for Lasik at Eye Lasik Austin and is providing the follow-up care after surgery. The entire experience has been outstanding. The doctor and her staff are very friendly and attentive to our needs, answering our many questions and, yes, they do remember us and previous conversations we have had, which is very refreshing. They get to know their patients on a little more of a personal level, not just as a file they pull for annual visits. Lakeline Vision has email and text reminders that patients can sign up for which is very helpful when are all very busy and have full schedules. I really appreciate the extra steps this practice takes to ensure their patients feel comfortable with their care and we that we receive a very high level of attention.]
