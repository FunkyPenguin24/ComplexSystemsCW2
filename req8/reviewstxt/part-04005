[102297697969717479665,100369712820904755134,I found the employees to be sullen and not very helpful. I went in with barely used Parasuco/555Soul/Guess/TNA clothing and they didn't buy a single thing saying they weren't what they were looking for.....yet there were well-worn cheap clothing on the racks from Old Navy/Walmart! I'm going to sell my clothes on my own online instead - so much easier and saves you the rudeness]
