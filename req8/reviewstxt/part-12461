My problem was my Galaxy S3 screen went out. I called first to ask a question about my phone, the lady that answered was polite and helpful. She did not know the answer to my question but asked me to please call back when their tech ariived. She told me his name and when he arrived. I called back, spoke with the tech who was also polite and helpful. He said that they do $10 diagnosis in house and it only takes 45-60 minutes. I brought the phone in at noon that day. I called back probably around 2pm. They told me that the screen was bad but they had replacements if i chose to go that route. They quoted a price and because i had already researched the price of my screen I knew their quote was spot on. Labor was nothing...and they have a 10% coupon on their site. The entire staff was helpful, polite and timely. My phone was fixed that day as promised. I even have the numbe for the tech just incase something happens again. Thanks so much to everyone at the store!!!!!!!!]
