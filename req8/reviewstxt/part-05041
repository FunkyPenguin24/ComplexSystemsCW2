[104576328142311550185,100425869881382725609,I've been coming here since mid-late 80's. Food is always excellent. I have to say though, went there this morning, and they evidently have some sort of sewage issue. It was very overpowering, and ultimately ended up leaving. Reminiscent of a port-a-potty in the sun, mid August. Hope they get this resolved!]
