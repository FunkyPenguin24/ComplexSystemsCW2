[100333274479396388234,100158193219397425849,This was our first time at any Johnny Rocco's. In general it was a pleasant experience. The restaurant was very clean, nice environment, the food was very good and the service was very good as well. We went there for lunch and we had great time. We would recommend this location to a friend no problem. My wife ordered a New York (steak) and I ordered something called Nonna's meatballs (not sure about the name but it was kind of a sandwich) with Parmesan potatoes. I would give 5 stars to the stake and 4 stars to the meatballs. The service was fast and we were in and out in about an hour.]
