[109460564966830572577,100760707382650421791,I asked why I received no mail yesterday and no delivery until after 5 today and was told "some people don't get mail every day". I said that hasn't happened at my house address since 1988 when I moved in. I asked when I could talk to somebody with more answers and was told to call back on Monday. I asked who I should talk to and was told "to the manager" but he's not there on Monday. No wonder these people lose money every year. Complete morons.]
