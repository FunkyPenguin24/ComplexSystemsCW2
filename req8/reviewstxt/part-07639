[111220753797312740960,100567563543007463965,I grew up going to Chautauqua and while I can only afford to go one week of every year I make the best effort possible to give my family the same experiences I had growing up with such a place as Chautauqua in my life. I agree with the financial problems of other viewers as well as the attitude problems mentioned but I believe that to be the state of our society as a whole, unfortunately. Where ever you go on this planet you will encounter people with more: more money, more power, more something and unfortunately, some of those people have not been taught how to be courteous and seem not to have a thought of general well being toward others. I thank those in charge of maintaining the Chautauqua Institution for keeping it going and for doing their best to honor the original founding fathers intent. Thank you!]
