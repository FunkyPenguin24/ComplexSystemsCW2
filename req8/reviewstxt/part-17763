[113369378135029765035,101118109977279012490,My husband, 1 and a half year old son and I stayed here for about 2 weeks while we waited for our house to be ready. To be honest, I could have lived here forever. Haha. The staff was amazing and understanding. There were a couple of problems with our room. (We had 2 bedroom suite), the front door was broken, and one of the bathroom doors lock was broken. Both were fixed promptly. My son was sick for about a week, and we were using the "playpens" they provided for his sleeping arrangement. He vomited in one, they replaced it then shortly after he did it again in the new one! I felt so terrible, but they were more than understanding. I offered to pay for them but they refused the offer. The breakfast was more than enough, much better than you will find at most hotels (we have stayed in MANY, as we travel a lot!). If I had a reason to go back, I would. I have recommended Homewood Suites to friends and family when they are in town.]
