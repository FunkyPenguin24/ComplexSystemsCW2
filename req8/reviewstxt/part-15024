[101519923950562376396,100968172431129057351,Seating wasn't a problem in the restaurant, because nobody was dining there on a Sunday night. The prices of their specials will bring you in, but the dinner entrées that you will want are double the price. I agree with others that it took awhile to get drinks, let alone a refill. I will admit that my dinner was good, but my fiancé's meal was bland. All in all, an okay first impression.]
