[107589964088087039746,100190068258882061694,I don't usually write reviews but I felt that this company deserved one. My 2010 Acura MDX had major damage and as soon as the car was towed to 427 i felt like I was in good hands. The service rep called me to see if I was ok and to let me know the car had arrived to the shop and kept me in the loop the entire time. When I called my insurance company they asked me which shop was doing the work and when I told them it was 427 they said they told me that they were one of the highest rated shops and that their work was of highest quality out there. When I went to see the car I got to see the shop and was blown away as to how clean and immaculate the place was. I am in sales and deal with people and companies every day and the service and work I received from this company was awesome. I had a great experience and would highly recommend 427 Auto Collision to anyone!]
