[102775905749732561288,100965376098566068979,This is not about a particular visit. It is about the general management of this location. I frequent a lot of McDonald's. I've been to McDonald's in more states than I'd like to admit and also to locations in other countries. This particular location is not a very busy one. Actually, it is on the slow side. I happen to live down the road and therefore frequent it a lot. On average at least once a day. Orders are wrong more often than not. Delays happen at all times of the day and night. Having to wait unusually long periods of time in the drive-thru is the rule instead of the exception. At times when I have gone inside I see more employees than customers and they still seem to take forever to fill an order and when filled chances are pretty good that it is wrong. The first few times this happened I just chalked it up to chance but I now realize that this is an every day occurrence. The one thing I can always count on with McDonald's is consistency in service and products wherever I stop. Please review this location and find out why they don't meet McDonald's standards.]
