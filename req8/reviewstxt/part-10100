[104357071532108381000,100699220944921591311,Jackie did a great job on my facial. I bought a Groupon and had no problems. I did buy the 2 facial package. Booked my appointment with ease, nice reception area, welcoming, warm, lots of space, not on top or near others, in a private room, nice background music, smelled good, very polite. My first time visiting and look forward to my next appointment. Face feels and looks great. I totally recommend it. I just moved here from Canada, so I was pleasantly surprised at my finding a great spa on my first visit! Liked: Service, Atmosphere, Value]
