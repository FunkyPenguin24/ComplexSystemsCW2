[112231485155857133901,100303083874674076670,This is by far my favorite far east restaurant in this area. The food is excellent in every way, the presentation is very nice. The atmosphere is almost like visiting a friend in their home for dinner. The owner/ operator is a very beautiful and gracious lady who takes her quests as serious friends she has known for years and invited to spend a little time with her and her family for dinner. I only take my close family and very best friends there because I know they will enjoy their meal and the beautiful atmosphere. A perfect place be alone with people you enjoy being around.]
