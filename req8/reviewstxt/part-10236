[102901325352858368915,100706838126139074826,Living Springs Veterinary Care has been such a valuable asset for our family. Our dogs are a big part of our family and our Dog Training Business. Living Springs has helped us through everything from the birth of our puppies to the sorrow of losing one of our beloved dogs. Their commitment to their clients and of course the many varieties of animals that are in their care. I highly recommend Living Springs Veterinary Care to anyone with veterinary needs. Their courteous and knowledgable staff will take good care of you and your pets. Leah Morse CPDT-KA Certified Professional Dog Trainer/ Canine Behavior Therapist]
