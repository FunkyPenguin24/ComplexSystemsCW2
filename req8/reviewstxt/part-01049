[106814568665077071376,100213394480674510052,I put off dental care for a few years due to not having insurance. I found Affordable Dental Care to be just that. Affordable. The staff is great and the doctor is awesome. All around great experience. I recommended them to my friends and even received a credit for my next visit due to a friend getting a root canal and crown. Thanks guys. See you soon for my next cleaning.]
