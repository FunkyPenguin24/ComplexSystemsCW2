[109313957214054656952,100600847434718991990,Serviced our Mercedes sprinter van 3 times now. Still going back for more. They supplied us a nice loaner car for the time our vehicle was in service. I have had 2 negative experiences however. 1 was a giant scratch and dent I had to point out to them. ( kinda hard to believe they did not inform me about it. ) 2nd was 2 front grill bolts were completely left loose which i noticed upon pickup. They started the threads by hand and never finished tightening. 1 more negative experience will send me elsewhere. Stay tuned. 12/7/12. Im headed back today to get a brake service.]
