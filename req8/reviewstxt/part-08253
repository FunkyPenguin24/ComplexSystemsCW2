It was overpriced - $18 for 4 breakfast burritos. The drive through took long enough that we regretted not going to a sit down place. The potatoes weren't all thoroughly cooked, even those that were were crazy-bland, like just boiled or something. I had no idea breakfast burritos could be so flavorless! We didn't order meat, but still, we get these from various sources who can make a good burrito without it. There is no sauce included inside at all, it's an extra charge for chili and it didn't seem like there was a bit of chili in any of them, after paying. We will never go back. There wasn't even any cheese! We're pretty easy to please when it comes to burritos, but I can't say how surprised I am these guys are still open. Sadly, the gas station variety is a better value.]
