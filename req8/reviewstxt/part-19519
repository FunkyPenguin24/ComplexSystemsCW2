[104390144496915963057,100033782971466225469,If you happen to be a woman in your mid-20s or anyone who is not very knowledgeable about cars. DO NOT visit this place without someone who does. I feel very taken advantage of. You, of course, get the feeling you may not need all the services suggested, but trust me, you won't be able to turn down services without being made feel like an idiot. There's no reason a 'car expert' can't give honest answers about what needs fixed right now and what may be able to wait... Shame.]
