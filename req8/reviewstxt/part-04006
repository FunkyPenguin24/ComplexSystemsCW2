The owner is very friendly and well meaning, but seems to fail to realize that his patrons expect faster service. I mean we had to wait a LONG time, putting us in a difficult situation with our gracious babysitter. Bottom line: take your wife, have a good time, IF you don't mind waiting a long time for your food and drinks. The place is excellent if you don't mind hanging out for a long time. Enjoy the live music while you wait, it's pretty good. And I also echo those who said try the flaming cheese.]
