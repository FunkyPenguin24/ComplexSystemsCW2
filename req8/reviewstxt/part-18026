[108093241465193565020,101130944403200069099,Dogtopia is a wonderful place to take your dog to. My dog has issues with riding in cars (she hates it), but she knows when we are on our way to Dogtopia and is very good in the car, and in fact, when we get in the front door she makes an all out sprint to the door. She has so much fun and is tired when she comes home. She often falls asleep on the way home. They also are great for boarding. They take the information and follow it and let you know how your pet is doing if you e-mail, facebook, or call and ask. Take your dog here, you will not regret it.]
