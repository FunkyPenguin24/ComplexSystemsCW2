[100000361416525577790,100852553003843098980,We were so excited to have a Thai restaurant in the neighborhood and then it turns out the food is really really good and the prices and portions are quite reasonable. We've done take out three times and every time it was fantastic. We've tried several other Thai restaurants around town and this is hands-down our favorite. Glad it is so close too.]
