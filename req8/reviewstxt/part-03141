[116734314267156534047,100321596136205159877,Always use drive-thru and don't believe I have ever had a mixed up order. Everyone always greets okay too. My compliant is the grilled sandwiches (breakfast). More often than not my breakfast sandwich is just bread with butter on it and the cheese is never melted. It would be nice to have that bread toasted as the picture shows on the menu board and cheese melted. Other than that, no complaints.]
