[112010032811371007997,100960775543501823251,I enrolled at Brazillian Top Team in Signal Hill, Ca in August 2013, to basically further my strength training for surfing and increase my cardio. A friend of mine that had been training Jiu Jitsu for around ten years suggested I try it. Amazing is all I can say. Lost 16 lbs in the first three months training 2 to 3 times a week. Not that I needed to lose weight but as my core strengthened and muscles tone, everywhere, it just came off. The most supportive and health conscious group of guys I've come across. These guys have turned out to be the most inclusive and respectful group that I could of imagined. Thank you Professor Perdomo for welcoming me into your academy. ooooss!]
