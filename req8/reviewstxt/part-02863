[100331916991476141087,100306576586224703392,The Thunder Bay Museum is a great museum. Wheelchair accessibility is pretty good with a ramp up to the front door and elevator inside to access the the other floors. My impressions with the museum is that, for a small city, it is a modest museum with a decent collection sure to be of interest to children and adults. They do have a small gift shop that is worth checking out as well.]
