[100230261173543701692,100517498849759971676,95% of my theater going experiences were from here. I remember watching the Lion King and Star Wars Episode 1 most before. Lord of the Rings Trilogy was my inspiration into films and alongside it I went to the theater more frequently. The Local Advertisements - I remembered for so many years they played the "Gladiator" soundtrack in the theater. With nothing but black screen I would slip into my wildest imaginations and had the most epic orchestrations to back it up before I became a film soundtrack enthusiast.But that's now gone and we get ads these days from local businesses. At first they were terrible for stealing my attention and evaporating all the anticipation of waiting in a quite theater(aided with soundtrack) but over time the ads got much better and I have accepted that they'll likely never return to that mysticism treatment nowadays in this Information Age. Prices - They swing at times depending on the season. Right now they are a bit pricy I must admit. Best bargain is the combo with a free refill, but at the expense of having to walk out of the movie for 1-2 minutes. Digital Projectors - Since the upgrade I have no major gripes so far. The image is cleaner and hasn't lost it's cinematic feel.]
