[107568089228915742678,100200616882165797142,Sure, the view is scenic... but that's all that's really good to say about this place. I received some of the worst service I've ever experienced at any restaurant. The fish I was served was still frozen in the middle. Seriously? You're located a stone's throw from the Atlantic Ocean and you can't sell fresh seafood? The staff doesn't seem like they want to even be there and our waitress literally complained in front of us when our party asked for separate checks. So this establishment is basically fast-food quality and service demanding a gourmet price. I do NOT recommend eating here!]
