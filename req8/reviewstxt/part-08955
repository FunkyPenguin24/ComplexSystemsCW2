[101562156863190779711,100635780474168627952,We were walking down the street from our hotel and walked up on this Thai restaurant. The prices were good and a great aroma was coming out of the restaurant. The food was just heavenly and tasted awesome. There was so much on the menu to choose from, but I started with sushi, crab wontons and shrimp coconut soup then had Red Curry Chicken and Thai fried. I'd recommend this place with 4 stars and will dine there again before I leave.]
