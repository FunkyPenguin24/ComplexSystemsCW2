[115349971556989722841,100799307060984010856,From the minute I arrived, Chris and Shannon were great. Chris was very understanding of my needs and helped me get the deal I wanted. Chris' people skills were untouchable! The entire experience was a great one to remember. I have plans to use Bulldog Kia for all my future car needs. Chris is a huge asset to the Bulldog kia team and I wish him the best success. Thank you so much, Chris! The finance guy that handled my purchase also deserves a shout-out. Steve Carter is the man to go see at Bulldog kia, I've never met such a great finance guy, ever! Chris and Steve went far and beyond the call of duty and I can not say thank you enough! You guys ROCK!!!]
