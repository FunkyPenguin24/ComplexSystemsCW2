[109605060978924695428,100150840761223167013,Me and my dad were going to buy a bunny from this pet retailer. This isn't the best store in town. It was neat so it didn't look or smell like a dirty farm. When we picked out my bunny it was fine but when the worker suggested the cage, I was terrified. The cage she pick out for my medium sized bunny was an extra-large Super Pet® cage. They had the 2 floor cages, but she didn't even look at those. Then we bought her supplies. When we bought the hut for them to sleep in she suggested the Ecotrition® 8-in-1 hut, which I happily bought. And we also bought beding, food, hay, and everything else a bunny needs. Except toys, treats, and things to chew on because she said the Ecotrition® hut will "Take care of it all at a small price." When we bought everything at the cashier's desk it was a total of a whopping $250 even though we only bought 10 things!!! When we got home, I set everything up nice and pretty and watched my new pet in her new palace. The next day, me and my dad looked at my bunny struggling to fit into her hut. The worker said "It will fit her just fine" but it didn't even fit her head! We decided we will but another one in a couple days. The day after that, I was lifting the hut by pieces of cardboard, thinking it was a good idea. It was but my bunny kept eating the cvardboard. But never knd that, when I was setting it up on the cardboard, I was 6 or 7 COCKROACHES!!!!! Then there was a 2 big ones inside her food! I will never shop here again.]
