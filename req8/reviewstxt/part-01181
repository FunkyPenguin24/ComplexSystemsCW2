[114344423107061716857,100220393731659188188,I've been really impressed with Ripplenet not only as a Web Design company but also with their friendly staff and supportive customer service. I also like that after our website was initially designed and set up, we were taught how to add pages and posts to it ourselves (though it's certainly a work in progress on my part!). I really feel like Ripplenet cares about us as people and not just as a customer and I know that should anything go wrong, I can trust Ripplenet to resolve the problem quickly and efficiently with no messing about.]
