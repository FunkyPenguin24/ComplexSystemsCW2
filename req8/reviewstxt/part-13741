[104709515638007049610,100898048982251739417,I am a Marriott Rewards Gold member and booked a reservation for this hotel from my mobile app. I did not notice that the rate was a pre-paid non refundable rate. When my travel plans changed at the last minute I called the hotel to change the reservation and that is when I was informed it was a pre-paid non refundable room. The very nice girl that took my room change information told me to call the accounting department of the hotel and they could work with me to refund the fee. I placed 3 calls to the accounting department, all of which went to voicemail. None of the 3 calls were returned. I then called the hotel and asked to speak to a manager and again, was told they would take my name and number and have someone return my call. Guess what, no return call. I travel to NJ twice a month. On one visit I stay at the Courtyard property in Jersey City and for the 2nd visit I had been staying at the Hilton Iselin. Due to my Gold status, I thought I would give the Renaissance a try. Based on this experience, it is back to Hilton for me.]
