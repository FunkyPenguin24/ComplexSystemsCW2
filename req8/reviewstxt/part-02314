[100095818543242356648,100278397043047617609,Contracted to replace a few double glazed windows and a porch for my mother - only one man on the job at any one time it seems over 3 weeks later it's still going on - one window broken before installation, porch still not completed and two bay windows still to fit. So much for being professional ! Then to top it all mum slipped on a dust sheet left by the worker and broke her ankle - hell will freeze before I personally use this firm, just waiting for them to finish mums' work and then good ridence to them.]
