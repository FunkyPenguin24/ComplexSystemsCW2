[104562318299717040642,100399329705139069382,This was the WORST hotel experience I have ever had. The bathroom was filthy. The air conditioning system was awful. I got sick. No internet. No one answers the phone. Richard the owner is crazy! I mean, how is he in the hopsitality business. Do not go there, I repeat, DO NOT GO THERE. Smoke alarm went off alllll night and he did nothing. He lies. You will not sleep or get rest. The worst place I have ever been.]
