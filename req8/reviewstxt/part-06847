[108457743536367342281,100524513279396851013,Sierra Vista Review from Jay Kemmer: Jay had his mother and brother in our community at the same time for a period of two years. Both passed away within two months of each other. Jay stated that Sierra Vista would call at the drop of a hat and he always knew what was going on with them. Jay felt that the people at Sierra Vista were, "Always positive", "Compassionate", and "Gave lots of love to both of them". The Kemmer's were dearly loved at Sierra Vista and they will be greatly missed by residents and staff alike.]
