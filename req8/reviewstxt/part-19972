[113339539113822729514,100058368568361703637,I booked it from Expedia (~$170 for 3 days). Then when I came to the counter after a long flight, the guy told me a lot of things in a very low voice (now I realize that's a trick). First, the damage waiver is NOT insurance, but they would never tell you this but only put it in a manual in a very samll fontsize, and give you that manual AFTER you sign everything. I had thought that this was the insurance i paid via Expedia, but it's not!! ~$30 a day for that bullshit!! Second, refuel by yourself, never choose their fuel option. They charged you for the whole tank at the beginning: if you don't use it up, they don't refund for the remaining gas; if you use it up and refill, what's left is theirs and they don't refund. So at the end I found they charged me ~$200 (separate from the $170 charged by the Expedia). Again, the guy spoke in such a low voice, with the purpose of not alarming you of any surcharges, and never meant to explain to you anything clearly, but just wanted to charge you more when your mind is not clear.. FXXK!!!]
