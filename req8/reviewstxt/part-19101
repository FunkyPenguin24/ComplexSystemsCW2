[113876081549347519749,100011040576306798465,After being pushed around by Ancira, and told I couldn't get the car I wanted, I decided to give IPAC a call. I was greeted by Larry, one of the most friendly, reasonable salesmen I've ever dealt with. He was very professional and listened to my concerns and understood what I was looking for and what I wanted to spend. He knew that the information I gave him was solid and what I could and could not afford. He did not push anything on me just showed me what I was interested in. Larry did not act as a car salesman, but a consumer and helped me find what I wanted, and I walked out of the dealership with a 2011 Dodge Charger, EXACTLY what I wanted. HE EVEN DROVE WITH ME to the dealership that had my trade-in to MAKE SURE they didn't try to pull something over on me and made sure they gave me the keys to my old car. This really went above and beyond his spirit to serve me, and it was good knowing I had someone who had my back the whole time. I will be back to see Larry, and I will recommend anyone who is looking to buy a car to go see him. He is honest,upfront, and was a pleasure to deal with.]
