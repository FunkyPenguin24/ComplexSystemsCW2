[100062731394568763123,101022406851792908711,Great place for a hamburger. Fries are phenomenal. Service is spectacular. There's a little black lady there, sorry don't know her name, that does a fantastic job of making you feel welcome and appreciated. If you're eating there, she'll have you tell her your number so that she can bring you your food. Great place.]
