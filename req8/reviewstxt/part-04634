[103195323009591136298,100406244494131926799,My family used to go here all the time because my cousin worked behind the counter and would give us free pizzas. After he quit, we stopped going there. Why? Well, their pizza really sucks. I don't know why everyone thinks this place is so good. Their pizzas are either overcooked or undercooked. Rarely, is it cooked properly. Once, I had a burned slice that I swore came out of the freezer.]
