[100737919368649719751,100697897127491319760,I recently had a very good experience in the Cedar Park ER. I had some bad reactions to some antibiotics I was prescribed and was really scared. The front desk staff was really friendly, the nurse was great and the ER doctor took care of things right away and I was in and out in a couple of hours. I was seen to with in ten minutes of walking in the door, and the nurse who was leaving her shift came in to check on me before she went home, and introduced me to the nurse that was taking over. I liked how it was very clean, didn't have a strange smell and has all brand new equiptment. I'd go back for sure!]
