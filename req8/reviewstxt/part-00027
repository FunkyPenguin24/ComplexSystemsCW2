[115484526140016293791,100160413783328130994,Well...if you want to get screwed, go to this shop. Loaner vehicle they sent me out in had 3 bald tires (I found out later) of which 1 went flat when I got home 50 miles away. No spare. No jack. They said go to a tire shop and they would pay for handling the situation. After $400 at Walmart for the cheapest 3 new tires they stocked (old ones were dangerous) A-1 refused to pay. I said take off my tires (I brought their old ones back). They wanted to charge me for doing that!! They replaced my AC but didn't install a new drier in the system which is mandatory for warranty on the compressor. They would not accept my certified letter of intent to sue. I decided it wasn't worth my time anyway. Anybody need 3 16" tires I'll never use? Only 100 miles on them. I'd buy a new truck before going back to those idiots.]
