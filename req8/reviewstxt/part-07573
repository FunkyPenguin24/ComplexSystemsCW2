[113825263902126968811,100564491739312331071,I love Monument Chevrolet. They are so thorough and so caring. I have driven a Chevrolet from these people for over 30 years. I would go no where else. The service department now calls when my vehicle is in for maintenance and will send me photos online to show me the progress. The repair facility is top notch. When the chips are down, I want Monument in my corner.]
