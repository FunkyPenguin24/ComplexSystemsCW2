[112980413937853270665,100749397302569626695,Crepes is always a good, safe, affordable option to eat at in Bogot√°. I try to have something different each time I go and I've never been disappointed. Lots of locations and consistency in the food and service. Nice, big salads and lots of vegetarian options. The ice cream and arequipe waffles are highly recommended.]
