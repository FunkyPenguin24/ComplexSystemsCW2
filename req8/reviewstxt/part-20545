[100272022809141508134,100087985877135006764,I switched over to Dr. T a couple of years ago and he is awesome. They are great about calling to make sure you get the appointments you need and usually have lots of different time options. The staff is great too. They are all very friendly and make a point to get to know you, going beyond the normal caregiver. I would definitely recommend them.]
