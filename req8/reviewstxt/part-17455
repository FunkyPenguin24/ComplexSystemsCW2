[103641347663007530302,101100836246629030295,I'm not sure if I hate this travel agency or all travel agencies. Ramon was nice on the phone- but never followed up. I had to call HIM back in order to ensure he actually booked my flight and get updates on price changes. Now that I think about it- hes yet to call me back...ever. I'm not sure what the customer service mantra is here, but regardless of language quality business practices are the same worldwide. If I want to know something, let me know that day. And if you can't tell me, let me know when you'll have an answer. If you drag your feet don't expect me to pay the price- you'll pay it in lost business- that's a guarantee. UPDATE- 1 year later. I was recently contacted by a rep hoping to 'change my mind' about this company by offering a discounted price due to my poor review. Since this contact, new reviews have been created (I'm looking at you Mike Anderson). Maybe there was a management change recently and they are looking to create a new positive image. They may actually be providing some better service a year later. Too little too late for my $. Welcome to the 21st century Forest Travel.]
