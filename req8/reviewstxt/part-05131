[107199985038526548462,100430129794260842281,My wife and I stayed here before moving into town several years ago, and now we stay there as a getaway. Their deluxe jacuzzi tub cottages are adorable, but even their standard rooms are amazing. Newly upgraded rooms with large flatscreen TV's, stylish decor, VERY friendly and accomodating staff, a super cute garden with nice outdoor furniture (even has overhead outdoor fans for the hot summers). Very nice, new and clean linens. And do NOT skip breakfast. They treat you to a nice spread of cold pastries, fruits, yogurts, etc - and then let you order from a menu (eggs made to order, french toast to die for, etc).]
