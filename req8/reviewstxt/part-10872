[106693576246230476442,100740695986425260546,I had Master Roofing put a new roof on my house. I had a leak in a valley and some rotten sheathing and rafter tails. They came out August 2012 to do the work. Mikes crew, led by Ed, did a GREAT JOB! They cleaned up every day they where here. They removed two layers of old shingle and sourced the leak to an improperly built chimney. They rebuilt the chimney properly with correct paper and flashing. They replaced the eave sheathing and trimmed back the rafter tails. They also installed 2 new vents over the garage. Ed's skill and knowledge was on full display as he directed his crew in the installation of a beautifully straight, black, three tab shingle roof. The craftsmanship was SUPERB. Mike gave me an estimate that included QUALITY materials, at a FAIR price. Things like 30lb felt instead of 15lb, and vents that are metal not plastic. The best part.....less than $500 above the estimate. That included the extra work on my chimney. I highly recommend MASTER ROOFING. I felt good about the entire process and saw with my own eyes the quality of work done on my house. I'm very pleased with their work. John Middleton]
