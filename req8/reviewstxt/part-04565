[102063350015398132192,100402400041083819463,My kids loved this place! The staff was friendly and answered all our questions. We started with a tour but it was too long the kids. The staff had no problem with us breaking away from the group and going on our own. The trains were awesome, the short film good and there were Thomas toys to play with upstairs. A nice family friendly museum with some cool history.]
