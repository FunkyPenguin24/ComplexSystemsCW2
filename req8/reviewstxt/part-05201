They sent it back with a bunch of marks all over. I brought it in and asked for help. She said the lot I am sending it to is vaccent. (Uh no my sister lives there.) Next they said I could not send it in that envelope because it was all marked up. (UM you guys marked it up and crossed out the address. So I said can I use this stamp on the other package. She said no it has been use. (No you never sent it to the person, it wasn't even marked.) I went to Fedex, I was very happy they helped me out and sent it in one day no additional charge.]
