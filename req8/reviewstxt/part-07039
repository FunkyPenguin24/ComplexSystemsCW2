[113989344498881889719,100534253897047391232,I was extremely impressed by the service. Not only was our waitress prompt and polite, she kept a smile on her face the entire time and was funny. Also, a mark of good service is when waitstaff who aren't waiting on your table stop to check and see if there is anything they can do for you, which happened at least 3 times. My steak was perfect! Will definitely go again.]
