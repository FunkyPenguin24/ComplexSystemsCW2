[100523706531526410794,100657798853587257420,We recently used ASAP Movers for a long distance move from the Central Coast to Northern California. I have to say that we were very happy with the service we received. We got several quotes from different local companies, all of them were out of our budget. After looking over different moving company websites we decided that the service provided by ASAP Movers seemed to be as good as any of the others. Kasey Fox came to our home to give us an accurate estimate based on the amount of stuff we had. I felt that he was very personable and professional, getting as much information as possible about our needs. The quote he gave us not only fit our budget but included the same services other companies provided. The morning of our move the crew arrived on-time and immediately got to loading the truck. The guys worked very diligently and efficiently. Within 4 hours they had packed up everything from our house and garage. They even provided wardrobe boxes for our hanging clothes in the closets and big crates for our TV and framed artwork. The 2 guys were very nice and really seemed to care about handling our belongings with care, especially the boxes we marked FRAGILE. The following morning, the truck arrived at our new home a few minutes earlier than expected, which was great! Again, the crew worked fast and had all of our furniture and boxes unloaded and set up in our new house after just 2 hours. Overall if you are considering a move to or from the Central Coast I definitely recommend using ASAP Movers.]
