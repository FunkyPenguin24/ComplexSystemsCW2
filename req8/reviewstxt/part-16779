[107664853531664812522,101062509296562215466,My mother and I are staying in St.Paul Minnesota for the weekend and we weren't too sure what to order. I mentioned having Chinese delivered and after comparing a few Google reviews on different Chinese food places we decided to give Chin Chin Chinese a try. There definitely wasn't a single regret about our decision. Mom ordered the Kung Pao chicken meal and it came with the kung pao chicken, 2 egg rolls, 4 crab ragoons, and chicken fried rice. I orded a small order of chicken lo-mein, an order of crab ragoons, and a small order of rice. Also provided two fortune cookies. :) The food was still hot when it got here, they were here on time..early even...and the service was very friendly. The food was a lot for such a great price and very good quality. We would definitely order from them again and would recommend this restaurant to family and friends.]
