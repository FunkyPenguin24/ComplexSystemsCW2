[101791134413610416628,100749049827552649636,Walking through the door I knew this was the right place to go. Kind, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff! Thorough testing done before and a nice meeting with the operating doctor. I had Dr. John Mauro, this guy is great really felt comfortable trusting him with my visions future. Surgery went quick and so was the recovery!! I was able to see the next day and go to work. Almost no irritation, just a little light sensitivity... nothing glasses or drops could fix. This is the place to go !!]
