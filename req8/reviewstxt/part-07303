Went back up there for the manager to get smart.. I called the D.M, she was very friendly and i felt she handler the matter well. I informed her that it will be in his best intrest to give me my money, or i will call Channel 2, 5, 11 and CNN... The cashier stated that she knew they was serving soda with debri in it...SMDH!!!!!Never again will i visit KFC ....]
