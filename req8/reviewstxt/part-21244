[109500091360971915206,100125346325851514440,We were leery about staying here based upon bed bug review. We called corporate and the hotel to ensure any pest infestation was cleared up. Hotel assured us all was well. We checked out room before we paid and found no evidence of any bed bugs. Were it not for Clarion Rewards, we would have skipped this place altogether. The night clerk could barely speak English and was very surly. The hall and elevator carpet was filthy. Beds were not comfortable. The breakfast was extremely subpar and we had to go beg the same surly clerk for syrup for the waffles. For the price paid, this hotel is nowhere near worth it. I would expect this type of accomodations from a $50 or less hotel. Everyone we spoke to in the morning around the so-called breakfast expressed the same displeasure with their stay.]
