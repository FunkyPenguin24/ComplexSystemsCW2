[104825976824925147235,100650708076855489754,I have been a customer off an on of Hubcap Heaven for well over 20 years, they have always been my "go to" place for any wheel related item I may have needed. My hobby is restoring older cars and sometimes I like to keep them as original as possible. They use to always carry nice used hubcaps for my vintage cars. I guess that has changed, I went by today to purchase some wire wheel center caps or a matching set of Lincoln hubcaps for my 1989 Lincoln Town Car, and the heavy set older man there was just plain rude. I can understand if they do not carry items I need, but he could have shown a little more professionalism. He first told me that he did not have any center caps for my car, that was fine, I started to ask another question and before I could even finish what I was going to ask he said "No, check on Ebay, we don't carry items for cars that old". If he had listened to me he would have found out that I was going to ask about wheels for one of my newer cars, and would have probably kept my business. But instead, he seemed to be too busy to deal with individual customers and I guess more focused in on his "fleet accounts". I guess he just wanted me out of his store, that is how he made me feel. This man needs to learn that some business accounts often come from a good experience from a regular customer. Also, if you are not willing to offer help on locating hard to find wheels and center caps as stated on your website, then you need to remove that from your list of services. So after being a regular customer for over 20 years, I will NEVER RETURN.]
