[104884961792628086531,100838310880045536082,Ours was a complicated case involving the death of my father. He recieved a head injury due to a fall while in the care of a facility. Chris was so kind to my sister and mother and I . He led us throught this process and made it as easy as he could on our mother. The case got very complicated and ended in a 5 hour Arbitration. He informed us of every detail along the way and was there with us throughout the ordeal. My sister and I both commented that he would e-mail us at all times of the night with questions and we often wondered when he slept. In the end he tried to prepare us for all prospective out comes, and was as delighted as we were when the Arbitration ended in our favor. We could not be happier with our experience with Chris.]
