[116844561162863908637,100240057540178843766,I just finished a full month at CrossFit Novem. Joining is one of the best decisions I have made in a long time. I am stronger, more flexible, and way more in shape. People have asked what I'm doing. All of the workouts are scalable, meaning you can come in there in great shape or less than great shape. The staff knows what they are doing and are fun. The other members of the gym are also awesome. The new location on Howard Street is incredible, too.]
