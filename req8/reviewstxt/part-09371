[107730525892106428135,100659174999792064334,Our two boys had routine visits scheduled where we found they would need some work done (fillings and extarctions). Due to some cancellations, there was actually time to do the work the same day we were there. No rescheduling, no anxiety, just done and moving on. So thankful Dr Scott could be so flexible.]
