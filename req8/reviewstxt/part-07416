[101588768059737098000,100555600153944973817,This is some of the very best Thai food I've had. Period. The restaurant isn't much to look at from the outside, as it's in a dinky strip mall in a concrete wasteland on the outskirts of Ypsilanti, MI. They did recently expand however, taking over the computer store next door. As you could reasonably be expected to wait 20-30 minutes for food once seated previously, the additional wait staff (well, one person currently) and much larger space is very welcome. But everything aside from the food is extraneous if the the former delivers, and by god, it does. The large and fairly varied menu stretches on for 40+ entrees, and after trying quite a few I can wholeheartedly recommend: -All 3 curries (red, yellow, green). They are all incredible; if spice is an issue, the green is by far the spiciest of the lot. -both fish dishes (choo chee, thai thai special). Fish always makes me nervous when its cooked and smothered in sauce, but the fish here is ALWAYS cooked perfectly and crispy, never soggy. delicious. -Tom Kha Gai, a coconut milk/lemongrass brothy soup with chicken. -Gai Kra Tiem Prig Thai - an irresistible chicken dish made with copious amounts of garlic and thai chili paste. amazing. -pretty much EVERYTHING else on the menu. I haven't been disappointed yet (though I've stayed pretty far from the dishes I consider boring, like pad thai and mongolian beef). check it out and support a great local business!]
