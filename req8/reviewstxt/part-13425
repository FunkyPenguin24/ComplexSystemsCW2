[115896968993505873021,100880749942097049049,I was very apprensive about hiring a limousine company i had not used before to drive us from Oregon City, Oregon to Tulalip Resort and Casino in Everett, Washington. It went perfectly!! Michael picked us up promptly at noon on Friday from our home and we were able to listen to music and watch DVD's, enjoy cocktails and snacks on the trip up. Ron picked us up from the casino on Sunday right after the Seahawks playoff game he was waiting out front. Again, perfect trip home. Both Ron and Michael were so nice to us and the limousine ride became part of a wonderful weekend rather than the daunting drive we usually do ourselves. I rate this company as EXCELLENT and will definitely use them anytime and recommend them highly to anyone else!! Thanks again Ron and Michael it was PERFECT surprise birthday for my husband!]
