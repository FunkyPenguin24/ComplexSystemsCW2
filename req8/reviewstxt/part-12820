[116617854491253190949,100847152315165517754,My beautiful relationship with Peter and Traci began a little more than two years ago. I was traumatized and truly clueless when it came to dealing with a car crash let alone an entire trial to follow; Peter and Traci were enthusiastic, supportive, and clear. P&T would break things down for me; primarily the law mumbo jumbo that went straight over my head. They were always positive but never tried to sugar coat any possible rough realities, which I deeply appreciated. I quickly bonded with the Anderson team and felt comfortable depicting my opinions and emotions. When the day came to physically go to trial I was beside myself with fear and apprehension. I do not think I could have walked in the court room had it not been for Traci and Peter's coaching. We practiced and mocked the trial process, they told me what sort of feelings to expect and not be surprised about, and they provided me with a few gizmos to calm myself incase my nerves went haywire! I could not thank Peter, Traci, and Kim enough; I am confident that no better people could have taken care of me during such an intense process! Love you all!]
