[106958595159070897911,100162876253004055549,This store posted a customer's personal info (name address and phone number) to their Facebook page along with a horrendous message with all kinds of 12 year-old level insults when said customer made a Reddit post about making a $1000 purchase and never getting the items. The store then refused to give a refund unless the Reddit post was deleted. Avoid this place like the plague.]
