[101999034503907162460,100298576819176386825,I agree with the women who ended up with sick dogs!! My dog was attending day and got sick on two occasion and the owner knew prior and never alerted anyone. I have been going there since it open and the ownership was polite and engaging....I have referred several people there before the incidence. Shannon the owner was rude and outrageous. The vets let me know there are often outbreaks there and they take no responsibility. Sad cause my dog actually liked the staff there. I guess once you think your successful you can stop being nice to loyal customers cause you think new ones can just replace us. I use to love it]
