[111605056721399122253,100736104616741760676,I have to say this dealership stepped up to the plate and redeemed themselves after my bad experience. You know the old saying that "one bad apple can spoil the bunch", well one good apple can impact an organization for the better as well. Our salesman, Jay Coats,was able to work us out a good deal on my new Camaro and I am thankful for not closing the door and missing out on getting this car. In spite of the obstacles I initially faced with a less than hospitable experience, Jay was able to wash all the negativity away and put me in the car at a descent price. He is kind and gracious ( two things that are rare to find these days). I love my new car, and I would recommend Jay Coats at Powers Swain Chevrolet if you are in the market for a new car to others. Thanks Jay!!]
