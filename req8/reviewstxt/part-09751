[111914865771779811390,100679594479832542388,When first thinking back on my start skydiving experience there dont seem to be many other words other than speechless, but on second thought I can think of a few off the top of my head. Marvelous, incredible, lifechanging, remarkable, fantastic, exceptional, and unprecedented!!!! The staff was perfect the plane was perfect and the jump went as well as I could have imagined. All in all I would say that if you go skydiving anywhere else you are making a huge mistake.]
