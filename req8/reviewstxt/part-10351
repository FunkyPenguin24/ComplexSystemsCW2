[109801292568036975720,100712622967251830305,THEY HAVE ALWAYS TAXED ME THE "FOR HERE" PRICE without asking if it was for here or to go. It's not the extra 26 cents I'm worried about, it's the principal. I'm thinking it's a bit of a scam to make extra money for them. Think about the 100's of people who walk through their doors every month. If everyone is taxed the "for here" price, then the money adds up. I'm wondering if that's illegal or not to not ask and to just asssume and charge people. I never notice them asking if it's for here or to go to anyone else either. SCAM! I'm reporting them to the BBB right away. The girl working there(Jessica) had an attitude when I inquired about it. She asked if I wanted my 26 cents back. I mention that I did, then she took it out of her tip jar, and threw it in my hand!!! WOW!!! Our youth has become a scum pool of wanna be gangsters with a bad attitude. I'm not returning there anytime soon. It's a shame because IO enjoy their yogurt, but not the attitude!!!!]
