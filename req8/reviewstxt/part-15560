[113848473575380544649,100997600453209304130,Horrible first time Midas experience - Went to get a belt replaced .. Told me it would cost $150 with belt and labor, then once they removed the belt, they start to tell me more parts that I HAVE TO HAVE in order for my belt to get replaced properly. Which was BS.... Bill ended up being $300 !! Plus when I checked my car in, the report said all my lights were working fine, then when it was pulled out, left front headlight was not working. I was very upset, asked to speak with the manager, and he offered to look at the headlight and if it was a bulb, that he would replace it at there cost. So he checked the headlight, pulled the bulb out, SHOWED THE BULB to me, and said "Nope, not the bulb, looks like we need some labor time to figure it out" I said YA RIGHT, come to find out, took it to a mechanical back home, IT WAS THE BULB!! LIED, OVERPRICED and just not right !!]
