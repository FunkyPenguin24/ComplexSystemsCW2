[115352661366296253698,100194415349812029981,Horrible experience - don't take your car here!!!!! Took my 2004 Nissan Pathfinder in (which is in great shape - has been garaged every day and night of it's existence) for a full detailing - spent $130...and now the car is worse than it was! Scratches and nicks that weren't there before, wet floor mats wadded up in the back, numerous areas that I had to wipe down (spent over 2 hours wiping the car down after I got it home). I'm not even certain that they actually waxed it (paint finish didn't have that "glassy smooth" feeling that it normally has after a wax...felt no smoother than when I brought it in...was waxed there about a year ago). Sadly, I am now going to have to take it somewhere else and spend another $100+ to undo the damage they did!]
