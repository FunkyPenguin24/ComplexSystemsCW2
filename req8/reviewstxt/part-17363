Instead of repairing a dent on my car, they actually caused more damage, then started with the nonsensical excuses that went from because it's plastic to you can't expect too much for what you paid... Businesses like this should not be allowed to remain open because what they're doing is simply using a CA license to rip people off with shoddy work.]
