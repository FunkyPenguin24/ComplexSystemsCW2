[110202788284832865330,100737609249621798116,Went to have patches sewn on a vest. Was told it would be 9$ a patch. The lady was rude and acted like they didn't want my business. The only reason I stopped in was the business I like to use was too busy to get me in that day. Ill wait patiently instead of being treated like an idiot. By the way my place charges 2.00 a patch no matter what size.]
