[104870737380947644267,100760301631624855945,Allure Dental Spa is the best dentist I have had the chance to see. I went in without a lot of Dental Problems that I have been trying to fix for years, and I am finally getting them fixed. I leave Allure Dental Spa with very minimum pain if any. My last visit, I had several cavaties and a crown and knew I would be in a lot of pain after I left. To my suprise, I did not have any pain. The staff is very friendly, and I always feel welcome. The staff always knows my name,and I feel like I can talk to them for hours. Its a very friendly and relaxing environment. The Allure is very flexible to my schedule, and I can tell they want me as a patient. I would highly recommend Allure Dental Spa. I can say enough about the doctor and the staff. I know I have and im still receiving excellent care. I cant wait for the end result.]
