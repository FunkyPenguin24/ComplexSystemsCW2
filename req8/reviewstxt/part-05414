[101726467582219887370,100447119555422094032,My nephew went here over a year ago and that is how I found out about La Petite. My son has been attending there for a little less then a year, I love having him here. The staff members are so nice and if I or Tammy have questions/concerns there is no hesitation to speak to each other. I'm glad to have chosen La Petite for childcare for my 10 y/o. The hours are perfect and they are able to transport my son to his school which is really important for my son & I!]
