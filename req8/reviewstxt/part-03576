[105932102212252140963,100345229717493296342,My sister has been working with Sean in order to prepare for college next year. She attended his ACT Prep course after taking the ACT once before. After the course, she signed up and took it again and her score jumped four points! Sean has a way with getting his students to understand how to excel at the ACT. He also does a great job working with students in writing essays and filling out applications for college and scholarship applications. His knowledge is beyond reproach and the students seem to respond to him very well. I would recommend Sean for those considering the daunting task of helping a loved one start their college preparations!]
