[108583629015166404496,100453184701435365031,I first met your artist Michael when he drew caricatures of the guests at a Professional Women's event. He made everyone look so fun and happy. So I hired him for a special birthday celebration at my home. Michael was terrific! He worked constantly and all my guests loved the result. Everyone went home with a "party favor" of a delightful caricature of themselves as a single, couple, or small group. Please tell him thanks so much for his hard work and his amazingly cheerful self.]
