[117847321561304656383,100643117615695548934,Before I visited Dr. Carr, I was in pain due to wearing those cute boots that I know I should throw away! In one visit, I was realigned and was able to workout as usual. I would recommend Dr. Carr to anyone in pain that needs a doctor who will listen to you and do a full assessment before going forward. You definitely don't feel like you are going to get roped into 40 visits and a life long payment plan. A refreshing change from other chiropractors whose servicews I used to use!]
