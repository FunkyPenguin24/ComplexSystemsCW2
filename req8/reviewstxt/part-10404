[107602358324413759785,100715364173123134576,SLUM LORDS!! The whole time I lived there they refused to respond to my calls about the mold in my ceiling and hole from the rain, rain leaking all over my carpet and belongings. For three months they refused to repair it then when I left there without them ever doing their part they tried to bill me for supposedly not cleaning the place! LIARS- my apartment was clean except for their failure to keep up maintenance AND they never gave me the $100 referral fee I earned by referring a friend and continue to hunt me down with a $300 credit report claim saying I owe them money when the reverse is actually true. The manager will NEVER come to the phone and getting any sort of professional help from them is a pipe dream. Drugs in the apartments of neighbors are smelled through the inside hallway and shared vents. the community utility set up is such a rip off- you are charged at least $125 a month for heat that you have NO CONTROL OVER. They turn it on for the whole building in Sept. and don;t turn it off until Memorial Day. Half the time you have to open the window just to be able to breathe and not die from heat on warm nights- but, then YOU have to pay for the fact they run their heat 24 hrs a day 9 months a year! The people they hire suck and their turn over rate is out of this world, the first office manager they had when I lived there was asking me if I could get her painkillers right after I signed my lease! Stay Away from here they are selfish assholes who do not care about anything except screwing you over for as much money as possible.]
