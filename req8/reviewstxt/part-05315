[110878641889973265271,100441871491563131158,This mall needs a little updating. They closed early without notice, it would have been nice for them to have a sign posted on the door that they will be closing early on New Years Eve. At any rate were able to take in about 2 to 3 stores and the sales were fairly decent. If you're already on the road traveling passed the outlet you can make it a point to stop in and take advantage of their deals. But don't make a special trip because it would be a waste of time and money with the price of gas being so high]
