[105799297198922946120,101135040913748887813,I had a horrible experience with newington gun exchange. Their service was horrible from start to finish. It started with sending my ffl info and the rude people who responded that they were too busy to get it by fax In the end I received an ar15 rifle with no bolt carrier group. They claim it was n the buffer tube when they sent it . Needless to say no bcg in packaging either. On the phone they said they would take care of it then I hear from the customer they said I was lying and took the bcg. I called to verify over the weekend and got more run around. Needless to say four days no calls were returned and no heads up on my bcg and if they were going to d the right thing like they told me. I called 5 times to get tracking and they were always too busy for that too. I was other told to call tomorrow or call back on Thursday to get a tracking number. I got nothing but the run a round from day one. This will be my first review of many on this place as well as detailed thoroughly on my blog and social networking sites. Stay away from these guys. There has to be a better option for you guys up in Newington, CT.]
