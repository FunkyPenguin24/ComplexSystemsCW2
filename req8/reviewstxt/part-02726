[106798611557451204490,100299291204388244744,Our party of five had a sampling of several menu items, about half of which was okay and the other half terrible. The staff adamantly refused to remove one of the terrible meals from our bill after we requested a substitute entree. The service was spotty, extremely slow and made several mistakes. The only bright spot of this visit was the view of Seneca Rocks. I highly recommend going elsewhere.]
