[100693999810822841575,100131232922879704226,My 1996 subaru needed a bit of tlc for the front bumper and fog lights. When I brought it in, everyone at DMI from the receptionist to the mechanics were extremely helpful and welcoming. They kept me up to date on the repairs, and it was rapidly fixed despite having to deal with insurance procedures. If you have any need for body work, and want both a competent and friendly place to do it, I would definitely recommend DMI]
