[100939846794472693145,100428436866984568830,Both of our children ages 17 and 15 loved their experiecnce with Dr. Gray and his Staff (family to us). Each and everytime we entered Dr. Gray's office we felt like we were part of the family. Each member of his staff knew our names and took awesome care of both our children. We were explained what would be done at that visit and before we left what we could expect at our next visit. Scheduling of appointments and even emergencies were easy. The financing options were abundent. We highly recommend Dr. Gray and his staff. Thank you for caring about our children and giving them such beautiful smiles. W.M.]
