[101976524052538478544,100349147782059652005,I called and complained. These guys are the most unfriendly, unprofessional, lack of service individuals I have ever met. When I first walked into to rent the truck the guy behind the counter acted as if I was bothering him with my presence. He mumbled though the entire rental process and became upset when I asked him to repeat himself numerous times. After I checked the damage on the truck I returned in the office and watched both Customer service reps chat between themselves. When I alerted them I had a concern with 5 oclock traffic and driving a large truck and that I really needed to complete this process and get on the road. I was treated to "Sir we will get to you when we can, we have other customers and we get to you once we are done with them." They were done with all the customers and they were just chatting. The truck was great and worked prefect for the job I needed. The price was also reasonable. When I returned the truck @ 4:52PM, 8 min before closing, the office was locked and the customer service rep was sitting behind the counter counting money and listening to an Ipod. I beat on the window and when I finally got his attention I asked if I could get a quick estimate of my total charges based on miles and number of days rented. He laughed at me and "said they were closed and that I could check my bank statement tomorrow to see how much I was charged" My estimate would have taken him 2 Min. And it was not 5 PM yet. I informed him that service at this location was terrible and that I was calling Uhaul to file a formal complaint. He laughed, shut the door, and put his ear phones back into his ear. I am dissatisfied to say the least. Robert From Baton Rouge LA]
