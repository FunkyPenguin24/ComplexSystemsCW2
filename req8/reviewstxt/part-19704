[100238585150507675831,100044086452589487930,I have travelled for 40 years and do not consider myself a picky traveller. However I have rarely been so disappointed. Rented two rooms for two nights. From the check-in process, to the room, food, amenities and internet, there is only one word for this place. It is a fleabag. It was not clean, things were broken all over the place, the internet did not work. To make matters worse, the price quoted ($110) was not the price charged ($140). Even for $50 a night, I could never recommend this place. The only positives were that the bed was flat and the TV worked. My advice? STAY AWAY AND BOOK ELSEWHERE.]
