[111039575796331006960,100274485203330229642,First the good things.. - The coffee is great - food is really good - atmosphere is relaxed, very much like Capitol Hill coffee shops - easy access to parking Now for the bad parts. - No Wifi (not even pay for Wifi) - No power outlets - your laptop is on battery power only! :( - No Credit/Debit Card accepted <-- wha? - They discourage lounging, ie to much studying, talking or computer usage when they get crowded. Serious - check the 'rules' section of web site. For coffee shop thats 10 minutes from Microsoft's main campus I can NOT fathom how this place survives. It has so much potential to be a great east side substitute for relaxed old school neighborhood Seattle brew house. However, its shortcomings are too significant.]
