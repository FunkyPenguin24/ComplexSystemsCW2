[104491493316574427501,100600226321152908119,I have rented from Long & McQuade a few times for Zumba fundraisers. I have always had a great experience. The rental staff, I've often had Conan, are great. They take the time to explain how the equipment works and make sure that you have everything that you need. Renting a system from here is much cheaper than using an AV company. The only catch is that you are responsible for picking it up, setting it up and bringing it back. Will happily contine renting from them as long as I need any sound equipment. I've refered them to friends and other instructors multiple times.]
