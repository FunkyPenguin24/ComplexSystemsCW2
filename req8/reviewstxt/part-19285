[100350373057547334237,100021848547441540125,My aunt and i went into Studio 28 on Saturday night, 8.11.12, with intentions of getting our tattoos (my 4th and my aunts 3rd). we already knew what we wanted but were skeptic on where we would begetting them done. we wanted a nice clean place with the right attitudes. When we got to Studio 28, TJ greeted us and was very helpful. He talked with us until the artist was ready to take us on. Paul, our artist, "An Englishman in New York" was amazing! He did such a great job with our tats and both my aunt and i are very impressed with his work. Not only did he provide excellent service but he was really nice too. Paul's work is hanging up on the walls and shows his true artistic ability. We are very pleased with Paul's ink skills! The shop was very clean and their equipment was very sterile, my aunt is a nurse, so i feel very comfortable when she does! Great place and i can't wait for my next tat. i will definitely be going to Studio 28 to see Paul. Cheers!]
