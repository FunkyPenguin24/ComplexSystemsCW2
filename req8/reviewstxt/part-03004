[102891430296651883549,100314978634813534791,My family and I were vacationing in Coeur d'Alene last summer, and on a whim, we decided to rent a boat to check out the lake. We called around, and chose KJ Watersports. We arrived at their location, and met with an employee that walked us through the sign-up process. She answered all of our questions quickly and efficiently, and got us on our way. Another staff member towed the boat to the lake, got it off the trailer and tied it up to the dock. All we had to do was hop in, and enjoy. The boat was in great condition, and perfect for our little outing. We had a great time riding the tube, exploring the shoreline, and enjoying the nice weather. Turn in was a breeze. We met a KJ employee at the dock, hopped out, and he took care of the rest. We followed him to the gas station to refill the boat's tank, and we were on our way. I recommend KJ Watersports very highly, and hope your experience is as good as ours was.]
