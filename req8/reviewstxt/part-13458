[105611068402465846140,100882822955859968530,Having always been something of a nervous patient I decided to take the plunge and made the decision to fix my smile in 2014. The reception team were really helpful when I called and quickly helped book me in for my consultation. The consultation (conducted by James) was very thorough and he was fantastic at alleviating my historic fears while explaining different options open to me. I've since been twice and, while still not the most fearless patient, would definitely recommend Bow Lane Dental Group to any other nervous patients out there.]
