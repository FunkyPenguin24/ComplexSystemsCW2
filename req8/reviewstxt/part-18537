[106136200924978516150,101158065727858128215,This restaurant is one of the longest surviving in SOHO. That is quite something - if your food is not good you do not last for more than 13 years in the same spot! Sole Mio is known for the freshly baked bread, roasted fresh garlic and freshly grated Parmesan cheese served when you sit down. The Pizzas are paper thin - just as I like it and the risotto is creamy and excellent. The new revised lasagne recipe is to die for! The most amazing characteristic is how accommodating Sole Mio is - I often request angelhair (capellini) with Fresh pesto - and although not on the menu - owner In Gurung goes out of his way to please. Arabiata and Putenesca .... you ask for any pasta cooked to perfection - you can have any sauce. This restaurant has become a legend and I ALWAYS go back. If you have not tasted the freshly made Tiramisu - you have not tasted heaven.... On a scale of 1 to 10 - I give Sole Mio a 12!!]
