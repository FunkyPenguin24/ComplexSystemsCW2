[101161689241795723871,100303331196330658492,I have eaten cupcakes, cookies, cakes, some sort of 'atomic ball' (I forget the name), and have seen large cakes designed by Shockley's Sweet Shoppe. The cupcakes/cakes (they sometimes sell small cakes) are delicious. The designs they come up with are not only top notch, they are original. They are not copying other peoples designs, they are creating their own and setting trends. (See their chocolate/vanilla split cake that has been in magazines) I have watched the staff deal with me and others with utmost respect and professionalism. I have sat there eating a cupcake and watch people come in, buy cupcakes or pick up cakes and stay 15-20 minutes just to talk to them. I can not recommend Shockley's Sweet Shop enough!]
