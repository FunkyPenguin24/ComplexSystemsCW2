[108849223718656753977,100253765864443549530,A Turkish friend took me here and we had brilliant food - the meat was really succulent and everything was really fresh tasting. It would be great if you felt like something healthy because many of dishes are vegetable-heavy and grilled or prepared lightly. No skimping on flavours though. The mixed grill was a highlight. And try the Turkish white wine - surprisingly great!]
