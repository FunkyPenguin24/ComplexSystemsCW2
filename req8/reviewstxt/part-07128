[104075915039144460862,100539154690569294465,I live on the west side and decided to stop by Jolly's. In being out of Aquariums for over ? 25 yrs. I started up a 55gal Saltwater so Mom will have something else to watch ( other then the TV ). Upon entering, I was greeted by Fay and Steve came over and helped me out. He was very knowledgeable. Though I have not purchased any fish yet and he suggested I start with just a live rock and let my tank cycle. So for now, looking good ! After I purchase some fish, I'll update with another review.]
