[116650231962262577378,100965688316168510540,Parked at 13th & Glisan - called in about the penalty notice I received, Talked to a young man that could give a c**p about my issue I advised him that I tried to pay at the meter. He told me that if the meter is having issues I need to call. Advised him I was reading the BIG sign that says public parking after 5pm and weekends, he was very kind to inform me that that just means that the public can park there nights and weekends for a fee. I said well after the meter would not take my payment if figured it was just like the street meters that it was a free time to park. He advised me that no that is not what it means and that I need to pay the $44 charge. Paid my fine and was still upset so I called back to see about maybe getting the fine reduced or any kind of consideration and the answer was "NO" we are not empowered to do anything for you. I then asked if I could send in a letter to express my frustration at the situation was advised that I could send it in to the address on the notice but no one is going to change it. I work in customer service, that nice thing would have been to say something like we love feed back please feel free to send in your comments and we will review them or something. You have a notice saying your call might be recorded and after this experience that feels like a total CYA issue and you "as a company" could give a flying &*&^ about your customers.]
