[106897237756349624958,100992135681929863067,My experience at St. Louis Tattoo Company was excellent. I took my son and we both got tats at the same time. We both loved them. I got the Punisher breakout pictured above and my son got a Pantera Dimebag Darrel tribute tat. In fact I am going back tomorrow to get a Harley Davidson Skull tattoo with black flames. I can't wait. I highly recommend this place and it's artists. They are excellent. See you tomorrow Mr. House. Kenny J. St. Louis, MO.]
