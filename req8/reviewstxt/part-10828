[106444202343113353541,100738302767131047920,Since my wife and I both work 10 hours a day, every once in a while we decide to "have a sandwich" instead of cooking. This Subway location always has nice friendly people working. We NEVER feel like we're getting "The bums rush" to "order and get out!!!", instead we hang back, let others go in front of us as we decide what we want to order. When ready, we always feel like the folks there are not distracted and we have never had to "correct" anything. The only "non excellent" item is the decor - how the heck do you make an "Excellent decor" in a strip mall franchise sandwich shop?? Ahh, whatever ... Good place - Clean, nice people, generous with the veggies. Recommended.]
