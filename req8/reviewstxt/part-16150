[107421759068367210075,101029237804134159380,Great cust service, punctual technician service. Had terrible outside wiring that the tech (contractor) fixed, but went around the guttering instead of under it. Getting full rate (22Mbps, what I'm paying for) on speed tests, video tiles only occassionally downstairs but would have required a lot of digging/drilling to fix so the tech convinced me to leave it alone. Lockbox lid falling off the building, allowing theft, weathering, bugs, and vandalism. Trouble with HBO GO sometimes over 3G, but that's not Comcast's issue. Love the multi-room DVR! Wish the tech had been more thorough in rewiring, but video service works 99% of the time and internet is NEVER down. Very proud to be a Comcast customer.]
