[101738693565408619445,100635355105618701625,I bought the Guardsmen Elite furniture protection plan for $173. When it came time to make a claim, they denied it out of hand by simply saying "not covered." What a rip-off. Don't buy insurance from these people, and don't buy leather unless you want it to fall apart with very little use.]
