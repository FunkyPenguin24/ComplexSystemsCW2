[105091926184437620699,100827199339616170881,Super nice, personable staff. Highly recommend the technician Anuish who patiently took all the time I needed to explain the procedure and what I could expect. That laser KILLS tattoos, and my ridiculous mark of shame was completely removed in much less time than expected. Thanks, Precision Laser Tattoo Removal -- excellent service. I can't wait to get another tattoo to have you remove it a month later, lol.]
