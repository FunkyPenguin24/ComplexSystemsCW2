[100506108484316782825,100439146453574408972,I've been to Clairmont Animal Hospital three times with my cat Otto, and have been extremely impressed with the quality of care he received from Dr. Smith. He knows what he's doing, and it shows. Unfortunately, on my last visit, Dr. Smith discovered a baseball sized tumor. I want to sincerely thank Dr. Smith and his staff for the care and compassion given to both Otto and myself. I also want to thank Dr. Smith for doing what he could to make Otto comfortable in his final hours because it gave me time to say goodbye. I will HIGHLY recommend Clairmont Animal Hospital to everyone.]
