[105746093201034308507,100626739253392204855,My fiance & I found this place a few days after moving to Louisville. We decided to stop for lunch...that was the best find since we moved. Since then we have probably eaten there at least 30 times in the 9 months we have lived here. We have brought our entire family here for multiple occasions...15-20 at a time. We were so worried moving from NYC/NJ that we would never find sushi like we had up north. WRONG! :-) The food is divine, the service great, the owner and employees just amazing people. It's our place for sushi or just a good meal in general. You can not go wrong. The Buddha Roll, The Tropical Tuna Roll and the Snow White Roll are to die for. Bona Petite!]
