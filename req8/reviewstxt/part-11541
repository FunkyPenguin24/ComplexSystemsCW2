[102247654831748276540,100775802732886346103,Had a great experience working with Jordon's. The inventory was great, lots to choose from. Once I order the sofa, chair and ottoman (price was reasonable) they were delivered when they said they would be. The installation/movers set everything up making sure all the hardwood floors were projected and took away all the packing materials when they were done. I would recommend Jordon's again. Thanks]
