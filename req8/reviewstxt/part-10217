[117462777575425444385,100705527292595254873,My husband & I have appreciated Dr. Hodge's services for 35 years. My husband had some very bad experiences in the military with dental care. When he heard Dr. Hodge and and his staff "catered to cowards", he gave in to getting dental care with Dr. Hodge. In addition, all three of my daughters & their families value his compassionate dental care. My youngest daughter would wait until she was home from Tennessee and Germany to trust her dental care to Dr. Hodge. I have appreciated the positive environment in Dr. Hodge's office carried through by his caring staff. I also appreciate how Dr. Hodge integrates the latest technology and how he involves his patients in determining what strategy for care will be provided. There have never been surprises from unexpected expenses. I have also referred friends & family who had dental emergencies. Not only were they worked in immediately, they are still Dr. Hodge's patients and trust him with their dental care.]
