[103884225622099649533,100545921382487759868,My wife randomly picked this dentist from the list our insurance gave us, and it turned out to be very good. I had a previous dentist in town that was more like a used car dealer than a dentist. This place though was laid back and very relaxed, but very professional. I still don't like going to see the dentist, but as I told the office when I left, I enjoyed my visit about as much as a trip to the dentist could be.]
