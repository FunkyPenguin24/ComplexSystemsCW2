[102978777742173817526,100973317071887943825,I recently bought a car from Laurel BMW of Westmont. This was my second BMW so I wasn't a stranger to the type of service provided by the brand. That being said, the team did a fantastic job. The service was excellent and the entire staff was courteous, attentive and knowledgeable. Highly recommended.]
