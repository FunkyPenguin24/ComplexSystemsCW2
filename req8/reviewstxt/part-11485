[101423365444221089324,100772717190443483496,My bad experiences with this bank are multiple so where to begin is the question - 1.) Couldn't get into my online accounts using FF. I am a software engineer and a web designer so i know my way around software. After going back and forth they tell my my security settings are too high and i need to lower them to access my accounts. Lower my securities to access my very precious bank information is not a solution. 2.) I transferred money to my business account (that is now with DCU) and I double checked everything. My online accounts showed the transfers. The next day I'm hit with over 100.00 in over draft fees because the money I though was there disappeared and all the items I paid out were over limit. 3.) I talk to a woman at the main branch to dispute the over drafts. I will replace the money I say but I don't want to pay the overdrafts. She says the same thing happened to her accounts at the bank just recently. Items in the online register are gone and you are left in overdraft mode. 2 days later the bank transfers 750.00 from my personal account to my business account to cover the overage without asking or getting my approval leaving my personal account in disarray and with over draft fees. 4.) I tried to purchase a part for my stove and it got rejected. Thinking I had typed so I tried again. I use my Paypal card attached to my account and the transaction goes through. I suddenly realize that all my transactions on my card are being rejected. Turns out I was purchasing something out of state and this is not allowed so they shut off my card. I mentioned this to DCU when I started moving accounts, they said they will contact me to verify the purchase not just shut off the card. These are only 4 reasons to not trust these people with your money. Sure the tellers are all nice but the infrastructure of the bank is very unstable.]
