[102115427549405340228,100089669159212254238,We've been here 3 times and never been greeted. It wasn't even a busy Saturday those days. They also don't deal over email so you can't cut out all the BS sales talk and just get a price. Very backwards thinking, annoying dealer. They also put a really annoying Gary Lang sticker on your bumper if you were buy a car from them, just so you know.]
