[112241869866877009709,100311091752047384916,I was in search of a replacement Expedition because my engine had went up in my 2001. I stumbled across this place in Annapolis on line that had what I was looking for, so I made the trip from Baltimore to see if the vehicle would be worth the purchase. To my surprise, ACC was by far, the best used car dealer I had ever been to. The 2007 was in excellent shape, it ran extremely smooth, they gave me the car fax upon request, they provided finance for the vehicle with a better rate then my bank, and there service was so wonderful. So wonderful that my wife traded her car in on the spot and bought one also. We came home with 2 cars and only went to get one... Great service will do that to you. I will most definitely be sending my family and friends who are in search of a vehicle to the Annapolis Car Center. Pastor JT]
