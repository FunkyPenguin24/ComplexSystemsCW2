[111507758458508974456,100410615669061683741,Went to Cafe Colore this weekend before a show at Comedy Works and was highly disappointed. I've been there several times before and have always enjoyed quick service and great food, but this time was different. After ordering a Chicken dish, it was raw when it arrived at the table. We were in a hurry so we asked what could be prepared quickly so we didn't miss our show and received glorified spaghetti and meatballs (not great tasting either I might add). The real kicker was when the bill came and the manager acted like a 15% discount was a favor. Having worked in the industry, usually you just take the meal off all together, especially when your mistake could have given someone salmonella. Being in a hurry, we tipped our waiter who was attentive and kind, paid our bill and left. Needless to say however, with poor management and worse cooking, we will not be returning.]
