[106530738197188281113,101011386309286863370,I was in NOLA for my birthday with 6 close friends. We came to Franks to try out Muffalettas and other various fare that New Orleans is famous for. Right off the bat, Gio our waiter informed us that we could only use 2 credit cards to pay our bill. Okay fine. Our food was okay. The Bloody Marys and Hurricanes nice and strong. That's all I can honestly say that was nice about the place. When it came time to pay our bill, five of us paid with cash and two of us paid with credit cards. A week after our trip, my friend looks at her card statement and lo and behold, she's been charged with the entirety of our bill. Which means our charming waiter probably pocketed the cash and charged my friend with the bill. NOT COOL. When my friend called the restaurant to get her money back, she got the run around from the accountant and Gio. Now she has her bank fighting the $200+ charge to her card. AVOID a restaurant like this!]
