[100080880737238219882,100785798128095956788,This is obviously not a gourmet restaurant. We came there only because the cafe at the MARQ museum (check that out!) was closed. It looks shabby from the outside, the menu in english is very limited and that goes for the owners as well. BUT - we had some of the best seafood on the trip for a very reasonable price. And there was surely enough of it with the two of us having a healthy appetite. The second time we came, because we just had to, we were greeted with warmth. After pointing to a large poster showing Alicante in 1962, he came back with a stack of old photos from Alicante, and we had the pleasure of going through those. Our warmest recommendations for some good, honest, tasty and plentiful food for a reasonable prise - a most authentic experience :)]
