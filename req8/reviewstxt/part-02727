[105753727012246205674,100299412730713212409,Edgewood Animal Hospital is the best vet clinic we have ever attended. The office is located right down the street from our home so it is convenient to pick up food and prescriptions. Not only that, but all the workers are so kind, friendly, and offer top notch customer service. One of our dogs has had both knees operated on and thanks to Dr. Bruce, he is like a puppy again. He is 13 years old and is kept comfortable in his senior years through the use of medicine, exercise, and the loving care of EAH. Our other dog is 10 years old and was diagnosed as diabetic 3 years ago. I'm convinced that he has lived this long, comfortably, because of EAH and their treatment plan. We are kept up-to-date with the needs of our pets through postcards and emails. We are never left in the dark with where they stand in regards to their health and well-being. Although EAH is pricier than other vets, I am happy to pay a little more for such great care.]
