[106886531645673673243,100959038110395054356,I liked the sangría with sorbet, but frankly I have had better ones in other places such as Café Ibérico in Chicago and Dominick's in Ann Arbor Michigan. Morcilla Tapas is overpriced and paying $5.99 for a tiny cafe flan that did not have anything special was too much. Coffee at $2.75 per a cup, only because it's from Spain? Oh well... I am still thinking that $70.00 for two people was too much. And not really marvelous service, but on top of that I added a 15% gratuity. I will never come back.]
