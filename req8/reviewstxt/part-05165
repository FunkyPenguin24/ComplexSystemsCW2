[102219200352980819168,100432374550424421718,I have been to the Lakeland pool a number of times. Once as the parent of a guest at a birthday party. Once while hosting a birthday party for my 10-year old. A few times individually with my family of four children. Each time the children had a blast. We feel as though the value for the enjoyment is top notch. The only reason I am giving the pool a "2" rather than a "3" is due to the parking situation and signage. We had a hard time finding the parking lot the first time. The most recent time we went, we parked near one of the large ventilation tubes coming out of the ground. When we got back to our car it was covered in a rust-colored film. We washed it as soon as we got home, and it did not all come off. We're very upset by this damage to our vehicle. There should not be parking near this exhaust.]
