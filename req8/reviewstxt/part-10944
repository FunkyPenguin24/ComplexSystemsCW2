[113723644043951882276,100744206028064479484,I bought £30 of diesel ( definitely diesel out of the black pump marked diesel and diesel on the receipt) at this station today on top of £10 worth already in the tank and the car immediately became gutless and wouldn't go above 50. Went to the gas station at Barton Mills and filled it to the brim with diesel and immediately the car regained power though not to 100%. Tried to ring the garage and could not get through. Will never use this garage again!]
