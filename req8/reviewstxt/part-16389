[115169888561190883143,101041539462640011488,Our family's been enjoying Piccadilly's food for 30 years. My children grew up on their food, and now we are bring our grandchildren to Piccadilly. The selection is exceptional, and the food is always seasoned perfect. The servers are always on their toes to help with anything you wish for. We drive around 40 miles to eat at Piccadilly once to three times a week. It's worth the time and the drive!]
