[107601886239184914212,100475292623971673027,I really had an efficient and fast closing in March 2011 with Pacific when I did a slightly complex simultaneous transaction - the sale of my existing sailboat and the purchase of my powerboat. People's bank did all the financing - great folks. The sailboat was sold by Ryan at Swiftsure Yachts and the powerboat broker was Dan Wood of Crow's Nest. Everyone did a great job (lender, brokers and escrow closer) and I was very pleased. Like riding the magic carpet, it went so smooth. Sorry it took a while to get around to writing the review. Good jobs folks! J. MaGee, Tacoma, WA.]
