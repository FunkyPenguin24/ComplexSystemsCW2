[106159159560710901537,100524828042117358083,I came to this restaurant because there was a guy outside with a sign that said 5 dollar buffet. So when I went inside there were like 10 more people. Some people were arguing about the fact that there buffet was empty because all the pizzas were consumed and no new pizzas came. It took like 8 minutes for new pizzas to come. Pizzas tasted great but the selection was not big. The waitress was not so great, no refills were offered and my sweet tea tasted more than water than tea. When I checked my receipt it said 6.49 for the buffet so I felt uncomfortable because I came for the single reason that they were advertising 5 dollar buffet. I honestly do not plan ever going back because they made me feel uncomfortable, waitress should be better service oriented, check should be correct, iced tea shouldn't taste like water and most important, in a buffet people should not wait more that 8 minutes for new pizza to come...]
