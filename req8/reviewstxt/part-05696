[109589497454893182276,100461201772024439288,We went here, my sister and I -- pleasantly surprised! We sat at the "counter" with old time stools and a beautiful blue iridescent counter. We ordered the omelet with hash browns and a beverage. VERY GOOD, service was good also. I would recommend and I would go back. The pies looked great, prices were all reasonable.]
