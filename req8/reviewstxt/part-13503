[109503827894936111779,100885536702240003080,I accidentally discovered Georges by mistake, but since doing so I have been hooked, the food is very good and plenty of it you will not be hungry or disapointed when you leave, and they do infact stand behind any dish served, without argument or haste, this is in my book a very enjoyable restaurant to eat there or get it to go either way, I highly recommend eating there and you must try there hot pastrami sub its the best, I have now been a customer for the past 6 months. The burgers are char broiled and thick, bring big hands with you because you will need them both....enjoy]
