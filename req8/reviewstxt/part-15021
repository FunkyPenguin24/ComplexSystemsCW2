[102854645142817940443,100968112603437580753,I cancelled my membership with them, after I was out of contract, and after 2 months of wrangling, they finally cancelled my membership, but then proceeded to bill me 3 months after. Thank God for American Express. They reversed the charges and blocked Golds from charging my account. Then, about 2 months after Amex blocked them, they continued billing under a different merchant account. Amex again reversed the charges and blocked the other merchant account and cancelled my card and reissued for me. This is an awful company. Even if you wanted to pay cash for the year, they won't do it. They require a credit card or checking account with monthly billing. In other words, they want the opportunity to bend you over at some point in the relationship. This isn't how you do business. This is not Joe Gold's gym of back in the day. This is a BS corporation and I hope they go down in flames.]
