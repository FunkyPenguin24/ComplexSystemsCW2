After having a horrible experience at a different restaurant years ago, my family was leery to try Indian food again. Once I finally convinced them we should go, they were in heaven. There lunch buffet is great, there naans are delicious (they have peshwari naan!), and their soups, curries, and other dishes are all fantastic! You can request different spiciness levels, which I greatly appreciate, and their waitstaff is very friendly. They also always have Indian music videos or clips from Bollywood films playing on one of the TVs - which I find quite entertaining to watch. After dinner, if you still have room for any more food, their desserts and chai tea are also very nice. Even living half an hour away, we go here as often as we can, and I cannot recommend it enough.]
