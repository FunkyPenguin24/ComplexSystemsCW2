[105567601704046517956,100478491628147754295,Nice decor and food pretty decent at reasonable prices . Shame the service let's it down a bit. The staff are friendly but take their time getting drinks or coming to get your order. Would visit again but for coffee and a cake next time. Update... Came back for my coffee and cake. Coffee was lukewarm and carrot cake was disappointing! Such a shame......]
