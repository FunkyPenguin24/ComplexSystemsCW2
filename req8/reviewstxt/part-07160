[105170294613136685419,100541200362512144368,Great customer service! Stopped by with my sister to have her take a look to see if she even cared for Subarus....she didn't care much for style, The gentleman (Hameed) who helped us was very knowledgeable and kind and answered all of her questions...he wasn't pushy at all which we appreciated. Would recommend this dealership if you are thinking about purchasing a Subaru.]
