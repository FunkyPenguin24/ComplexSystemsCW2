[101811155710228378307,100817523771771115037,We dined at the Jackson MI Denny's a few nights ago and it was HORRID. For starters, the place looked like a total junk hole. Musty odor, a faint hint of cigarette smoke lingered in the stale air of old grease. The tables were sticky, so I took out an alcohol wipe out to clean off the table...THE WIPE TURNED GREEN FOR GODS SAKE!!! Enough to sicken me right there and then, but let us move on. I ordered a limited dish inspired by the film "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey" that is two pieces of bread with a fried egg in the middle, bacon hash browns and a sausage link. The dish came, no bacon hash browns, no huge deal right? Nope. I told the waitress that they were supposed to have bacon and she began to lecture me about what the menu says. So I get fed up and sent it back. Next thing I know the manager comes out to lecture me on my meal, that AND I QUOTE "So you didn't like our Hobbit Holes (innuendo!) The waitress put it in as 50-50 (bacon and sausage) so yes it was wrong". Hey ding bat, it had nothing to do with that...the problem was that the hash browns had no bacon!!! My friend asked for a box to take his burger (which I must say looked quite good for such crap service) home...AND THE MANAGER TOLD HIM TO SHUT UP!!! By that time I was done and fed up with these braindead people...then another dude came by and asked "So I hear you didn't like the Hobbit Holes?"...he had no association with any of this that was going on (I assume he may have been a cook) so why is he butting in? Nosy wankers...We left Denny's extremely angered and sickened by the horrid service. This place should be closed!!! That is how bad it was! There were people in there complaining about their food being wrong, the coffee tasting really bad, the lack of cleanliness and just the horrible service. I STRONGLY ADVISE YOU TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS DENNY'S. IT IS BY FAR THE WORST I HAVE EVER BEEN TO. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!]
