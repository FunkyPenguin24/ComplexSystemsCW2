[105013762314672792082,100466905988074262437,Great food, excellent service. Decor is very mediocre but it's a great place to eat regardless. Convenient location across from the Four Seasons. Lots of employees from that hotel come in there to eat, which says a lot in that the food is very good, fast service, reasonable prices. Food reminds me of a Chipotle but with a little more individualized feel.]
