[104284250307580114392,100493818058341468238,Just returned from a lovely trip to Sharm, the weather is perfect in November. Hotel staff were friendly, food is good for an all-inclusive, and the reef area that the hotel provide free access to (10 minutes by bus) is both lovely and amazing. Why not five stars? - we had brown water (in small quantities) for three days, had to wash using outside showers - the room was a 10 minute walk from reception, above a shopping area with the room beneath ours still being built, though this was only noisy for on one morning of our stay. - the hotel has rats, despite its many (many) cats - real fruit juice was prohibitively expensive, despite many local sellers trading pomegranates and mangoes... a shame. - on leaving they made two mistakes with the bill, and tried to fob me off into paying it... not pleasant. The person manning reception appeared over worked.]
