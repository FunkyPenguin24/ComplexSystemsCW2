[108070618273391768605,100637413749692096178,I don't know about you but, we are always looking for good sushi. We have found the best. Being from San Diego, we more than enough selection but nothing has compared to this. Excellent drinks, service (Michael) was superior and, as I said, the sushi was beyond good. Thank you to the entire staff: hostess, waiter and sushi chefs for an amazing last night dinner on Kauai. We will be back next trip.]
