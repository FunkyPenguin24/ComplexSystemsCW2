[105882163333344321796,100579111491221711967,I first went to Shape Plus because I didn’t fit into my bridesmaids dress for my brother’s wedding that was in a month and I had heard the radio commercials with Jess saying “We do amazing!” and I knew I was going to need it! So I went in told them my goal and we went to work and sure enough after about a month the dress fit again! I signed up for 9 weeks so after I got back from the wedding I decided I wanted to loose even more weight, it was addictive. Not only did I lose a total of 15 pounds working out at Shape Plus but I developed a love and an addiction to fitness. I had been over weight my whole life and never thought I was athletic or capable of doing all of those things athletic people do but the people at shape plus showed me otherwise. They really push you but most importantly they really care about YOU, your wellbeing and getting you to your goals. With them I ran my first mile! I lifted more weights then I could imagine! I learned what a healthy diet was, not just eating the right thing but WHEN to eat. I loved my time with Shape Plus and recommend them to everyone!]
