[111417983259992243769,100028318992495763026,Competent, honest service department. Friendly, not overly pressuring sales team. I totaled my beloved 2007 FJ, originally purchased at Boulder Toyota in September of 2012. I called up the sales team at BT again and told them about my situation and my desire to find the same truck to replace it with. Within two days they had the exact same vehicle shipped in from another Larry H. Miller location in Colorado Springs. Important note -- If you are financing a vehicle, be sure to ask the sales team about getting GAP coverage. I am lucky that I paid the extra bit to have it on my first truck, it ended up saving me over $4500 net when my insurance payout didn't completely cover the outstanding balance of my loan. Think of it as a very worthwhile insurance policy against the value of your vehicle. Boulder Toyota has done all the scheduled maintenance on both of the trucks I've had, and I have never been anything but satisfied with their professionalism, scheduling flexibility, and quality of service.]
