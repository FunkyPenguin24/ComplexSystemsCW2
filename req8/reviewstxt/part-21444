Third. Location by the freeway is convenient but very loud. Louder than average for a hotel near a freeway. The flyover interchange is eye level with our fifth floor room. Woken up at 3:30am by what sounded like a jackhammer in our wall. Called front desk, they said they'd send up a security guard. 30 minutes and two calls later, the security guard arrives and confirms we have an intolerably loud noise from inside the wall, not caused by the room next door (unoccupied). Asked front desk if she could move us to a different room. She said 'no, we're all full'. She then stated she would double check and call me back. She did not call back. The security guard came back to the room about 10 minutes later with keys for a different room. Surprise, not as sold out as stated. Got to our new room at 4:30am, the key cards don't unlock the door. Call down to the front desk, she says she'll be right up. Security guard show up, let's us into the room. This was the only night of the past year where I actually needed a great nights sleep and no stress. Glad we got that taken care of, Crowne Plaza. Do yourselves a favor. One, don't pay their normal rate online, it's a joke. Two, it's not worth the hotwire price of $75/night, even without our nightmare noise issues. Just don't stay here, period.]
