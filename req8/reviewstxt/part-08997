[118167877969658049964,100638090405367163396,When I was stationed in Germany having issues with my 2008 535i BMW that I had purchased there, I took it to BMW where they diagnosed the problem and told me that I needed to replace all of the fuel injectors at a cost of 1200 euros. I shipped my vehicle back to Orlando and took it in for repair at the local BMW dealership. They diagnosed it as the fuel pump and replaced it. The issues with my car continued. Hesitation, power, and starting issues. Through the recommendation of a good friend I brought the car in to Auto World Atlantic. They quickly diagnosed the issue, and at a cost of under $500 they left me with my BMW running like new. Having it less that 1 day had me back on the road. To this day I have not had any issues with my car. I know that they are the European car experts in Orlando. Highly recommended!]
