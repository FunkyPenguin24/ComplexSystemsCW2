[112336639912729932266,101038796311336880419,It's been a while since I last stayed at the White Hart, however I have previously stayed there many times whilst on business in the area. I have always found the staff and management to be excellent hosts, and the resources of the inn to be considerably better than most other inns of this type. The rooms are warm and comfortable, and the food offered well and truly suited my individual needs and preferences. This was especially important as I usually worked inhospitable hours, and have needed to entertain influential clients on a number of occasions. It is my hope that I can return at some point, not on business, but with my family, something that I am looking forward to.]
