[100546816504252881677,100713209529889980866,Gary and Mike came out to my home to do a "12 Month Warranty" inspection just to make sure that I didn't get stuck with paying any "builders errors" before the warranty expired. I had no clue what to look for. They did a fantastic job, very thorough, spent a few hours here, and gave me the peace of mind knowing everything was A-OK! Their report was very detailed and easy to read! I'd highly recommend ANYONE from the Home Inspection Man team!]
