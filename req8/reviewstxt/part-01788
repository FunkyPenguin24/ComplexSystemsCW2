At no time have they even really looked at my items before telling me no they don't need them. I try only because they happen to be right down the street so they're convenient. Funny thing though, I can walk straight from them and their NO to a yes with a smile anywhere else I go. Maybe it's just me. Maybe you have to know someone. IDK]
