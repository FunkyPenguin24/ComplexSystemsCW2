[106879076476418785888,100364538626826205612,When our beloved golden retriever collapsed from his cancer, I called Armadale. They had warned me to watch for this. The vet and receptionist remembered that I was pregnant, and they sent a technician to my house with a sling. The tech crawled under our porch and carried Dante to the car for me. My husband joined me at the vet's office to bade a final farewell to our dear friend of many years. After the vet gave the first injection, Dante raised his head to lick her nose as if to thank her for all the amazing care over the years before he breathed his last. It's never easy to say goodbye to a member of the family, but Armadale made it bearable. I most highly recommend them to anyone who loves an animal.]
