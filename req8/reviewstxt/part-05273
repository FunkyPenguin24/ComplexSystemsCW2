[102997174505942751175,100439383173455570782,When I first saw their work on my truck, I was literally speechless! I recently purchased a new Dodge Ram and not long after I bought it, I found a large dent/ crease in the passenger rear door. I was told by three or four different automotive professionals that the dent would need to be repaired by a body shop because it was damaged beyond the possibility of paintless dent repair. I was referred to New Visions by a friend who assured me that they could definitely repair it without bodywork, and I have to say I was skeptical, but I figured I'd at least try it in effort to avoid having bondo & paint work done on my new truck. I was AMAZED that Brian was able to completely remove the dent & crease in my truck. I honestly would have been happy even if there was still a small sign of the crease, but when he finished, I couldn't even find where the dent or crease was originally located on the door. He is a master at his trade to say the least!! I will keep New Visions in my contact list for all future dent work, and I will recommend them to anyone and everyone I come across who needs dent work. Thank you, New Visions! Customer for life, James M. Dallas, TX]
