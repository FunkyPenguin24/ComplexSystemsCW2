[109141315758935897273,100710022171329946697,I'm from Brisbane, but I travel to Melbourne several times a year and the Doot is a pretty regular stop off. The food here is great - a cut above other pubs without being any more expensive. You can rely on getting a delicious risotto or perfectly cooked steak, in generous portions too. They serve good beers from the tap! I know Melbournians love their Carlton Draft, but it's refreshing to have something else on offer too. They have some craft beers and quality internationals.... I'm a beer lover, so I think that might be why I prefer the Doot to other Melbourne pubs. It's a really welcoming place, which is pretty important for a solo interstate traveller. I put it down to the uber-friendly staff and quirky, but comfy fit-out. I've not stuck around for the full party / club Friday or Saturday nights yet, but I'm probably too old for that anyway. I do want to check it out one day (my friends and colleagues have all recommended it) but for now I'm well happy with the place for good beer and great food.]
