[104572239326307239817,100065486498623715506,I love this studio. Practically next door to my apartment, it's convenient, everyone is friendly, and the prices are so affordable--especially for grad students like me. Clarissa's Saturday afternoon class is great. The studio does a lot for the community as well, and that is evident in their approach to yoga.]
