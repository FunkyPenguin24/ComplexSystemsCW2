[100876555775112096831,100394764164929012368,I took my mother there to get a new pair of eyeglasses. She had an eye exam done and found that she needed a stronger prescription than the one she already had. They filled the prescription for her and she picked out a nice pair of Versace frames as well - everything was done in-house and there was no work needed on our part to get any of it done, that's the kind of service I'm looking for. If you need to get contacts or glasses, Eye Supply has a great in-house service - ask for Mark, he'll take care of you.]
