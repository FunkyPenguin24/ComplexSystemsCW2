[102468649322622147171,100407094800494478339,I personally love going to Cathay Inn the staff are friendly, the service is great and the food is delicious! I always order the wor gauge mein, cayuk, lemon chicken and the crispy gauge mein with small bowl rice which is a lot but so worth treating your self and ohana atleast once a month. BARTELS ohana]
