[114615429250369850565,100056229525605885341,I'm so sick and tired of being taken advantage of for a service. I cringe more waiting to hear a quote on a car repair than I do waiting to hear back from my doctor. After going to multiple places (5 including my car dealer) and being quoted upwards of $1500 for a muffler job I took my car into these guys and had my muffler done for around $500 bucks. I've been there 3 times now and have never felt like I was being taken advantage of. These guys are speedy/friendly/helpful and most of all HONEST. Do yourself a favor and stop in. They have a K-Cup station, a nice size T.V, comfy seats, and their bathroom is (no joke) cleaner than mine.]
