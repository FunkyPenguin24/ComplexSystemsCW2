[114941870518666326267,100695845179034392775,You have to go in with the right expectations -- it's a diner, folks! The insanely varied menu is part of the appeal. We love to come here with our finicky boys, who always eat a cheeseburger and fries, which look and taste the way they expect them to, yet my husband and I have lots of options to choose from. Maybe burgers, maybe salads, omelets, whatever. The variety is especially nice because we don't get tired of coming here like we do if we've been to an Italian/Sushi/Thai/Whatever restaurant too many times in a row. The Big View Diner is DEFINITELY kid-friendly, and we have always received outstanding service. Desserts are yummy, too -- so sometimes we just go for pie or ice cream sundaes.]
