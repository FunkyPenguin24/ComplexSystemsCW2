[103458985997462625020,100523361780351049845,Sapor is a diamond in the rough. It is completely unassuming, sitting on a hill off Washington Ave. The dining room is dimly lit -- perfect for a romantic night out. The menu is diverse, with a ban mi sandwich, falafel salad, traditional burger+fries & ethiopian stew listed side by side. Definitely something for everyone. We tried the brussel sprouts appetizer (buttery goodness), the falafel salad (by far the healthiest way to eat falafel...and the falafel had some great flavor) and the pancetta burger with fried egg and lemon+herb fries (delicious). For dessert we went with the molten chocolate cake with mint whipped cream -- it tasted like a thin mint...a high end thin mint. The specialty drinks (we tried the North Loop) was well crafted. Our server was really great, going above & beyond to make our date night special. I'm looking forward to going back because there are so many good items on the menu -- and also for their small chocolates that they serve when they bring the check. Made in house, melt in your mouth...can't stop thinking about them!]
