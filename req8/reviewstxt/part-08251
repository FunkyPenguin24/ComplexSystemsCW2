[115857536665886625972,100601013544776463917,My entire experience with these people has been disastrous. My original loan originator seemed to work hard to get me into the right loan product. He then suggested that I go from a conventional loan (my existing loan) to an FHA loan which required private mortgage insurance. At the incredibly low rate he offered me, I would still be ahead even with the PMI fee. I ok'd this, sent him all of my documentation and then heard nothing. For days. Turned out he'd been fired. When I finally got to the bottom of that, I was sent on to the new originator who reviewed my information and told me to proceed with the FHA. Today, I get a call from the loan processor. She informs me that my condo isn't an FHA approved property. But, they already yoinked the $450 for the appraisal from my bank account. I am not amused. One would have thought they would have conducted due diligence about my condo before offering me the loan. Is this bait and switch, or pure incompetence? I've again called the manager, as well as the processor and the second originator, but no one is answering the phone. All I want is my money back. I am thoroughly disgusted.]
