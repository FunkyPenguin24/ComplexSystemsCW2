[113733107062668119150,100824713990843539136,Came to stay here after we had a tree fall on our house. Made reservations on the phone and indicated we would be staying for multiple days. My pregnant wife with three children in tow arrived before I could get out of school. Multiple hours before I could arrive she was turned away by the desk lady and denied entry into our room because I had the debit card. I had already payed for the room. With no where to go and no money on her they made her sit and wait for me to arrive. This is terrible service and I will never go here again. The young girl behind the counter had no concept of 'customer service' and in no way went out of her way to accomodate us and our situation. Facilities were ok. Service, not so much. Would not recommend staying here.]
