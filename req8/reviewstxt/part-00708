[105156060233538894702,100196357977255607187,Everything was fast and well done. Rick was cool and easy to deal with. My band looked all over for people to do our merch and we decided to get rick to do our stickers because of the price. Lets just say our bands stickers weren't the ones rubbing off of car windows like other local bands and he fit a sticker to what we need not just some cookie cutter selection. I highly suggest ace high printing, they've never let us down.]
