[114170993091379545012,101156201832201099002,Happy to have my iPhone screen fixed in 45 minutes after smashing it on a sunday late afternoon. Not so happy to find that it now had many problems. Constantly rebooted itself, battery did not read correct levels and was barely able to function because of the rebooting. Sent it with repair... after 2 1/2 weeks almost they sent it back saying that i would have to restore to factory settings because a recent upgrade was most likely the problem. They also said that they would let me restore settings so i could back up all the contents. Turned on the phone today to find that all my photos, apps and contacts had already been deleted. Also found that problem STILL happened after resetting through phone. Now having to go through a three hour process on iTunes which i'm not even sure will fix it..... Very sad...]
