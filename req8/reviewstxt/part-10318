[102699336165397630027,100711195158962337737,Had a great time! Staff were friendly and helpful. I tried the long black course and it was really hard (I'm a somewhat lanky 19 year old male) but was a great challenge. Definitely worth a visit, but don't make the mistake of thinking only the hard courses are fun, the others are very relaxing.]
