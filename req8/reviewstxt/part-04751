[110347512939732489155,100410964303020115699,Been going here for 28 years (my whole life). As of today I will no longer be going to this rinky-dink, MONEY grubbing establishment. The facilities have not been upgraded since I have been going there as a small child. Schedule an appt... and expect to be seen 45min to 1hour after that appointment time. Pretty much their standard for the last 5+ years. After your wait, Dr. Smith or Dr. Petrey will spend all of 10min attending to your needs. Express concern or dissatisfaction over their proposed treatment, prescriptions, etc. and they will ignore you. If you come to them with legitimate problems they are not afraid to brush them off and not directly address your needs. When push comes to shove... they will just whip out the pad and pen and start writing you 3 unnecessary prescriptions for something as simple as a cough (none of which will be helpful). Shuffle you out of there... CLEARLY their time is more important/valuable than yours... and pay the piper at the door. This is pretty damn pathetic given I have literally... L I T E R A L L Y come here from birth until age 28... and seen the same Dr the whole time... and I am willing to walk away. Save yourself some time and trust my experience: ANYWHERE is better than here.]
