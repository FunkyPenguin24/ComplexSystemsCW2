[107031190258871915615,100357378525669790424,We have had nothing but great experiences with Tom Wood. From the initial purchase (with three young children, this is no easy task), to the vehicle orientation, and to the follow up service, my experiences have been great! We live over an hour away from this location, but the drive is worth it. When I bring in my 2013 Pathfinder for maintenance, they do an entire check on the car, fix a few bugs that may have popped up, and recognize me by face/name each time I'm there. I felt like I was working with friends, and not JUST a customer. I also decided to order new floor mats for my car. I was willing to place the order and pick them up another time, but they had them already in stock! And the offered me the online discount I had received when I purchased the car a few months before. Talk about service...I was thrilled! I expect my vehicle will last a long time, but when it's time to swap it for a new car, you can bet it will be a Nissan, and it will come from Tom Wood.]
