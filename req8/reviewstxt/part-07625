[113352004864247933639,100566528900590028589,I'm not typically a "fast-food" guy, especially as of late while attempting to diet. Stopped in this morning (3/26/14) @ the McNeil location (Store#34) and requested a special menu item and they were quick to comply with my request (keeping it low carb). I also requested one of your Premium Roast Coffees with a splash of Caramel, 2 creams/2 sugars which I must say beats out the famed Dunkin Donuts coffee by far. My burrito was finished and a lovely Angela brought it out to me while another kind young lad finished & delivered my coffee right behind her. Exceptional customer service & employees were gentle on the eyes with bright smiles. Keep it up I'll definitely be back on "cheat days". Stall# 19A, Ticket# 13 7:54AM]
