[110407789250634526265,100965745305567022515,I'm been banking with Moody Bank for a number of years now, and they've always treated me right. I like the fact that they aren't a big national chain but a local bank. The people are always friendly and eager to help. In a pinch they will do their best to help you out as they did for me on a couple of occasions, and for that I'm a repeat customer for as long as I live in the air and they continue to exist.]
