[102433063197989312192,100583921669934843415,My new wife and I got married there on 2/22/2014. Let me tell you, these guys are the real deal! Leading up to the wedding, we really didn't know what to expect. There was a lot going on. Arnaldo's made it very easy and low stress. Everything went as planned and I don't think we could have asked for a better venue. Food was delicious! Usually when you go to a wedding, it is pretty bland food. We had about 200 people @ the reception and we didn't want the "traditional" wedding food. So, food stations was our best bet. LET ME TELL YOU, not one person complained about the food! Actually, everyone said it was very good, rich and fun! No food was cold, and the wait staff was helping out like no other. The GM was even there navigating everything and working with the staff! All in all, we are extremely happy and if we ever need to do anything again, we will defiantly call Arnaldo's first! Thanks again guys, you guys are AWESOME!!! Best, Evan and Briana]
