[102612143067945021583,100959127205699427180,My friends and I went to Thrillvania Thrill Park last Saturday. It was a blast we were a bunch of scared girls screaming at every little thing. They have these characters roaming all over the park it is so creepy and scary. The clown 3D house was so scary one of my friends is afraid of clowns I thought she was going to make me fall she was so close to me hiding her face in my back. The Manor was so creepy, ghouls and wolves were everywhere. I love the house on the hill the most. It was complete darkness with a tiny glow stick which of coarse we lost. Creatures would move by you and the earth was moving beneath my feet. It was crazy cool!!! We spent the entire night out there is was a night to remember. Thanks Thrillvania for showing us girls a great time!!!]
