[117651696428509752983,100643736715079580353,Since moving to Miami not too long ago, I had not yet found doctors to help in whatever scenario may arise. I had a potentially serious sports-related eye injury and needed to find somewhere to go quickly. I read the reviews for Dr. Gould, and decided to see if the office could schedule me immediately. The office was so concerned about my health that they ensured I rushed over to get checked out, squeezing me in between patients immediately. Dr. Gould was thorough and friendly, even though she didn't have much time to see me. Everyone in the office was super friendly, and I actually enjoyed hanging out there. Very good experience, and I would definitely recommend visiting Dr. Gould!]
