[113206211965220181938,100914780779236505664,My experience with CRI has been extremely positive. My 6 month old puppy goes to camp 4 to 5 days a week and cannot wait to get into the building. Prior to taking my dog to the facility, I arranged a tour of the building (which the staff was happy to do) and I had all my questions answered. CRI's web site explains that certain breeds of dogs are not accepted for insurance purposes, however CRI does not have a blanket policy of excluding "mixes." My dog is a shelter rescue and a mix of many things. The staff has always been very friendly with me and my dog runs to them with excitement when they come out of the door to get him. I am grateful that I have found somewhere I can trust to leave our family dog while we are at work.]
