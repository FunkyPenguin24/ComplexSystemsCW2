[106421238828759644248,100255875555475656491,I am the third person from my family to have passed my driving test with Utah. I would recommend anyone that is looking to pass the driving test to contact elliottss chool of motoring. Utah is a really good teacher, he was encouraging and determent to get me to pass. As someone that did not even dream about ever driving a car he boosted my confidence and made me feel comfortable behind the wheel.]
