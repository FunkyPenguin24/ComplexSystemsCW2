[116280899682912760988,100481985740473963983,Just bought a Ford F-150 from AutoNation Ford of Bradenton. Can not say enough about how kind and helpful Tim Betts was from the greeting on the lot, the test drive to answering of all our questions. Tim was very easy to talk to and I never felt any pressure during the whole transaction. After the deal, Tim does a Great job of following up to make sure all is going well with your new auto. All the staff was very friendly. If your looking for a new auto give Tim a call. Thanks again!!!]
