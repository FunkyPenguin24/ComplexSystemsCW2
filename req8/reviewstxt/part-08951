[110341103643980277119,100635650486700020020,Took the wife there today for lunch. Every bit as good as last time we were there. Lunch menu runs through 3pm with most expensive plate at $7.25. I judge TexMex by the cheese enchiladas and Rosarios has the best cheese enchiladas in town. Add a margarita on the rocks. They're excellent. Go! Enjoy!]
