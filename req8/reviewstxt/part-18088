[110551440293386292774,101134096955918999531,I am admittedly a little bit of a pain when it comes to pictures of me (picky, neurotic, take your pick.) Julie was so sweet and patient, plus when it came down the the final picks, she helped so much and was able to take some of the best photos of me ever! I did a bridal shoot with her and she took my professional headshot and I will never even consider going for anyone else but Julie! She has a creative vision that is unlike anyone else's and I have seen her work well with any kind of subject. Julie has earned my highest recommendation! (And for the record, she makes a really good chicken parmesean too!)]
