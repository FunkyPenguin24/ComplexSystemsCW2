[112479189533948149997,101119453118023030280,I sent an older man there multiple times to have documents PRINTED- then signed-then EMAILED back to me. He does not speak very clear English, but is a very quick learner (having been a chemist and electrical engineer.) The staff took advantage of him. They charged him $40 to scan in 19 pages and then asked him to pay another $50 to FAX the documents. He has paid over $300 dollars at that location to send simple documents to me. I had NO idea that they had been doing this to him, When I called they said it was just easier because they were busy and under-staffed. I have been a Fed-Ex customer for a long time. I recommend Fed-Ex to my clients who do not have home scanners and computers or that are not internet proficient- most of them are elderly. I sell homes, the people that I recommend are on strict time frames they have to meet, they get out of work and must go to Fed-Ex after normal business hours to meet deadlines or they will not get their homes. FED-EX took advantage of this and I will never again send anyone there. They should be ashamed to have such opportunistic employees; I can only imagine what company policy directs this type of behavior.]
