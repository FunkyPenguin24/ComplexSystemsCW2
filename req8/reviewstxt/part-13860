[101979343482571003558,100903358151002845404,I hired Alexander Heating and Air Conditioning Service and they arrived on time, were respectful of my property, time, and the price was excellent! Since my unit had not been serviced in a couple of years, I expected them to find something that was going to cost me a great deal of money. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised when it only needed a low cost capacitor. Even though they did not have the lower cost one in their truck, they put in the higher priced one in case I needed to use the air conditioning before I could find time to have them return with the lower priced one. When they returned, there wasn't even an additional charge for switching out the part and the return visit. Highly recommend them!]
