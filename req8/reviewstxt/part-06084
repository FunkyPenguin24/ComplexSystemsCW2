[104753541419217275860,100481818344673376435,This is the only place I will eat fast food. I am a big fan of Chipotle, but I also have to say that compared to other locations, and compared to when it opened, Roanoke skimps on the portion sizes. It used to happen infrequently, but lately portion sizes have declined at this location. I get the same thing everywhere I go: a bowl with only double meat, salsa, guacamole, and lettuce. That's it. If I'm paying $1.80 for guac, don't scrape most of it off of the spoon. If I ask for double meat, and you are charging me for it, don't make each portion smaller so I end up with 1.5x meat. I'm saving the place money on toppings as it is.]
