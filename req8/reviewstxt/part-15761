[100011203244721549281,101007895398812491183,Excellent service from the front desk, kid had red hair, I forgot his name but he was the most polite and helpful person I have encountered in my many travels, and I do travel alot. The room was clean, newspapers available, cost was about $70 for two beds, breakfast was gravy, fruit, yogart, cereal, bread, waffles, muffins and more. I liked my stay there and I will be coming back!! And, it was just sold by LaQuinta to Brooks Inn.. I dont' know what kind of effect that will have on quality for the future.]
