[110770254165250926391,100820666382476902745,The staff at Fitness 19 in Parma has been excellent. I just recently became a member and I got a great deal on my membership and immensely enjoy working out there. I live nearby in the neighborhood, so it is very convenient as the location is accessible from many different neighborhoods on the east side of Parma. I've met folks that come over from adjacent communities, Seven Hills, and Independence. What makes this gym so great is the diversity of people that come in on a regular basis and the quality of the staff which is very helpful and will give you tips and tricks on improving the quality of your workout. I highly recommend getting a membership there and enjoying the benefits of this club.]
