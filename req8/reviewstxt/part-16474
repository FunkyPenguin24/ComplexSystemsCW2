[101389818838752538784,101045680318472341906,Stayed here for a get-away weekend. Always worry about how a hotel will be when you have no references. I checked out several hotel reviews and this hotel was the only one that didn't have any bad ones! I now see why!! It is beautiful, well kept, and quiet. The King bed was SUPER comfortable and the price was well worth it! I would stay here again if I am ever in town or passing through.]
