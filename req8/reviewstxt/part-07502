[111305321455579984550,100560877780138585741,Le Voyeur is a restaurant unlike any I've ever been to. The have so many options for vegetarians, vegans and omnivores alike. Always a different experience, interesting music, interesting wait staff, and absolutely amazing food until all hours of the night. As for the people saying it smells or is dirty are full of it. Its definitely got character. But I've never observed it to be unhygienic or smelly. Also garlic fries are a must!]
