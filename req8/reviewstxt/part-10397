[100297927155160146184,100715111889361444746,You've heard it before, about every top Thai restaurant: "this is the most authentic Thai food; so close to what they have in Thailand". You've also heard the detractors "Rubbish, you must come to 'x' to experience true Thai food". Unfortunately neither is true, you will not (or very rarely) find authentic Thai food outside of Thailand let alone Sydney. Having said that, this does not preclude a restaurant from serving Thai that is a cut above the rest both in taste and quality and that's exactly what Home Thai does. You'll wait a long time and fight many contestants for the privilege of eating here but it'll be worth it for while you may leave a bit heavier, your pocket won't have lost a proportional amount of weight. So no, you won't get 'authentic' Thai food but you will get some of Sydney's best for the price in an atmosphere at least that is strangely somewhat reminiscent of Thailand. Put simply, you want good Thai? Come here.]
