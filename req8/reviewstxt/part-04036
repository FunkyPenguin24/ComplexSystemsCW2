They assisted me with selecting the proper vehicle with payments I could afford and getting the proper financial assistance along with guidance throughout the purchasing ordeal. Very understanding and honest personnel to help walk me through the ordeal. Great selection of vehicles and affordable prices giving me the confidence to proceed with the purchase and not regret my decisions. I will be purchasing all my vehicles from this point on due to the assistance given at a time when your very vulnerable due to the huge commitment of buying a new vehicle can be. Great service throughout the purchase and speedy delivery, Friendly Personnel from the general manager assistance, financial division guidance and of Course sales staff (Hector Maldonado) making sure I was satisfied before I left and weeks after. You will not regret working with Mid County Dodge. Sincerely, Freddie Greer]
