[100253646105871952121,101118657273045272421,Best pub in Cardiff by a mile. Friendly staff, great food and a brilliant place to watch the footy. The pub has 'zoned' audio so you can have a chat over a pint without having to shout, beer garden has a big screen for the smokers as well, you will have to look hard to beat this pub.]
