[105654400025941484745,100084757436290743329,The House of Blues just started using Fastsigns about a year ago. They have created signs and logos for us that include our trademark burning heart symbol to signs for our marquee for Carlos Santana. They have always met the time line needed for each project and take a job on for us as if they own it. The staff is knowledgable in all facets of advertisment and sign making. Miriam has been a great help with all of the pieces we have purchased. The only bad thing is that I didnt start using Fastsigns/75 a long time ago. I recommend that you take your next project, be it big or small to them and you will see what they can do.]
