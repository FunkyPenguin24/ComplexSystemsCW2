[106295656625909051568,100501401429951111008,Joe's Farm Grill has good food, a relaxing "down-to-earth" home-style atmosphere. If you have a large family, prepare to spend big bucks! Never seems to have any group or family deals. Like the idea of supporting local farms and small business, but this is definitely more of a trendy fast food/diner style restaurant. If you consider yourself a HIPSTER, then you will fit right in at this place.]
