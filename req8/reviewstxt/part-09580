As an ex-car saleseman myself, I know exactly who I *don't* like dealing with. Those guys that try to trick you into thinking you are getting the best deal. Dwayne laid it all on the line, he was very straight forward with me and told me the best possible deal I could get. I ended up buying a car from another dealer, but out of the half a dozen salespersons that I worked with across all the dealers, Dwayne was the best. Also, he's ridiculously good looking. If I know anybody who is looking for a Honda/VW/Audi/Porsche, I'm sending them directly to Dwayne!]
