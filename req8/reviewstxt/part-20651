[108725334983857655279,100093701598850569742,Stopped here after dinner on a Saturday night to have a beer at the bar and pick up some new bottles to take home. The thing about this beer shop that is different from others I've been to (Tasty, Beer Study, Bottle Revolution, etc) is that the bar area is much larger - it is the size of bar you'd see in a restaurant. That means that there is less room for racks of bottled beer for sale. The selection of bottled beer was nicely organized and had some great option for creating a sample pack, like I was doing. They had a local section with a good amount of local breweries. The place was packed to the brim with bottles - even a little room in the back. There weren't as many beers on tap as I had expected for a bar that size. We had the Duck Rabbit Hoppy Bunny since we hadn't tried it before. I think they had about 7 beers on tap and I wish they had had a few more. They also served wine. I might have ordered a second beer but they were $7 a piece! The bet part of this beer shop is the lounge area - couches and tables for people to sit. At 8pm on a Saturday night we were able to get a seat easily. We will definitely be back.]
