[100670476163327636757,100346239059550416021,These guys are great!! I was helped by the manager, Brett, and two other guys They were amazing. Got everything set up for me and even went the extra mile to call me a couple if Times after to make sure everything was working out. This is the one by MRS. Fields, its a corporate store, there's another inside the mall by JMR, they are an authorized dealer and screwed up my plan and added things they shouldn't have. Beware of authorized dealers.]
