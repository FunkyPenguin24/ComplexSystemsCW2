[105577317988978263719,100993275367592800946,We had a terrific experience renting from King Kong Party Rentals. We selected the Junior Funhouse Dual Slide Moonwalk with POOL and absolutely loved it. My 3 year old and her friends loved jumping around in the moonwalk, climbing the ladder, and then sliding down into the water pool. The dad's also loved it, as we would jump up to the top of the slide and enjoy and head-first slide into the pool. King Kong Party Rentals is organized and accurately delivers the product you want on-time. I also found them to be very much price competitive. Great experience and we have now selected them for multiple birthday parties.]
