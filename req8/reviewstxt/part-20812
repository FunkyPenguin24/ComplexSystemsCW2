[103954470524891106638,100102868305548076351,My experience with Honda of Tenafly was outstanding. Herbie Rosario knew what I wanted, had the car waiting for me to buy with all my request, and gave me all the options I had in order to attain my new Honda Accord. Because of Honda of Tenafly having a great relationship with USAA (military members) I choose this dealership and they most certainly lived up to their name and outstanding customer service. There was no hassle or stress during my process, just honest straight foward progress from my dealer Herbie Rosario. I recommend anyone and everyone to come here to buy their Honda especially military service memebers. They truly take care of you as if you were family and I will forever be loyal to them because of that. Thank You Honda of Tenafly and Thank You Herbie Rosario! LT Castro]
