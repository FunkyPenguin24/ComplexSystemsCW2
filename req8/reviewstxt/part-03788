So I said hello how are you and the hostess rudely said "alright" and carried on. Another younger girl took our order. The food came out in a family size dish and we had to ask for individual plates. No one ever came by to ask if we needed anything the entire time we were there. A white family walked in and was welcomed with a friendly greeting and a smile from the same rude hostess. As we left, no one said thanks for coming or even goodbye. We felt very uncomfortable and will not be returning. The food was average. They need to hire people who aren't racist and we MIGHT go back.]
