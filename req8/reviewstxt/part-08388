[114426068484461679652,100608414425136184080,I was very pleased with my first impression from a phone conversation when I called to set up an estimate for a new heat pump and air conditioner. The secretary was very personable and efficient. I was blown away by Brian, the the technician who originally came to my house. He was very informative, friendly and patient while explaining the how AC and heating work and showing me all of my options. He also let me borrow a portable AC until installation day. I decided to purchase a new system because I felt sure that I could depend on and trust this company. They arrived bright and early the day they had scheduled and worked non-stop to get us up and running. They were very professional and helpful throught the whole process and I will use them for any other issues in the future.]
