[101402944988583420999,100459797747789193858,This week, I had an appointment for crown work on THREE molars. Normally, this is a 2-3 hour appointment. Not only did Dr. Brown and her team do a wonderful job on my teeth - they accommodated my tight work schedule and had me out in short order and to my job on time. I never felt any pain and Dr. Brown made absolutely sure I was comfortable. This team is awesome!]
