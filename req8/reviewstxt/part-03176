[112388774899525696515,100322939845747890914,Terrible customer service, these guys have little to no motivation, technical know-how, or people skills. I was given in over inflated estimate for a strut replacement, and was given a copy with no explaination of the form, the cost, or the math. When I asked for the run-down, the service gentleman, answered the phone and said he could not pull up a copy of the estimate. Not only that, he had the gall to tell me if I wanted the total I would have to add it up myself, and do the math myself without listing any of the numbers and totals on the form. Then rudely dismissed me. BTW, if this is read by anyone in power, his name is Larry...get rid of him before he damages what little reputation you have left. You have just lost a customer for life, and will gladly pay more at another shop to never have to set foot in your store again.]
