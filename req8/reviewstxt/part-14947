[101758541606976213870,100964131759942851646,I went in to get a nail removed from a tire and have it fixed before getting more damaged. Not only did they do the work for free as the previous owner of the vehicle had purchased tires from a kal tire, but they also did a free and honest inspection of the vehicle for me, checking up and topping off my fluids and letting me know where things that require regular maintenance were at. I'll definitely be returning when needed.]
