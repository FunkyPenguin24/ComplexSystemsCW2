[115275556410317152507,100175306709573121825,The apartments look great, but I could hear our neighbor snoring every night. Every conversation, dog barking, couples fighting, and person snoring can be heard through the walls. The neighbors are all loud, and the management doesn’t care to fix anything. Our hot water heater went out 4 times in one week, because instead of figuring out the problem they kept throwing spare parts at it until something “took.” In addition to this, the already high rent has a 15% price spike every year. The cherry on top? We moved out July 31st and they reported us to a debt collection agency (August 13th): after 14 days!!! We’ve never missed rent, or paid late, or given then any reason to report us. Normally, debt collectors report you immediately to your credit bureau and it goes onto your rental history. Luckily this agency doesn’t report it to our credit history or rental history because they told us that: Holland Residential (Overlook’s rental agency) has a history of reporting tenants abnormally fast. My husband and I are appalled. We’re in our mid 20’s, just bought our first home, have no debt, great credit history, and stable careers – but made the unfortunate mistake of moving into their apartment complex. We’re paying $140 in cleaning fees, even after meticulously cleaning the apartment all day. We could not be happier to be moving out! Whatever you do, do not live there. Yes, the location is great, but it is not worth it. There are lots of other apartments close by, choose any – they’ll be better than the Overlook at Lakemont!]
