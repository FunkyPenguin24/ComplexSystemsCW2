[114074751160178366193,100487037796895138152,When I bought my first property at 20, I used Mortgage Success to help me navigate through the seemingly scary process of securing a mortgage. Roberta and Tara were always there when I needed them and educated me along the way. I greatly appreciated their attention to detail and wide-range of experience with many different lenders. When the time came for me to renew, Mortgage Success was there to help me again in renegotiating my amortization and rate. I don't think I will ever get a mortgage directly from a bank when I know already that Roberta and Tara will search high and low to get me the best rate possible.]
