[116883193229015634657,100170153970193633339,I've trained in martial arts for many years in different disciplines and under different instructors. There are schools out there that have become mainly a business with less emphasis on the development of the individual student. There are schools that will promote students even though the student has not shown proficiency or has not earned the promotion. Salvosa BJJ is most assuredly not one of them. For those searching for an instructor who genuinely cares about the development and progression of each student and will gladly give individual attention, Professor Salvosa is definitely one such instructor. For those looking for a place to train where emphasis is given to growing as a team and each success is earned, Salvosa BJJ is certainly an academy to consider.]
