[100518466577979213845,100206998579652673232,Russell, you are an idiot... The bible has punishments for mixing textiles, and touching the skin of a dead animal... At LEAST read the Bible before you go and spew hate. Read: Leviticus, and NOT just the self serving parts that adhere to your narrow, pig-ignorant low brow, inbred translation. You are what is wrong with Christianity, Jesus would actually hate you (he hated 2 things $$ changers and RELIGIOUS HYPOCRITES...) You fit into the second category.]
