[108044769263121407134,100729842990805060929,I love love this place. I like the fact that when I am craving Pho and I'm at the Outlets, I can come here. When I am in a hurry, I call ahead and get it to go. Spring rolls are amazing! So are the frozen mango desserts. I will confess that I've only had Vietnamese food at one other place, Pho Saigon in Oxnard. I loved it there and I love it here. I prefer the atmosphere at Basil and Mint though. More room to relax and have a nice meal on a date night with my wife. We got to meet the owner/chef one night when she came out to the dining room while we were eating and talked to us for a bit to see how we liked the meal. She was so friendly and it was neat to hear the story of why she started the restaurant. Her Vietnamese accent was a bit thick so it was a little hard for me to understand her but I think we got the gist of it. FYI, the restaurant is tucked away in the left corner of the plaza. Get the House Noodle Soup and add lots of lemon... sooo good!]
