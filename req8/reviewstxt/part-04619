[118244740826179371286,100405408201883325576,Barnes has high quality products and helpful associates. I go there for pet supplies, so I can't comment to much on garden supplies. Their pet food selection is great and they are great at helping you find what you need. They have samples of most foods and will take food back if your pet won't eat it. Very nice, independent, local store.]
