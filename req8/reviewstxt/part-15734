[110997530413699621456,101006913790464888154,I've been going to the guys at Your Choice Inala for a few years now, both for tyres and car servicing and have no hesitation in recommending them to other car owners - in fact a number of my friends do go there and also recommend to others - which shows how consistent YCTM are in their commitment to service. Recently had a rather horrid noise emitting from my car so of course I called them. Brad Mullins took great care of me, identified the issues and did a temp fix so I could drive the car till parts turned up. Then gave me an excellent price on what would have been a disaster if ignored. This is a great team who go out of their way to ensure you and yours will be safe on the roads. I'm hitting the road for FNQ today and can only hope I find another company half as good as this team. Special thanks to Brad and all the team there :)]
