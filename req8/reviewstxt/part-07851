[106220092931861715872,100579969525618144105,The rear fender on my wife's 2011 Honda Accord Coupe got banged up pretty good, especially on the passenger side - hanging down on the ground with some further internal damage. The folks at Seidner's Collision were fantastic. We have Farmers Insurance and everything was taken care of, nearly effortlessly - even the towing - we didn't have to use our AAA. They have a beautiful shop, I've never seen better. And, they have a thorough understanding of customer service - Marie, the woman at the front desk is the greatest - takes care of every single detail. A company couldn't ask for someone better - seriously. The repairs were completed in a very reasonable time and we were able to pick up the Honda at 7:30 in the morning. The car looked perfect. No one could ever tell it had been damaged. Absolutely good as new - I'm not kidding. I am not associated in any way with Seidner's - this was our first visit. And, when body repairs are needed again there is no question in our mind where we'll take our vehicle. They're the best of the best in our book.]
