[102429769629492295121,100246354576644560084,Motel 6 is not my favorite chain, but this one is a gem. Everyone is friendly and the room and the grounds were spotless. Staff was out every morning sweeping the sidewalk, parking areas and planted areas for rude people's litter and cigarette butts. The room smelled great when we entered - and it didn't have that Just Disinfected smell either. I plan to stay there again. When you consider the reasonable price, it's even better.]
