[111864348633270278631,100339654910142505786,Numerous issues with Doctors,staff and billing. In regards to staff professionalism, on more than one occasion I witnessed the desk staff labeling interracial clients using acronyms such as DWA (Dad with Asian) MWB (Mom with Black), etc. On one of my first visits I requested that a specific test not be done since my insurance does not cover it, and the doctors' office charges an overly excessive fee for the service. The doctor states, not to worry that they will not charge the fee if it is not covered. Well of course it was not covered, and then the office refused to honor the doctor's word to us leaving us with a hefty fee. Subsequent visits also resulted in at least a tripling of the bill on top of the doctors office fee because they involved the simplest of tests such as pulse oximetry and use of their nebulizer (not the cost of the medicine) that honesty cost maybe $1, yet the office charges $40 per test/treatment leaving the patient with an outrageous bill that if I had known how hyperinflated their charges were, I would have never consented to these things that I could do at home. Note: A nebulizer from a medical supply store cost $30-$50. When confronted with the cost reality of their procedures, the billing office response is "we can charge whatever we want" . While true, shows that they have no regard for their patients, only the mighty dollar bill. Just about all insurance plans are including higher and higher deductibles, and the greed of this office comes directly out of your pocket. I have found a much more reputable practice that does not gouge their client base.]
