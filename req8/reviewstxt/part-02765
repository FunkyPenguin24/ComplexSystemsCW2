[111043987235039398596,100301459900857001802,I would have rated this hotel much higher because the room was nice and the people at the desk were lovely. The food was nice and it is in an awesome location. BUT I gave them my car to valet and when I got it back it was broken inside on the centre console. This was not broken when I gave them the car. Its sounds small but it turns out it will cost almost $600 to fix it. I am furious. The manager was rude and dismissive to the point of being offensive. Unbelievable.]
