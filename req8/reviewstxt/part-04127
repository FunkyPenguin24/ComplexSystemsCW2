[105375060996328241732,100377077031387309676,I got a deal from Capital One which was immensely specific, finding a car within their parameters was harder than finding Waldo or Carmen San Diego! I was losing hope until we tried Flow. Jason Ramsey, Jamie Leggett, and Steve Fuchs were phenomenal! They worked tirelessly to procure a deal for us! They didn't pressure us into anything just to get a sale! They actually listened to us as we talk about our budget & plans and they really came through! They really exceeded my expectations and they demonstrated excellent customer service! Further, they kept us laughing throughout the strenuous process! If you or anyone you know is in or around Greensboro and looking for a car, send them to Flow Volkswagen of Greensboro and ask for Jason Ramsey... make sure you tell him that Shane & Princess sent you!]
