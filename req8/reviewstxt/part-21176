[103313147425317560388,100121859895492425581,I have been going to Aspen for the past 4 years and they have always treated me with kindness, respect and honesty. Most recently, I took my truck in for a repair of the power steering belt which had failed. They stated that one of the bolts from a timing belt service they had completed months before had been sheered off. Even though they could not immediately pinpoint how or why the bolt was sheered, they took immediate responsibility for the failure of the bolt and fixed my vehicle for FREE, including re-tapping the bolt and installing a new harmonizer! Absolutely incredible! They could have easily taken advantage of the situation and I would have been none-the-wiser. Instead, they now have a customer for life and someone who will sing their praises to everyone who will listen! Thank you Aspen Automotive!]
