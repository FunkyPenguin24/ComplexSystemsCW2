[100754706490733560505,100753676983111744464,I have nothing but good things to say about out experience with Crystal. We started out researching above ground pools in February. After visiting all of the local dealers we chose Crystal over the others because, well they were honest. Brad helped us select everything we needed, but did not try to up-sell us on unnecessary add ons, as well as items that would not suit our particular pool situation. Other dealers just wanted to sell, sell, sell. And while I understand that is a salespersons over-all objective, Brad cautioned us on a few things I originally wanted. Brad provided me with all the information we needed to file for a building permit, and we received a call from the installation team in mid-May to schedule. The installation team showed up around 7:30 am and worked until the last detail was complete. They were also accommodating to me by loading up the dirt onto a trailer so I did not need to load it up myself for removal. A few days later Pat came out for our owner orientation. It was starting to rain and just before the storm rolled in he was able to get the pool shocked and chlorinated. I felt bad that he got soaked and his boots were covered in mud from the excavation area. He came back out on a Saturday to complete everything, and thankfully it was sunny. Thanks for everything. The pool is in and we are patiently waiting on construction to begin on our new deck. We will send pictured when the entire project is complete. Justin & Nicole]
