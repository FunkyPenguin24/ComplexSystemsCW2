[114651760119669481480,100208291273396762938,I had the privilege of working with Mike Willock as my sales representative when I came in to look at the 2014 Mazda 6. After searching around for an affordable (yet somewhat loaded) 4 door sadan with good gas mileage I found myself at Mazda. Being in sales myself (and knowing the game) it was very easy to work with Mike as he let the car sell itself rather than force feeding me facts, pricing options, and any other uncomfortable situation salesmen can attempt to get you into. As an educated consumer I already new the flaws of the car, and what I would like about it...I just wanted to drive it, and see for myself what it felt like inside. I loved it from the moment I test drove it to the the moment I drove it off the lot 2 days later (again, with no pressure to buy the first time). For those of you who are posting negative reviews on here you obviously have a skewed perception in thinking that everything is going to go your way in every situation; so wrong. Especially when buying a car, you need to compromise! Nothing in this world is perfect, and what is great for one person may not be for another so don't believe what you read online, just go and see things through your own eyes. At the end of the day I highly recommend the Mazda 6 Touring (with Tech Package) and working with Mike at Napleton Schaumburg Mazda!]
