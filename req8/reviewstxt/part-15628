[118249282819402862832,101001055592855270862,My dog Dakota (and I) LOVES Uberdog! We live in Durham and we've been to other doggy daycares closer to us but Uberdog is our favorite. Dakota used to be very shy and skittish around human strangers (loves dogs though) and her experiences at Uberdog have definitely made her a lot more outgoing and confident. She loves the Uberdog staff and all her friends. Also bonus - there's a great coffee/baked goods shop literally down the street within a couple minute drive - Hartford Baking Company. You should check it out with you are at Uberdog! P.S. If your dog goes to Uberdog and you are on Facebook, you should "Like" them. They post pictures of the dogs on their facebook page and it's super fun to see all the dogs. Dakota is on their facebook page and I showed everyone :)]
