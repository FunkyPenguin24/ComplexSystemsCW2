[107333585515134988276,100616162522617879397,This is a small place out away from everything, and in my opinion worth every second of the trip. Really interesting menu, with options for both normal and adventurous eaters. Nice wine list too, and very friendly staff. Like I said, its small, so during busy nights or seasons I'd suggest a reservation. Been there twice, and had a great experience both times.]
