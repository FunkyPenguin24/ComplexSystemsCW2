[102773733949003674896,101094453859348305286,Will be going back to Wilde for all my future Subarus. Just bought my 3rd Subaru, and they gave me the lowest, by far, price without haggling. The service was great and everyone at the dealer is friendly. I bought my car through Cheryl in Internet Sales and Corey through regular sales. Great experience, not your usual 'car sales' experience.]
