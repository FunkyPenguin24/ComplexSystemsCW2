[107261852027087518848,100450497689583050907,Jack's bakery did an EXCELLENT job on my wedding cake! It was very beautiful and very yummy! My fiance and I met with her months before our wedding to taste cake samples and to tell her what we were looking for in our wedding cake. Not only is she a great listener, she could recall every single detail of that conversation months later! She did a great job with the gum paste flowers! My guests thought our cake was cool and delicious!!]
