[110626875141035369024,101025039602384735382,When looking for a photographer, it was important to my husband and I, to capture all of the details of our day in the photography… and capture it in a unique way. In looking at the Reilly’s professional online portfolio we knew that they would be a great fit for our day. On October 13th 2012 Ben and Megan traveled up to Door County, WI to shoot our wedding and as for the weather that day… It rained all day long and didn't let up. Being a bride can be a little stressful leading up to the ceremony, but when you add cold, rainy weather– when we had envisioned beautiful outside photography. I was a little disappointed, or so I felt for a brief moment. :) Megan and Ben contacted me prior to the ceremony giving me ideas on how we can make this work by being creative with umbrellas, location and the classic car we had reserved. They even drove around in advance to scope out a few locations with beautiful fall color. When I arrived at the church, although nerves were running high they made me feel so comfortable & calm… Almost as if they were family members. They were just wonderful throughout the entire day! Jay and I had a beautiful ceremony in bright country church, got some great shots with family, friends and our two dogs and then ventured out in the rain for some outside photos. All of us huddled under umbrellas – they were so positive and had smiles on their faces the entire time. We laughed about it all and made it fun. Just a few days after our wedding the photos were posted to their online gallery, so it was great so see them so quickly. They turned out absolutely gorgeous and exceeded our expectations! Overall, we are just thrilled with everything from start to finish and we look forward to working with the Reilly’s again when our new family grows someday. Thank you Ben and Megan for everything!]
