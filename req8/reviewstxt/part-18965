[106965855363340460194,100004160369056771808,We have used them for 2 years and have been happy for the most part. They sometimes forget to do my side walks and don't do the best around the mail box, but they are reliable for the most part. We did sign a two year contract of which they forgot about us the second year and I had to call after two snow falls (of which I had to hand shovel) and remind them of the contract. They of course corrected the error and delivered good service. I am not sure about renewing this upcoming season because they want a advanced payment for a total season prior to a single snow fall. They are putting all the risk on to their customers as from what I could gather they don't refund if snow fall is less, but have a extra $10 charge per 1 inch over 60 inches. Giving them 2 years of payment ahead of time is a great deal of money, so we'll likely research other places first.]
