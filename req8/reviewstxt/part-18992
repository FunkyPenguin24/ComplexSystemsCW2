[104265904506863530252,100005592942869001485,We had a couple of friends who have recommended Gwen to us and we couldn't be more pleased with her work. She is super friendly and personable. She knows how to get kids attention in pictures, something we have had issues with other photographers. We loved that she worked in a variety of locations and thought Mt. Margret was so representative of the Colorado look we were looking for in our family shots. Very easy to work with, professional and affordable. I would highly recommend!]
