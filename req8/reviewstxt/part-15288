[107295558868231412392,100981897523981603094,We first came to Mergen Orthodontics when Maria was in third grade. She had one tooth that was out of line, requiring brackets on six teeth. It straightened quickly. She then sported a retainer, made in a bright color, in case she threw it away at school. Everything went well with that tooth. Our experiences with the staff at Mergen were exceptional. Maria got full braces in August 2012 at age 12. Again, staff members were very efficient. After one appointment, Maria said something different had been done. After eating lunch in town, I called the office. Maria kept commenting about a wire feeling different. We were able to get back in for a quick check, which proved the wire needed to be adjusted. I was thankful for their flexibility to get Maria in, saving us the hour drive to come at a different time. I appreciated how they worked with me and our insurance the first time and helped me do a cost comparison for the full set of braces. Having payments taken out of my checking account also made the experience hassle-free for me. I would recommend Mergen Orthodontics because staff members are friendly, caring, efficient, and knowledgeable.]
