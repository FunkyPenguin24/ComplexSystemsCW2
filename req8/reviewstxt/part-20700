[106273627745636824166,100096780549376770860,Go to any other 24hr. This one is way overcrowded and always has broken or missing equipment. To top it off, the whole place smells like feet and has awful ventilation. Who wants to wait a half hour or more for the privilege of using the only 20lb free weights to be found in the whole place? Or maybe stand in line for 20+ min to be able to run in place like a rat in a sauna?]
