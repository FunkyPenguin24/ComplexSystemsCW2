[106556573809531941849,100244398415600285631,Fabulous place, great Chebureki ( meat or cheese filled deep fried dumplings), Satzivi ( cold chicken with walnut sauce, Soup Harcho ( hearty lamb soup, but not as spicy as traditionally in Georgia) Khachapuri is very good although my favourite remains adjaruli khachapuri ( a different style of this dish), Try Georgian wines and Georgian soda ( syrup in mineral water). Great service, fast and friendly. Loved it, would recommend and would definitely go there again.]
