[100929675198935825936,100499305984743302640,Ok so the presentation was a little long for the windows when i met with the sales person. Don't get me wrong he did a great job. Was jsut a long day for me that day. But could not be happier with the product on the 2 windows they installed. I had 2 windows replaced in a house that was built in 1952. windows fit perfect first time look like orginal but with all the advancements of todays windows. The installer who put them in was great hard worker and very very clean when he was done all i had to do was put everything back. Highly recommend this company will be using them in the not to far future for some other replacement projects. Again THANK YOU]
