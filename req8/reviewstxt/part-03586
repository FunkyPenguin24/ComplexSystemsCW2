[106648424799292309819,100345735079129271541,So I was looking for a phenomenal group of people in a tattoo parlor. I came across the place because I shop at the Harley Davidson store next door to Top Rocker, and walked in and took a look at the artists, my gut screamed at me about one artist in the shop, Miss Bird. I looked at the portfolios in the shop, there were no names on any of the portfolios. I flipped through the artists and Julie Birds fit the idea of schemes and styles are what I had in mind. I asked who's portfolio it was and it turns it was Miss Birds'. Turns out she is a newly licensed artist but she is beyond amazing. I showed her a picture of what I'd like for a general idea, and said I'd like you to sketch up something similar but have some fun with it. Boy, did she. I was blown away with the finished ink by her. There isn't any flash up in the shop, my impression I got was they like original work. The shop was clean, there wasn't any drama or bad attitude from any of the artists. It was all positive energy, and Julie told me (not a direct quote) “I won't do negative ink, because bad times in life are only temporary.” The whole vibe was positive. I watched a kid come in and get his first tattoo with his mother present, and the artist, Danny, took his mom back and started everything up and explained it to her while he did it and why sanitary practices are performed in the shop. I watched her go from very tense to extremely relaxed, she had not a drop of ink on her body. When a mother can come into a shop and watch her child get his first ink and be at ease speaks volumes about the shop as an entirety. Inside Phoenix area there is only one place I will be getting ink. Matter of fact this is the only shop I will be getting ink at.]
