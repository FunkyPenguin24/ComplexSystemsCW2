[106314870325233415602,100113181782658987332,I bought a Groupon for 10 classes at this gym. So far, I've tried the spin class and liked it. There's only a small number of bikes, but the instructor was good and it was a good change of pace for me. The gym is clean and the staff are friendly. It's also in a great location and easy to get to after work!]
