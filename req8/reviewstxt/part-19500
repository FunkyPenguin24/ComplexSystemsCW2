[112392011382158781345,100032959320705987835,We spilled drain cleaner on our fancy marble vanity top and it burned a wide area making it rough and dull. Atlas Marble was recommended by a friend and we contacted them to see if they could repair the damage. It would have cost us a couple of thousand dollars to replace the stone. They asked for pictures, which we sent via email. They said they could repair it, and we made an appointment. The technician/craftsman arrived on time and started work. He prepared the area, put down floor covering and wore booties on his feet. It took the morning to do the work. The vanity top is like new; actually better than new. We couldn't be more pleased and would highly recommend Atlas Marble & Stone.]
