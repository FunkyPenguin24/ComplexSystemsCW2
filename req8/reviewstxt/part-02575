[100664582466176923424,100291293678387691930,I love this place! They have an amazing collection of Japanese and Korean furniture with pieces that fit in a variety of settings. I have had a number of their pieces for several years and they still look great. The staff there are really friendly and knowledgeable without ever being pushy. The owner, Dale Storer, knows his business well and has always been a great source of advice and provides first-rate service. Highly recommended.]
