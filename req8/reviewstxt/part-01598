CUTEST space ever. Black and white for the main colors with touches of wood and hardware to home up the place. The chandelier gives you so much light. The service was great. The person behind the counter was both bright and cheerful. I ordered a blueberry hazelnut muffin and the roast beef sandwich. When I got my sandwich I discovered the only downside I've seen of this place...the sandwich's enormity. This really isn't a downside, it's just a cautionary note. 1 sandwich = two meals. I defy people to make it one and then pity for their foolhardy arrogance. Bring a wheel barrow and a friend to push you home if you're going to try this. The sandwich was great, crisp french fried onions, mild emmental, cress, and rare roast beef. What could be better! All in all, I have to say that this place has amazing baked goods. I could eat one of the blueberry hazelnut muffins every day. Not too sweet, full of blueberries, nice balance with the nut. All I have to say is, Get you one!]
