[115005096558453911943,100880256255876309596,This past week I had to take my dogs in for a check up because my one dog had been scratching her ears non stop. I called the office and the person said that I could bring them in asap if I wanted too. My dog had been whining since 4 am that morning, so I did. The vet was so cool she met me at the reception area and brought the dogs in to give them a check up. My dogs were very scared to be there, which was apparent by their behavior . The vet sat on the floor with them to get them comfortable and then did the check up. She was gentle and caring and she took care of them. I was very pleased. I admit it was different from other vet experience, in other offices, which I have experienced in the past. The other offices seem to have been very sterile and conforming. This doctor was so caring and I would for sure bring them back to this vet office. Thank you and I appreciate a caring doctor with very reasonable rates.]
