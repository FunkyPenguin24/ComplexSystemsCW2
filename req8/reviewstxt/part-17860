[116256876754974779440,101122346001811698490,Outstanding. I bought a CK suit from Macy's. Pants needed hemming and I needed it done in 4 days. Went to Macy's and in addition to charging me extra for the rush were going to ring me up for $20 (cya). I called this place and said they could have it done in time for only $8. Went there and they sized me up. The woman was really friendly. The kicker - I asked if they could fix a few more things that would've added $20 more to my bill but she was insistent that the pants were a good fit and that any more would only cause discomfort. Pants were done in time and they fit like a glove. Speedy, affordable, honest, and local. I'm going back.]
