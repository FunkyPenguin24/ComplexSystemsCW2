[105470728268703036948,100974981074317018439,This place is passable....in terms of quality of fish, it's decent for the price, but their interpretation of some things makes me laugh. It's clear this place is meant for speed rather than taste, I ordered a Salmon Skin Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll and Tuna Roll. All 3 were ready to go in 5 minutes...unheard of for what I ordered. I got back to my office and settled in to dig in. I discovered the "Shrimp Tempura" is really Diced Shrimp with Tempura Flakes. Not hot fresh from the fryer. The Salmon Skin was prepared clearly earlier this day or the day before, and the Tuna was good quality overall. I likely will not go back, but if you want inexpensive sushi that will at least fill you up, feel free to go.]
