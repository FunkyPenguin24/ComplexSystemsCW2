[103396960089545772754,100072561511707343233,I found a car online at Midlands Honda and spent several days in discussions with various salesmen about the price and condition. I was assured that it was in great condition besides some minor scuffing on the rear bumper. I drove two hours from Charleston to buy the car and when I arrived I immediately saw that the bumper had been knocked out of alignment and was dented, and there were scratches all over the interior and exterior of the car. The man who gave me the test drive kept remarking on the poor quality of the car and said we shouldn't buy it. They were unwilling to take more than $60 off the price despite the damage and they refused to fix it. Overall, everyone we met there had a disrespectful, dishonest attitude and I won't be going back.]
