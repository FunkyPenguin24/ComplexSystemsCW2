[113533910159115841393,100465962172607876907,I get waxed regularly and this year I decided to try a few different places to compares services. The woman was running late which is absolutely acceptable if you inform the customer rather than them sat there wondering when they are going to be seen. On inspection at home I can visibly see patches that have been missed. I paid for a full leg and hollywood, given that there is not much hair on the bottom of my legs I did not expect her to take long, and assumed she would be thorough in other places. This was not the case, I am left a little disappointed. If you ask for it all off it means you want to be left completely bare, I wont be revisiting here for a wax.]
