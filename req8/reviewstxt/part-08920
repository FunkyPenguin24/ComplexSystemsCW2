[115110577893336204102,100634168220946195229,I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE!!! It was soooo easy to switch the number. Seamless, smooth transition. I always hated the fact that I barely missed getting a 212 number. I had a 646, better than 347, - I know it is vanity, but who cares?! - but it just irked me. I mean, I live in Manhattan; so, why shouldn't I have a 212? Anyway, my number is easy to remember, and the transition process and customer service was phenomenal. Top notch. I highly recommend it.]
