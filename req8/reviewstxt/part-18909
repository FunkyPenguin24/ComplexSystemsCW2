[114278440259025776503,100001715465230430585,We visited last night for the last time. Service was horrible. It's like the bartender did not want to be there. He refilled his own drink while my husbands glass was completely empty. He did not write our order down and had to come back to make sure he had remembered it correctly. Then when the food came, we did not have napkins or silverware. He did not offer to refill my drink when it was empty,..I had to ask. And we were sitting at the bar...right in front of the drink station. The sweet potato tater tots should be a dessert or let guests know that they are not a savory and salty side for you burger. Ugh, this was a waste of $40.]
