[106913445980103456454,100014059081518074662,My experience was good with this pub, up until I went to the bathroom. I walked out of the bathroom and found my table cleared, my bear/food gone, and no bar tender to be found. I ordered, paid for a beer, then this sad excuse of a pub cleared my table, tossed my beer before I could even drink it, and expected me to leave the pub because they wanted to close since there were no other customers at 9:00 PM. What a sad excuse of a pub.]
