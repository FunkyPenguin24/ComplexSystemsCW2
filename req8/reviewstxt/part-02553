[113369021815747134771,100290513077439580507,This has to be the worst place I have ever tried to do business with! Three plus weeks ago i called them for a price to have an above ground pool liner installed in my pool. I was told they were about a week and a half out. They sent their installer out to look at it and got back to me with a price. I told them to go ahead and do the work and they took credit card information. 21/2 weeks later I called to find out schedule. That was on a Sunday and was promised early of that week. No show. No call (real professional). Very patiently called on Wednesday. Was told by Friday it would be done. Its now Friday late afternoon and still no show and no call. Call them back. Installer is there (must be real busy). He gets on the phone with me with a chip on his shoulder (it must be my fault that theyve made 2 broken promises to me) and basically tells me he'll get to it when he gets to it. I'll be calling someone else. How do companies like this stay in business....]
