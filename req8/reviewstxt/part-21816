[102801882324981091536,100157153518547279212,Animal Care Hospital has been caring for our herd since 2004. Recently we had to put one of our cats down. I struggled mightily with the decision, and frankly, am still second-guessing myself. Dr. Lindsay wrote the most amazing sympathy card. They understand and care about our pets. Why anyone would even consider another clinic is beyond my comprehension. I wished my primary physicians were as sympathetic, caring, and proactive as the staff at Animal Care. My remaining pets will live long, productive lives thanks to these wonderful people. Thank you!]
