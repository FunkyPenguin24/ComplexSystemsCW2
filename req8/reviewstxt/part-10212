[109960366004354050409,100705144593058575356,I got there @ 3pm on Monday. It was an under warrenty service, and the wait was estimated to be 2 hours. I was hoping to take the shuttle home since I live very close by. But I waited 1 hour 15 min in the waiting room. There was any shuttle available. So I walked to the near by outlets to kill the rest of the 45 minutes. By the time I got tp the dealer it was 5:10, and my car wasn't ready. I need to walk up to hurry them to get my car by. By the time I left the car dealer, it was 5:30.]
