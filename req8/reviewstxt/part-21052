[110736527267869069335,100115389813883208402,As a native San Antonian, my out of town friends always ask me for a place that locals love. I always tell them to go here. It's so old school, old "san antone" (which nobody calls it any more), you'll swear your Abuelita is in the back making those fresh, yummy corn tortillias. Saturday is tortilla soup day - need I say more? (hope that's still true, I've not been in a while...)]
