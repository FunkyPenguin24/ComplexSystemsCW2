[102942775045694721493,100070964811506845017,The people working there were nice enough, but didn't fully know what they were talking about, and had they admitted to it, I would've been OK. Instead they tried to BS me. I ended up buying a kit for my step mom, which was their starter kit. Not sure how well it works because my step mom never really stuck to using it. I also purchased two replacement kanger heads, and this is what made me really angry. I asked for two kanger heads, 1.8ohm. Instead, what I got was two rip-off clone heads, at 2.2ohm. Basically, they staff deliberately scammed me, or they have no idea at all what they're talking about. In either case, you're much better off shopping online, unless you have a serious time crunch.]
