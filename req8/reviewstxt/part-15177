[102924546338482240491,100975755031719996613,Wasn't a huge fan of Steam Whistle prior to taking the tour. I certainly appreciate the beer a lot more now. It was incredible, all the things I never knew about Steam Whistle and beer making! I love the atmosphere and the friendliness of everyone who works there! The tour packages are GREAT deals, and I love their free art shows every month.]
