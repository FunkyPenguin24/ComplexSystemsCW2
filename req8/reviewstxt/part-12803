[104008299768628869155,100845658047518068188,Negotiated a great price over the internet. Got the model, color and just the accessories I wanted. Went to pick up the car and that is where they fell short. Even though I had given them all my information, including Social Security number, and a Credit Card for a deposit. When I arrived nothing had been filled out, or processed. So, I wasted over 3 hours just sitting around waiting for the salesman, business manager and financing people to fill out forms. I felt like they didn't respect me, or value my time. It was clear that as soon as the deal was done, it was no longer important to anyone in management that I dealt with professionally and delivery of the car be expedited.]
