[113517130472068146971,100164108299757492601,We were traveling from out of town and bought a groupon deal for this place. We walked in to a completely empty restaurant and were immediately told they would only honor one groupon for our entire party (we had 3 and were prepared to buy at least $20 per groupon used) This is NOT a sit down restaurant.. it's a fast food fried seafood place, yet they refused to honor our groupons. We decided to leave.. I guess despite having ZERO people in there they did not want to sell $60+ worth of food. We are going to have our groupons refunded.]
