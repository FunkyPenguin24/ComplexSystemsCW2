[108120238657105200743,100653875533444600713,After the dealership told me I need a new muffler at $840+Labor, TLC quoted me $120+Labor. When I arrived the tech looked at the problem, told me I did NOT need a new muffler, and fixed it by replacing a small section of the muffler instead, for only $50 and in just 20 mins!]
