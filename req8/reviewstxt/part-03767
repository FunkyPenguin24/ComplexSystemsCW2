[102823192461570405436,100356780834887868700,Some of the best fried pickles I've ever had. Great locals place. Service a bit slow, but food and friendliness worth the wait. Unfortunately, cannot get a wheelchair in the front door (didn't try the back). Clean and restroom was very clean. Very accommodating to my vegetarian friend. Home made potato chips on the table first thing were excellent. Large beer menu -- I'll be back for dinner to sample some. Really good crabcakes, too. Yum!]
