[100571450176625307435,100538118696493941406,The service here was terrible. All I wanted to do was ship a 0.2 lb package, and apparently that's not enough to warrant basic attention. I filled out the shipping slip and stood there while the employee helped another person who had come in after me, finally tossing my package at another employee (who had been chatting with a friend since I walked in) with the question, and I quote, "You can do this while you're talking, right?" Apparently she could not. I was forced to just stand there while the employee happily gabbed away with her friend, not bothering to greet or even acknowledge me, let alone do her job and assist me with my package. The friend finally left but the employee even never looked at me once, just punched in the info and charged me. The prices were extortionate as well; I was charged nearly $12.00 just for a 0.2 lb package. Never use this location unless you want to be ignored and overcharged. I'll never be coming back.]
