[111273251852134116973,100485029305168110115,We lost most of the grass in our backyard in the summer of 2011. Jeremy and his crew were able to replace the sod with a specific grade of grass that will be more resistant to the weather deviations we have in this part of SE Texas. They also were able to match the sod to go along with the other vegetation in our back yard. The best part, the price was a lot less than we expected.]
