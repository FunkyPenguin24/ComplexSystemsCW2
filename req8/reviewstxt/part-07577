[101615209336964063211,100564587478569550251,I’ve been blind as a bat my entire life. I’ve always wanted to get LASIK done but have always been afraid of laser eye surgery. I finally gathered the courage to undergo the procedure after breaking my glasses for the tenth time! I researched Pannu Laser Vision and saw all the great reviews, so it was natural for me to choose them. I had my procedure performed last week in Fort Lauderdale and could not be more pleased with the results! My eyesight is now 20/20 and I see better than I ever did with glasses or contact lenses. I was very impressed with his staff and offices as well.]
