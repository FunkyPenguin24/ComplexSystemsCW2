[100195205731518375148,100424412735783831515,This shop sets itself apart from others on so many levels that it's hard to list them all. Friendly service is relatively common, but it's rarely followed with competence, understanding and no-BS approach that Tom and his crew provide. I can always rely on their advice and help while being confident they will do an excellent job in a timely manner and for a very reasonable price. They are a busy bunch, but always find time to explore and explain the options and guide their customers towards an optimal solution. I've been riding for over 30 years and do most maintenance myself but never think twice about trusting Cyclewerx with more complicated jobs. My sincere recommendation.]
