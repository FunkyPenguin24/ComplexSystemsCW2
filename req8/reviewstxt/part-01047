[101884734932233404529,100213271080760641577,I love Dr. Chalkin. I visited so many doctors to get relief from tennis elbow. Rather than giving more steroid shots, Dr. Chalkin sent me to Tulsa Hand Therapy, a wonderful group of people who worked wonders for my elbow. We are very lucky to have a doctor with his experience and expertise. If he hadn't fallen for an Oklahoma woman, he might have stayed in Boston. I'm grateful for his service to this city. Julie.]
