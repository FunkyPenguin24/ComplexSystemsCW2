[110259443522139877324,100062377761748028754,I have bought several vehicles over the years here but never again. I told them I wanted my credit union to do the financing. The sales manager told me he could do a "soft inquiry" just to see if he could beat them. MONSTER mistake on my part. I just got my 7th notice of HARD credit inquiries. I emailed and called them to give them the opportunity to correct their "mistake." They will not respond. I just bought two vehicles from another dealer. Bummer. They have a great service department.]
