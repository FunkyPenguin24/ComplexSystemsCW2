[109154716525189172354,100371999635403856971,Worst customer service I've ever experienced in a long time. I've been there for a slice before which was good but not great. However when I tried to order from there, the person on the phone had no customer service skills whatsoever and before I can complete my order they hung up. Thinking the food was on it's way I waited, only to find out the order was never put in. A few months later I decided to give them another chance and call for an order only to have the same thing happen only this time the person on the phone was even more rude. I guess they feel they can afford having terrible customer service. Never again.]
