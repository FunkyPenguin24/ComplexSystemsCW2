[101089282911550937045,100031052544600957957,I got matching tattoos with my grandpa here and the service was excellent. The owner was there and he made my grandpa and I feel very comfortable and welcomed. My session lasted about 3 hours and when it was done I absolutely loved my new tattoo, so did my grandfather. I would recommend this place to anyone looking to get a tattoo or piercing. The staff is very friendly and they make you feel at home. Thanks wyld chyld!]
