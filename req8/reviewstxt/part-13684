[102645219316630174534,100895004624064305205,This place is huge and fun to walk through. If you enjoy blending styles to create your own look, you'll find some inspiration here - from funky farmhouse to industrial edgy to Chinese zen. There are lots of small things as well as major pieces, and in general it's good value for the price, (not expensive but not cheap either). Nothing bad to say here, the staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Win win win!]
