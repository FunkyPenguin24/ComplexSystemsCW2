[100330199835077853028,100164033692826568904,Wonderful stay! I have just spent 12 nights in this hotel, and I prise myself for a good choice. Exellent service, rich half-pension menu, nice location just near the Santa-Ponsa beach, spacious air-condtioned room - I will certainly return to this place. The only disadvantages I can think of are poor bathroom ventilation and noise isolation, but these are small things comparing to all the others. The web-site does not say this, but there is a free Wi-Fi in the hotel lobby. It is also possible to lend (for a deposit) beach towels and hairdryer.]
