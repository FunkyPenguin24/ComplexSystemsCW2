[116025803077393862706,100259051566942751175,"Irish Band" the Irish Band are fantastic and brilliant performers! I was there in Sloane Square when they were performing and entertained many people passing by. They probably sound a lot clearer without the traffic noise behind them in pubs clubs and other venues. Eclectic songs sung to capture the mood and feeling of the moment. Definitely worth going out to see and enjoying the experienceâ€¦]
