[106548590516684209328,100176059418369054190,A huge thank you to Carter Auto Repair. Very professional, with morals and integrity beyond compare. We dropped our Lincoln off, they quoted a better price than their competitors, repaired quicker than expected, and upon arrival to pick my vehicle up, we found the balance to be $200.00 less than the quote we were prepared to pay. Thanks to Tommy and Carter Auto Repair and its team of professionals.]
