[104249922051192984757,100066435733629329558,My experience was fine. I went to NeNe, she knew natural hair very well, after I washed my hair I didn't have any heat damage. She gave me a cut and she took her time and did a great job. I was very impressed with her. She was very gentle with my hair and she didn't pull. I would recommend NeNe to anyone because she was awesome! :)]
