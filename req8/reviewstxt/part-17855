[115903009473374990087,101122172380676323903,We purchased 1200 sq of carpet from Big Bob's and had them install it. The carpet is great and we are pleased with the quality. The installation not so great. There are 7 dents in the wall where we will have to spackel and paint. The corners of the wall are also nicked up and I will have to retouch. I would not recommend their installers if you have a choice.]
