[109669769814925421611,100230202981348019235,We ordered delivery from here last night and it wasn't very good. The sweet and sour pork was the best part of the meal. The Vegetarian Lo Mein tasted a little bit "plasticky", if that makes any sense. The crab rangoons were pretty mediocre, as were the egg rolls. We'll definitely be trying somewhere else next time.]
