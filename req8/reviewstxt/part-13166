[101035554448979432662,100866406259603275769,This company wastes money on lawyers for problems that could be solved if they were anywhere near the properties they managed. Or even had the efficiency to call and make arrangements. This company has no issue suing people without question. If you can avoid them, please do. I fall under Mayfair Station Condo Association, and I am not satisfied. I grew up in a town house, and the association was run by local people who could be communicated with. This association is practically impossible to communicate with. The only way I know that this property management runs my association is because I am being sued.]
