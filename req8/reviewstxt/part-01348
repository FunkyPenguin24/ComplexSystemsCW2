[100655392100068407985,100228791902029391573,I had never been to a Hard Rock Cafe and based on this experience, I will never go to another. The highlight of my day had to be finding a insect in the mac & cheese I ordered for my daughter. Besides that, the food was not very good anyway and it definitely wasn't worth the money. The waiter was very nice and gave us good service, but I will never eat at Hard Rock again!]
