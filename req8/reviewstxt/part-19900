[113215600287761224516,100054375597669563954,I wont say that food was too good, but not bad either. 2 stars for that. But the Service was pathetic. One waiter takes order from me. No action in 10 minutes. Another waiter comes and I repeat my order. He goes invisible for the next 10 minutes. A third waiter comes and serves finally in another 5 minutes. I could see people leaving from at least 2 tables in this time as they were not timely served. I had ordered fish curry meals . Once the meals and the veg curries were served, there was no sign of anyone. I finally got my fish curry when I had completed my meals almost 90 percent. Had to wait for another 10 minutes for a waiter to come and serve me some meals to taste that curry. No side dishes were served the second time. When I was done nobody gave me a bill even. I asked the guy in the counter, what was this all about. He said its a new management. So I think the 2 comments below were for the old management. For the new one , my rating is 0 out of 5.]
