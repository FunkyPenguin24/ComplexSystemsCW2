[109380740645677001323,100445499439642863945,Pros: Credits transfer to other Christian colleges; Large selection of food choices; Hands on experience in ministry opportunities. Those opportunities range from one's ministry assignment, Snow Camp, summer camps, local church involvement, and more. Opportunity to mature spiritually, physically, mentally by learning disciplines of daily bible study, initiative, hard work in one's work assignment, living with others in a dorm, time management just to name a few. Be taught by excellent bible teachers. There is more than one campus. They are in Canada, Korea, Hungry, Argentina, Germany and of course New York and Florida. Cons: Not recommended for one who is of the Reformed Theology. Though you are welcome, they teach Dispensationalism. The facilities are a work in progress as with any school. They are not luxurious, but they function for what the student needs. Personal testimony: I went here thinking I knew a lot about the Bible because of my family life. So in studying the Bible, it became clear to me that life was not about me but about God and glorifying Him in every area of my life. I would recommend going here to anyone (Christian or not, Dispensationalist or not), though I realize this school is not for everyone. The point is the spend one year of your life studying the Bible.]
