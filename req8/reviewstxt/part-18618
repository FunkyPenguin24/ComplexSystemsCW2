[116106943963286618993,101162325945891862137,I'm a regular at this hm and it has its ups and downs. It is constantly packed, even in the early hours and the registers always go so slow! However, you can always find something to wear and they have a great variety. A lot of the staff is rude, but there are a few comical ones that definitely perk you up and make you chuckle. I, pretty much, only come back for the great prices.]
