[113727417791852238059,100018081566434320354,I have been a client of Elizabeth since she set up Dental Matters in Adelaide. I prefer to travel the 30 minutes down South Road to receive her service than to settle for anyone else. The facility is conveniently located close to central Adelaide, the rooms are quiet and calming ( not that there is anything to worry about!) and all the staff are friendly and helpful. Cannot recommend highly enough!]
