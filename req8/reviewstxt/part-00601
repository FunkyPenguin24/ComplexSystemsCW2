[101011434352833046938,100191003065228015051,The experience of attending Cheremoya Elementary School has been really wonderful. What a warm and caring community of teachers and staff. The kids are great and seeing my child's confidence grow from learning how to read (first grader), learning about the natural world, and gaining math skills has been tremendous. It's a small and cute school that has been around since 1915 with tall windows and bright classrooms. There is a brand new garden program and arts drams programs that have been brought in from very active parent participation. VERY happy to have my child enrolled.]
