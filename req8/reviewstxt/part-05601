[101423864787117645869,100456227627266068607,Stayed overnight on a trip down the coast. Sites are well sized although not very private. Was initially worried about fitting a very large tent on the site but needn't have worried. Great beach close by with an interesting shipwreck. Nice bike paths through the park as well.]
