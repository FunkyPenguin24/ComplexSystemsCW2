[101139726949204056648,100272020529080190565,Crystal Pure installed a whole house water filtration system in my home years ago and they are the only firm in the area that can service it. Which is too bad because we get maintenance done once a year and people they send out are CLUELESS. They break things, leave a mess, and sometimes don't even do the work they are supposed to. Once a service person didn't show up and when I called the next day it turns out he'd sat in the driveway waiting for me for an hour--AT THE WRONG ADDRESS. By that time, we'd been using them, at our same address, for 15 years. Avoid this company and you'll avoid a LOT of frustration.]
