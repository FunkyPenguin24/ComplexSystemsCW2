[105238224146004167616,100419681827762951848,Visited Christmas week, was seated in the corner, the temp at table was in the high 50s with cold - outside air blowing on us. When we asked the waiter about the temp, he said its always like that, that's why they don't normally seat people there. Needless to say it was not an enjoyable place to eat a meal. The food was decent, nothing to get excited about, just a burger and too greasy fries.Don't waste you time.]
