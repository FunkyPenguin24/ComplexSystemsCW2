[100566623415043926610,101031718238912959592,Brooklyn Dentist Dr. Oleg Klempner is a warm, welcoming and superb dentist and oral surgeon. His wife is amazing and runs the office with his brother Boris as a business manager. A family dentistry practice and owned and operated by a true neighborhood family! My associates children live in Livingston, NJ and becuase he teaches dental responsibility as part of his pediatric dentistry standard operating procedure, I am sure I will save money in the future! LOL. A commute into Brooklyn from New Jersey to see Dr. Klempner, DDS, means he is worth it! Thanks for everything Doc!]
