[113154994117104614115,100869305956083318037,I have been going to 100% Chiropractic - East (Dr. Ryan) for 3 years. I came to Dr. Ryan not believing in the healing powers of Chiropractic and after my first visit I believed. Within 3 months of seeing Dr. Ryan twice a week, my, collarbone went from being slanted to aligned in a proper way. My back has improved, and I can play basketball pain free and loving the freedom that has been restored in my life. My wife was recently in an accident and once I told Dr. Ryan the details he offered to come to my house and do a treatment on her to ensure no structural damage had been done. This is the type of care you can expect to receive in Dr. Ryan's office. His staff is top notch and a joy to talk too! I appreciate the excellent care and friendship that has developed and I would recommend anyone having spinal, neck, collarbone, leg, etc issues to take the drive to 100% Chiropractic - East and visit Dr. Ryan Betz and his team. Dr. Ryan thank you for giving me my life back!]
