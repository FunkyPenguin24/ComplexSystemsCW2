[106166844698975840089,100999227770083443884,I've received 2 letters now from Mark and his business associate, under two business names - We Buy Houses being the other at the same business address. Both letters are in regards to offering to help settle my mother's estate and/or buy her home. Personally, I've received several of these letters over the last 7 months since my mother's passing, but Mark's have come well after the house was already sold, and now a month past the settling of her estate. Very late to the game and obviously no research done. I think this tactic of trying to liquidate the estate of the deceased by trying to gain trust of the surviving family is disturbing and distasteful. Further, to do it so blindly that they don't even realize that the lead is beyond cold (no death pun intended), shows a lack in professionalism and moral terpitude, that I would steer away from doing business with them even I were in need. Mark, if you read this, and the other reviews I've been posting, please cease sending me any further correspondence. Call me if you have any questions since you have my info.]
