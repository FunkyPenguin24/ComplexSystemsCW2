[114397379333705947646,100297582932525145310,I'm relatively new to Auckland so when my car needed some repairs, I needed a mechanic... Easier said than done in a new town! How do you find someone that is honest, fast, cheap and good at their trade? Anyway to cut a long story short, after searching online, I decided to give Your Neighbourhood Mechanic a go. Well! I feel like I've made a great choice. Chris (the mechanic and owner) is polite and friendly. He has an in depth knowledge and experience working with not only Japanese but also European vehicles (mine is an Audi) and above all he was honest, prompt and reasonably priced. I have now had my car serviced and repaired a couple of times here and have had such good experiences that I felt I should share the secret! I would highly recommend Your Neighbourhood Mechanic if you want a second opinion on a job or are looking for a new mechanic. Give Chris a call!]
