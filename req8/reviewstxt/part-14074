[113004984501399292024,100915313715711340348,Vintage Inns look nice but today they kind of took the mick. The Service was ok and Staff friendly but putting the Kids meal upto £6.95 and finding it impossible to have lunch for three for much under £35 is far too much for a basic pub lunch no matter how many adjectives they use for the descriptions of their standard pub fayre. We were served up stale bread with the soup which one member of staff explained (albiet I think she believed it) that is Ciabatta and it was like that.....Nope Ciabatta stale is still stale. Expensive for a very basic offering!]
