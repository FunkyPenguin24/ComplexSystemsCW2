[115526655596610891282,101142478766840583853,I brought my car in for a scheduled appointment for routine maintenance, and wheel balancing. They were clearly way over booked as there was a long line of other cars in front of me when I arrived. They told me it would be an hour and a half at most. After about 2 hours, the service associate came out and told me that they'd found a problem, and it would not be much longer, but it had to be fixed. When I mentioned I had already been there 2 hours, he offered to sign me op for the shuttle, which would pick me up and bring me back to get my car. I took the shuttle home. After about 3 hours, I hadn't heard from anybody, so I called to see if my car was ready. I was sent to the service associate's voice mail. I called the main line and told them I needed to speak with him directly because I needed my car which had been there for 5 hours. She gave me a number that reached him, and he told me the shuttle would arrive "soon" to pick me up. After another half hour, I called again and got his voice mail. I left a message saying I really needed my car, and asking him to call me and let me know when I would be picked up. Then I called again another half hour later, and was told it would not be long, but they could not say when. They close in 45 minutes, and I still have not heard a word. I can't say much about the quality of the service as I haven't seen it yet, but the communication STINKS, and the shuttle service does too! I will be looking for another place to have my car serviced from here on out.]
