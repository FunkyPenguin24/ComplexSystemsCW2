[105431594928337640862,101074360085217350965,I recently bought a Prius V 3 from Peterson Toyota. The sales person, Lee was great. He helped me without any pressure and no games. He gave me a top dollar for my trade and gave me a wonderful price for 2013 model which was still wrapped in plastic. I will recommend him to anyone who needs a new car. Thank you, Lee.]
