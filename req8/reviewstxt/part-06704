[106465658470891335164,100516956363475557344,About two years ago my mother wanted to send a 12 place setting of antique china to her grand-daughter in North Carolina. I took it to this UPS Store. They packaged it for shipping and then sent it on its way. Not one piece was broken. Recently I sent a large cedar chest to my nice. It had been my mother's hope chest and is over 70 years old. I took it to the same store and, again, they packaged it and sent it on its way via UPS freight. It arrived in excellent condition. The sentimental value of these items far outweighed the actual value. It is nice to know you can trust a business with such irreplaceable items.]
