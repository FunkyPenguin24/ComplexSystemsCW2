[106725483070170196986,100844820664877821938,Future Customers beware. Ameripro guarantees customer satisfaction, but I have personally experienced their "guarantee" and it was a nightmare. They quoted the repair of my LG Washing Machine for $250 and asked for a $200 deposit. When that part didn't fix it, they said they needed to order a second part at $200. When the second repair didn't fix it, they needed another $250 for a third part. After 4 weeks with no clothes washer, we asked for a refund so we could purchase a new unit. They agreed, and offered a refund if they could remove the parts they installed. Instead, they removed the entire washing machine from our home, kept it. After multiple attempts to correct the situation, Ameripro decided to keep my washing amchine and not refund our deposit!!! I spent many, many hours on the phone with Stan, Rudy and Michael G and always got the promise of a call back, or another number to call - that no one ever returned. After 2 months of frustration, I filed a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau, and hoping someone (Stan, Rudy or Michael) at Ameripro will finally contact me.]
