[101813375740394665268,100485430352207367505,Took my money but failed to deliver any of the goods purchased. Failed to deliver my vanities 3 times and made me take 3 days of work to wait for the delivery. Spoken to customer service manager John, who is incompetent, rude and refused to offer any help or advice on resolving the issue. Never would purchase anything at this store again!]
