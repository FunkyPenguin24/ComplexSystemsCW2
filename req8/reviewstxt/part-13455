You can get specialty medium pizzas for that price (usually around $15). I have had several satisfactory experiences and one terrible experience. Their deliveries frequently take approximately one hour. My one bad experience: I placed an order for delivery and the estimated time was 40 minutes, no problem. After an hour had passed I called and asked, the manager informed me the driver had left and would be there soon. After another 45 minutes passed (so we are at 1.75 hours since I ordered) I called back and said he still wasn't there. The manager said he would call the driver and then call me back, which he did and said the driver would be there soon. Within 5 minutes I received a call from the driver saying that he was outside my building. I let him in, he smelled like marijuana horribly. He handed over the food and gave me a free 2-Liter of soda for my trouble. The food was hard and cold at this point, but the manager gave me a call back before I had a chance to call him. He asked how it was, I complained of the smell of weed and that our food was cold. The manager offered me 50% off my next delivery, which he honored. I've continued to buy from them since without another bad experience. Update: Had another bad 3+ hour waiting experience with them when ordering delivery. Took 2 hours to get our food and when we got it, we had received the incorrect sandwiches. I then played phone tag with the driver and manager of the restaurant and both of them accused me of lying. I continued to complain until the manager would send me my correct sandwich. Finally, he obliged, and when I opened the box it was just bread chicken and cheese thrown into the box, completely dissembled.]
