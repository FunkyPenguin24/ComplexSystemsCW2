[105577950115202634223,100018023138390164044,A few months ago I backed my brand new Prius into a low brick planter box. (Hey, it was dark, I had not ever used the backup camera, and I m a senior--what can I say!) Needless to say, I wasn t a happy camper. But I took my car into Anderson's and you can't even tell that anything happened. Not only did they do a great job, they were polite and friendly, did not up the estimate, repaired the car quickly, and drove me home and picked me up again when it was done. I would definitely recommend Anderson's for any body repair work that you might need.]
