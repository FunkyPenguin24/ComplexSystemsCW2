[111889845609697140901,100073172370016797734,I have an RV that came equipped with a Kenwood in dash DVD, Nav, bluetooth, ipod, FM unit. It stopped working. The folks at Santa Fe auto sound, worked with me to obtain proof of purchase from the RV manufacturer for warranty purposes. They then took the unit out of the vehicle, sent it off to Kenwood for the warranty repair. When the unit was shipped back they promptly called me and had the unit back in and working great. They then took the time to show me some of the cool features on this unit that I would have never noticed. Very happy with the work and taking the time to help me solve my problem. Their charges for all of this work were very fair.]
