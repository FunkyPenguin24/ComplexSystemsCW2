[117164685680320698064,100156762473772641994,After taking my 2010 Cadillac Escalade ESV to a local Cadillac dealership and getting ripped off, I took it to Johnny over at J.W. Auto Care to take a look at all the "Recommended Services" (over $1000 worth) for a second opinion. Not only did they give me an honest answer about what really needed to be done (most of it did not) they found a few things the Cadillac Dealership missed and gave me a much better price on the work that did need to be done. Good, honest work at a fair price. Can't ask for much more than that!!!]
