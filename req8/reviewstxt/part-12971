[102857605080996096542,100855424368610247513,Our old refrigerator died so we bought a new french door refrigerator from Leroy's Appliances. They delivered it the same day and moved out the old one. Later we saw a similar model much cheaper. We expected to pay a little more at Leroy's and was willing to given the quality of service and honesty we have always received from them. Leroy's has been good to us in the past and went the extra mile with other incentives to let us know they appreciated our business. We will continue to buy from them knowing they are competitive.]
