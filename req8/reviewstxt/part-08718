[102695347526907720795,100624490781374284152,After moving back to New Lenox a year ago I thought I had found a daycare as good as the one we were leaving behind. However, after going through two really bad ones we finally found LaPetite and have not looked back since. They are wonderful there and take really good care of my children. You know you are in the right place when you kids come home "messy" and tired by the end of the day. A parent couldn't ask for better than that. I would highly recommend then to all parents who are in need of a good daycare.]
