[104113506395734853409,100737939098947465458,We held an outing at Penn Oaks and were thoroughly pleased with the golf course, service and price given. They reacted quickly to all our questions and concerns; we planned the outing in less than 1 month! The course, although off season, was still in great shape. The food was delicious and service outstanding. I won't hesitate to contact them again in the future.Steve took very good care of us.]
