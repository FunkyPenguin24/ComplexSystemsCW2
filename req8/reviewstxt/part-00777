[104249840062398641531,100199472037957424557,This me introduced to the world of waterfalls. I hadnt seen any waterfalls before. And when I got a glimpse of this piece I skipped a heartbeat. I was taken aback that it would blow me with it hurricane like force. The water was flowing with gushing speed and the sprinkles of the falls could be seen and felt from quite a distance. Prefer the peak monsoon season to visit this place as without that the place not be quite a waterfall. There is a sesa goa mining place below that fall, after a temple and the "moksh dham", which is connected by a small iron bridge which is quite exciting to walk on when there is a lot of water flowing through it. Also for the Gujarati friends there is a "Mahaprabhuji Baithak" temple. There were also some caves nearby but due to heavy rains we didnt go there. But overall a place worth visiting in the peak of monsoon.]
