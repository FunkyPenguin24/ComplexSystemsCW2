[107872174739703205871,100793137498420793981,I recently atended a wedding where the bride and groom hired Mr. Johnson as the DJ. As a wedding planner I see quite a few DJ's over the course of a year, some are good and some are not. Chuck was wonderful! He kept the party moving from the beginning to the end and was very professional and friendly while he did it. I would strongly recommend him as a DJ for any of your weddings or events!]
