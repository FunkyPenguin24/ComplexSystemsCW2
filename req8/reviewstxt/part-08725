[100862801203804404936,100624729371414568181,When I decided to move to a new house, Metropolitan Organizing LLC was at the top of my list of phone calls to make. I had lived in my home for almost 25 years and needed to weed out a lot of items before the move. Every session with my team has been immensely helpful. They assisted me with purging, organizing, and moving out of the old house, which included two attics and a garage. Now that I am in my new place, they are working with me to find solutions that fit my needs, lifestyle, and space. They are delightful people --- completely unfazed by clutter, pest problems, dirt, dust, indecisiveness, time pressures, heat, cold, rain, or snow! These are top-notch professionals. Do not hesitate to call them; you will be thrilled with the results.]
