[102550627331942247353,100366507692139062426,This review is for the suit department in the Men's Department. Martin spent about two hours with me revamping my wardrobe. He didn't pressure me into buying expensive suits that I didn't want; he listened to what I wanted to buy and steered me in that direction. After picking out 3 suits and 2 sport jackets, he spent extra time with me and went to the shirt and tie area and helped me coordinate my suits with a few shirts and ties. He also clued me into a few sales Macy's was having and saved me over $800 on my purchases. The combination of spending extra time with me to make sure I was happy with what i was purchasing and saving me money earns Martin and Macy's a page in my book!]
