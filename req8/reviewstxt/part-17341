[100989947857830323509,101094117535355747723,I've always been afraid of going to a mechanic which has caused an increasing number of problems with my vehicle. Finally, I went to Tony's on recommendation from google/yelp/reddit, everywhere that says Tony's is the best. They were right. Tony is quick, inexpensive, and very personable. I was under the impression that it was time to scrap my car, however, he fixed it and I feel like it will be reliable for a long time.]
