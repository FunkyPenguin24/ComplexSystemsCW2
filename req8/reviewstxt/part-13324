[113950154139385417753,100875138723395639828,90% of the time there are only a couple of registers open and they are all on one end of the store. When I asked the manager about it he said he does that so the floor manager doesn't have to walk from one end of the store to the other. Last week I was in the same store. there were 2 registers open with no less than 20 people in line waiting to be checked out. I had to get out of line and go to the service desk to get another register open.]
