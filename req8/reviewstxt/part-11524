[116167993669821240538,100774929486453905416,I have been coming to Cass St for years now, great place to get away from the tourists, couple blocks from the beach, and the beers are decently priced. The teryaki steak sandwich is bomb too, but they've never had fries. They have Burgers, chicken sands, and other sandwiches, but they have NO FRIES! They have these cube potato things that you would only order if you were at another restaurant and had ordered an omelet, and they happen to be out of hashed browns so you got stuck with the cubes with bad cheese melted on it. I need some crunchy onion rings or fries with my burger and beer, sorry. Who on this lovely earth do you know that doesn't love french fries? All you need is a frier, easiest thing to make at any restaurant. Anyways, the only other bad thing about this place is the way they store their pint glasses in the ice water germ infested little sink thing below the taps. The bartender handles all this cash and change in her hands, and sticks her dirty fingers in "the pint glass pool" only to pull the pints out with her fingers INSIDE the glass AND around the rim where my lips are about to go! I always have to wipe the rims because I am not about to put my lips on that, we all know how much an average bartender handles money and regular duties. My lips and mouth don't want anything to do with dirty money fingers. And I wouldn't have blown them up on here if they would have let me email them, but they do not have an email address. Still a fun place to hang out at and shoot pool with some beers, maybe I'll just order bottled beers from now on..]
