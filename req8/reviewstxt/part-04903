[102502623489754123042,100418443304445093903,I bought 3 different items from this place: 1) GPS 2) PS3 3) iPhone 4 All of them are good products, but I had a hard time buying the items. It was hard to find someone to help me out, and those that "helped" me were really rude! I like their products and the best buy credit card service, but I hate the customer service! UPDATE: Buying 1 Acer Iconia and 1 external hard drive took me about 1 hour (I knew what I needed, in other words I didn't need help, I wanted to pay!), but there where only 2 workers in the computer area, one was a really nice guy, unfortunately the lady that he was helping was taking forever to make her choice. The other guy wasn't that great, I gave him the description of the external hard drive, he took about 10 mins to get it, and it was the wrong one, so when I told him that was the wrong hard drive, he tells me "I don't know what you're talking about". What kind of answer is that??? I hope this helps.]
