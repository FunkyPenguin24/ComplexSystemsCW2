[118056180263824587936,100850519685148112322,I’m a single female who knows what I wanted and needed it in a very short period of time. My vehicle was totaled in early December; by the time I received the check from the insurance company – Christmas was within days. I needed an AWD vehicle with a remote control car starter. Those were my only two requirements. With the holidays quickly approaching, I was worried that a dealership wouldn’t be able to install the remote controller starter before I took the vehicle off the lot. I was wrong! The car was prepped and ready to go when I needed it! I walked in, completed all the paperwork and was on the road within less than an hour and it was late evening on a Friday night. Even though it was close to closing time – John, Fred and Roy were very professional and made sure I had all my answers before leaving the lot without feeling rushed.]
