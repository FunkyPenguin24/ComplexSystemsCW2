[106716526756512754074,100151557814825574804,I'm forced to use them for service because of my warrenty. I brought in my car with intermittent problems, in on case the Blue Tooth was not broadcasting. My phone could see the Garmin blue tooth in the same car. The definition of intermittent is it doesn't always happen. They said it was my phone since their's worked. Several days later not only was my phone not working, but three other blue tooth devices. I also reported other intermittent problems, and they simply said it was working. I wanted to make sure intermittent problems were recorded during the warranty period. They treated me with contempt. When I'm out of warranty I'll bring my car to University Imports, where I always had a great experience. Also, I asked for synthetic oil, there was no paperwork saying they used synthetic oil. The service advisor said he told them to use synthetic oil. Not only was there no documentation, but there was a traditional oil sticker, 5-30, synthetic is 0-20. I pointed that out and they said they must have put that sticker as a reminder for tire rotation. They treated me like a moran.]
