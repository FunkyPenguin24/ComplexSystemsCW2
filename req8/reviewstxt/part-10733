[101930834696228959917,100733045508335667826,Lovely food, very busy but service was excellent. My brother, who doesn't like Indian food was persuaded to try a few things by our waiter..and he thoroughly enjoyed them....until he got carried away and tried my husbands chicken ceylon (which had a hidden bite back)! One of our dishes was a little too hot , so we were brought another slightly less hot one.Would highly recommend.]
