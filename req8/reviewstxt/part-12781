[104313923227045396924,100844328204576664755,Excellent service, fast and reliable. We chose Emergicare because it was the only one we found to be opened until 9 pm on Friday. The waiting time was 15 minutes; test results (strep throat) took around 10 minutes; purchased medicine at their facility, very convenient. Dr. Beecroft was very polite and great with both of my children.]
