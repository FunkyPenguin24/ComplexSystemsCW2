The decor is a step above most coffeehouses I've been to and resists stereotype while still featuring local themes and artists. I recommend ordering a macchiato or one of their slow bar coffees. The service team is always friendly and eager to help. At the end of the bar they have a record player and a collection of vinyls that patrons can get played. There's also a table in the back you can reserve for small groups or events.]
