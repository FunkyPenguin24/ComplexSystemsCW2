[110716282221940958728,100174117388845582139,We used Baynham Home Improvements during 2012. In particular Phil Baynham who completed the renovation of our sitting room which in its own way presented numerous challenges. The over view of the work that needed to be done was to open up the fire place to enable a double sided wood burner to be installed, then to re-plaster board all the walls and beamed ceiling. He then leveled the 32 sq mtr floor to enable him to install a solid oak wood floor, which was done to a meticulous standard. Overall the whole conversion was completed in time and with the minimum of fuss, I would recommend Baynham Home Improvements for any work that may be required and will be assured of satisfaction.
