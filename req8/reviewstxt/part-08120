[101047002701589536329,100593925181047013447,I Just had the misfortune of meeting the jerk that works at this store. His name is Greg and it was the most distateful customer service I had ever been met with in my life. I have purchased cars, expensive furniture from ACTUAL furniture stores and had the ability to buy whatever I want from anyone else, but my money is NOT good enough for this douche bag. He was disrespectful, curt, over talked me and my roommate without letting us get a word in. He called us dumb, and said "don't come back" when all I said was goodbye and thanks I'd like to shop around. I wish there was a way to give him a negative 100 but unfortunately, Google doesnt match his level of douche baggery. Heres to you greg and your 2 million dollar inventory that you will probably hold on to because your an @ss. Take care :)]
