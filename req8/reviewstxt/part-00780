[102683020719127150631,100199553708537524949,I had large gold ring that i wanted to sell and a sapphire cocktail ring that I would consider selling as well as a diamond solitaire that I already had a certified appraisal on. He low balled me on the gold ring saying that its 22K stamp was a forgery. It was confirmed by a bullion dealer that it was indeed 22K as stamped. On the cocktail ring he offered 20% LESS than a pawnbroker. Pawn brokers try to get about .10 on the dollar. But the kicker was the solitaire. I took this along not to sell it but to use it as baseline reference. First he asked if i had it certified. I said "no" An AGS certified round brilliant cut, 3 carat, f-g color, VVS1 with two nicely cut .15ct diamonds either side. It's a nicely designed platinum setting. He felt he could get $9000. The 1990 appraised value was $55,000. Today, the current Wholesale price on the main diamond alone is between $65,000 and $80,000. Even accounting for the difference in Market price vs appraised price, this was an extraordinary low ball. If you look through their web site you see that they claim to be "Certified Gemologists" but they don't list their credentials. Usually if a company is AGS they are pretty proud of it. So I guess they price about the same as your pawnbroker. Is that a rip-off?]
