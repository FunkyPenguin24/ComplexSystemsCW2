[116943545689407146097,100281774440522282548,Dr Curia is the only dentist I would ever recommend. He is an artist, for one thing, and not only has he never, ever hurt me, but his greatest concern is that he does NOT hurt you - he is amazing. The pain-free is only one of the reasons I suggest him for all ages. Doctor also won't let you leave his chair if your bite is not PERFECT - I MEAN PERFECT. I truly love this dentist. I am old and difficult with aging but he still treats me like a much cared for patient. He never rushes. When I leave his office, I sometimes hear my own voice say, "Thanks for the good time!"]
