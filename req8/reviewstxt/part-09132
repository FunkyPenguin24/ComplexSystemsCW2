[100413189381100531993,100646083555569500027,We had an amazing stay at 'Sitting on the City Wall's - we stayed in a double room. Room was all we needed incl. lamps in the bathroom that keep you warm when you get out of the shower. Winter and even spring in China can be cold so that is certainly nice for those early mornings. The hostel also organised a trip for us to the Great wall of china. In fact an amazing hike of 4 hours with stunning views. The courtyard in the hostel is a lovely place to eat, drink some nice tea or just hang out. For my kiddo (only 9) this hostel was his favourite place to stay during our trip throughout China and Japan :)) In the courtyard there is also a dartboard, a tv showing sports and just around the corner there is a playground where he socialised with some Chinese kids. In all just perfect !]
