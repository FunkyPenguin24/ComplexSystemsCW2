[104867673338522107776,100469700426227565904,I had back, neck, and head injuries from a car accident, but after my sessions at Dr. Park Acupuncture, I no longer had those injuries. Dr. Park also helped with my chronic migraines, stomach pains, and knee/ankle pains/sprains from sporting injuries in the past. I would look forward to my 30 minute sessions every week--gives me an excuse to have some "me-time" while getting better during the process. The staff is very friendly, the facility is relaxing, inviting, and clean. Dr. Park knows his stuff, explains the process and everything you need to know without all those complicated medical terms. I would highly recommend Dr. Park Acupuncture.]
