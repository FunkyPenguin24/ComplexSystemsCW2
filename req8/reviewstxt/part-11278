[108628073170294864865,100762658611928635954,Rachel has an unbelievable ability to capture both the personality of her subject and the moment in time. That is exactly what you want in your photographer! Rachel makes her shoots fun and tailors them to the individual. My daughter, who is now 12, still talks about the extended session we had with Rachel when she was 7 or 8! Her professionalism and product is remarkable but her character is what sets her even farther apart.]
