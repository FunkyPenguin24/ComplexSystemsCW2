[112752074467245886080,100917707350798412409,I made my first visit to Town Tire (8th Avenue location) yesterday, I needed 4 new tires for my Camry. I had a great experience from beginning to end. Fair prices, great customer service and a friendly environment. I've been going to the local Toyota dealership for the past 5 years, but I'll be using Town Tire from now on.]
