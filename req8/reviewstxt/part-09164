[117402737722239704710,100647514812464875789,I came in to these guys Feb of 2013. They replaced my windshield for me. Extremely fast install. When I set my appointment I was told an hour 1/2 for completion but they had me out in a little under an hour. After I had been driving for a few days I noticed an air leak at the bottom. When I came in to get it taken care of they didn't just put extra glue at the bottom, they done the whole job again to make sure it would set right the second time. Everyone was friendly and the service was great and taking care of me the way they did I will never go anywhere else for my Window needs and will be coming back for my tint needs. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to my friends and family.]
