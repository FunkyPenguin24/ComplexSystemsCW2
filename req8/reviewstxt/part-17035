[116549557281009331264,101077812125352839653,I called ahead to make sure they had the product I wanted, and the woman on the phone made sure to check the floor and offered to hold it for me without any prompting. I've been on the phone or internet all day looking for this product and this was by far my best customer service experience today. Given the previous reviews, looks like this store is turning around.]
