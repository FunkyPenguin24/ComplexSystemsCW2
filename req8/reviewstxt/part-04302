[101368558415752075198,100387106372591810490,I have never been in this store, but I have ordered many times online. I live in houston Texas and I love Joseph Ribkoff, but it is only sold in one store and I wont go in the store that sells it. Consequently, I found Rose Tree and have had nothing but totally positive experiences. I have had to contact Jess on numerous occassions via email, and she has always gotten back to me right away and was extremely helpful. I also just ordered a mother of the bride dress and was told it would come in late December...sure enough it came in on time, as ordered. As long as I have such good service, I will continue to order from here.]
