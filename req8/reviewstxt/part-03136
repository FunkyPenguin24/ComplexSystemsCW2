[117746756138124255991,100321411646910410249,About 2 years ago I took my car to get it inspected and emissions they claim that I needed aprox. 1,600 worth of work I got a 2nd estimate at another shop and it was only 800 later I took the same car for a replacement that was covered by the warranty and was told that they could scrape the stickers off and have the other repair shop's license revoked and said they could have me fined and ect.]
