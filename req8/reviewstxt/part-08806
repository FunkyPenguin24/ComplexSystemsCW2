[100345827322678751483,100628160517576210110,Great Service! My wife took her 2002 Mustang GT and had paul look at it due to a Service Engine Light that turned on. Not only did he take a look at it, but he found no issues and let us know that. Anyone could have made up a story and listed a number of reasons and had us spend money to get it fixed, but he was honest. These days, that seems less and less common so I think Paul and his team deserve recognition for not only good work, but honesty as well! I would HIGHLY recommend Paul's Automotive to anyone and everyone!]
