[109912745040278498896,100960150932744430612,Auto accidents are always unexpected. Even if there are no injuries, they are painful in 3 ways. First, there is emotional toll at the time of the accident. “Why me?” (or “How could you!” if a family member or employee was driving). Then there is the inevitable repair cost. Finally, there is the flimflam character behind the desk at the auto body shop. For most of us, few things are worse than the saccharin concern of a grease monkey with an estimate pad and business methods that are difficult to verify. In the business of auto accidents, repairs, and dealing with insurance companies and body shops, be thankful that you live in Worcester or Middlesex County. You can’t do better than working with Steve Paglieroni or one of his mechanics at Kar Kraft in Northboro, Kar Kraft is sister company to JAMN Auto Sales. Steve has survived in a cut throat and often shady business for more than 30 years because he is transparent, sympathetic and honest. He undercuts rivals while crafting a repair that not only looks new, it is durable and safe. I know cars. I know character. My family has trusted Steve going back to when he was a kid working with his Dad. His work is unrivaled. He is dedicated to his clients. He is fair, up front and honest.
