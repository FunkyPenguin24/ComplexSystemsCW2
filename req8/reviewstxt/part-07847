[107886141924345989175,100579855057070579436,I purchased 2 Autos from this dealer. An older truck with High miles and also a sports car. One car had an issue and RPM stepped up to the plate and fixed it with no issues. I understand that buying a used car with high miles has its ups and downs, but to be honest RPM has the best cars in the market. NO Pressure at all from them. When i showed up they explained in detail what cars they had to me that i was in the market for and gave me many options to help me get the cars i wanted. I will not go any place else to buy a car, I'm in my late 50's and have been buying cars for years, i'm happy i now found a place i can trust. The pictures on the website are the best around and show everything about the cars they are selling. Thank you RPM for being good to me and treating myself and my family as we are your own.]
