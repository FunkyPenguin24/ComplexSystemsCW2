[111619848704809316960,100937743971410951674,I've been there 3 to 4 times now and I've always been in and out very quickly with a satisfactory visit. The facility is very clean. The staff was so friendly and made me feel very welcome. My last visit was my favorite. The doctor stitched up a large gash going all the way through my lip. I was worried that I might have a large scar or that the skin would pucker where the stitches were applied, but I'm all healed up and you can't even tell it ever happened. I refer my friends here because of all the great visits I've had.]
