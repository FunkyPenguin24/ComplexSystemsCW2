[106117224774775499253,100755025114936261033,Im sick of being the nice guy. POOR SERVICE! not fair. Dropped off weed eater & scooter for tune ups 1 month ago, I was told it would be 2 weeks... they were a little behind. No Phone calls or followup from them. Horrible customer service. I like and will also choose the Local businesses first. But not this one anymore.]
