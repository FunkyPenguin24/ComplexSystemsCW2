[111171709488223291695,100729300478546289438,Without a doubt one of my favorite restaurants at yonge & finch. The dimsum is pretty good, but pricewise you get much more bang for your buck with the other menu items. Delicious food for a fair price, and a very large selection. Since moving to the area, it has been one of my most often-visited restaurants]
