[111953043997004780551,100454639101795822792,I eat here regularly (at least once a month) for lunch and it's always good. I'm picky when I order but they recognize me and know my order. If there aren't any vegetarian soup options available, they've always been willing to heat one up for me. Great Brueggers, my favorite bagels in the triangle.]
