[100761089748427274514,100259490081831457246,Food is generally good, service somewhat average. I asked for a small salad instead of fries or rice with my fish. The focus from the waiter was whether I would pay for the salad as an extra side. Really, is the cost significantly different? If the restaurant is full avoid it as there are far too many tables relative to the kitchen. You will wait forever for your meal.]
