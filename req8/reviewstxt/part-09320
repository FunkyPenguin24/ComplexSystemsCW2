[101451989935100281772,100656520449617293598,Cambodian Thai is hands down the best Thai restaurant in Michiana. They have a "spicy scale" of 1 - 10, and even the spiciest people I know max out around a seven there. Supposedly you can do a triple ten, but I am not that adventurous. If you are in the mood for something basic, you can't go wrong with the Pad See Ew or the Cashew Nuts with Chicken. The Panang Curry is great! They just expanded the restaurant from a place that seated around a dozen to around 80.]
