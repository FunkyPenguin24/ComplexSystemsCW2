[101392472938924278742,100947806963463177772,What a secret gem! Tired mom and daughter driving back to University of Oregon and we hit the wall at Roseburg. Trip Advisor led us here and we were so thankful. Fresh food and atmosphere like we enjoy in San Diego. Lucked out and enjoyed "Twice as nice Tuesday" specials and some Cupcake Chardonnay. Great service by Cheryl too. :)]
