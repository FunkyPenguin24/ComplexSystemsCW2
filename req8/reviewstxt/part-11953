[113900232471998420534,100798475049128874037,This was one of those places that you stumble upon, but are grateful that you did. We were driving through Monck's Corner, looking for somewhere for lunch that wasn't the same old McDonald's or Burger King. This place looked like the antithesis of fast food, so we stopped. Boy, were we glad! We had some excellent collards and butter beans while there, as well as the usual southern comfort food. The head waitress (? owner?) was hysterical, as was the woman manning the grill in the back corner. They were more than friendly, spending time entertaining our kids throughout our meal. We were even able to get some great tips from them (such as to visit the wonderful Mepkin Abbey nearby). The next day we were talking to our waiter and the chef at lovely Hominy Grill in Charleston about our fun experiences in the Carolinas. They were both familiar with the Howard Restaurant and couldn't believe that we'd stumbled on it. All in all, well worth a stop to experience some of the Low Country hospitality.]
