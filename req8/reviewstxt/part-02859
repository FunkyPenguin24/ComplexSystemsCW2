[108961385196024002946,100306321527182477695,As tourists in Cuiaba with an outdated guide book and limited Portuguese, we turned to Google places for advice. Tiered of buffet style food we opted for the highly rated Jap√¥ Restaurante. We weren't disappointed. The waiting staff, with their limited English and our two words in Portuguese, were helpful and professional. The food was great too. A delicious Brazilian-Japanese fusion. Popular Square is a trendy place to be on a Friday night in Cuiaba and we managed to stumble upon one of the 'places to be seen in'.]
