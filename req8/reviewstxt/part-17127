[104691832945321602513,101083046362441414516,Don't expect the ladies of El Taco to kiss your a$$ but do expect the best green chile smothering your burrito. I go for the Chorizo and egg, any time of the day! Al Pastor is great as well. Chile relleno burrito has a loyal following as well. The best Mexican food anywhere north of the border. GO!]
