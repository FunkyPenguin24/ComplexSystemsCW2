[115320954584409794310,100701747027332660949,Let me start off by saying how much I hate going to the doctor. I've never enjoyed the experience. That was until I met Dr. Schultz. He is a friendly and caring doctor that has gone out of his way to treat a difficult patient like me with care and respect. Because of this he is also the go to doctor for the majority of my extended family. He has taken time out of his schedule to visit my ailing father in law in his home just the check and see how he is doing. Those kind of services no longer exist. Those types of doctors are extremely difficult to find. I HIGHLY recommend Dr. Shultz and his practice to anyone in the area looking for an excellent family doctor.]
