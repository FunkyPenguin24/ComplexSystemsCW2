[107517977990931825861,100962626139485999074,I recently leased a car with you guys last August, and my car had a minor leak in it. It was the oil filter, and they were able to fix it at no cost for me and fast, which I thanked them immensely for, but the process to drop my car off on a weekend was horrible. I have never experienced where a service area was only half staffed on the weekends, and where I was told that I would need to "make other arrangements" to drop my car off during the week. Not only was he sarcastic with telling me this, but it was just really frustrating. I was really aggravated by this, and its unfortunate because I know of 2 people in my family that are looking for cars, and I will advise them to not go to Chevy because of this situation. I love my car, but this situation really had a negative impact on me.]
