[110889573459994298774,100121912547802872520,Joshua Frank and Frankly Focused did an amazing job capturing my daughter's unique personality for her high school senior pictures. Joshua found the perfect outdoor location and chose the ideal time of day for the shoot to maximize the beautiful natural lighting. My daughter is naturally shy but Joshua and his assistant quickly made her feel at ease and relaxed. It wasn't long into the shoot that we all could see her smile widen and brighten as she truly began to enjoy the process! Her photos turned out amazing! I'm scheduled with Joshua next month to take photos with my kids, this time at a unique indoor location....can't wait! I highly recommend Frankly Focused for all your professional photography needs!]
