[115739989054307011893,100771384989630481089,We moved to Missouri from the East Coast a year ago and Kato was the first sushi restaurant we found and tried. At first it was okay - not amazing, but good enough. I admit, I have pretty high standards coming from the coast with the fresh seafood variety and majorly impressive sushi establishments. As we've eaten at Kato over the last year, it has changed a lot. I'm not sure what is going on, -but- (1.) most of the nigiri I've ordered has been doused with lemon my past few orders (2.) I've had a few orders messed up (3.) the selection given with the sushi entrees have gone way downhill, forcing hubby and I to order piece by piece, which, of course, increases our bill by 30%. I hate to say it, but we're finally going to try somewhere new. Nice people, the staff has always been friendly, the place is relaxed and nice enough inside - but I wouldn't highly recommend it.]
