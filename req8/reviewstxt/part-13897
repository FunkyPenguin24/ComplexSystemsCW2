[113325287227612683473,100904950151928844248,Isha Mahan always does an awesome job. She cuts both my fiance's hair and mine and does equally great work with men's and women's styles. In the past I have been through quite a few stylists, but I think my salon-hopping days are over. Highly recommend!]
