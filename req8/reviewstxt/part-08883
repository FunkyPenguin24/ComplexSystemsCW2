[111203984599306914153,100632216100827590912,I use to stop here right before work every once in awhile. The last time I stopped by I asked for a breakfast wrap. I have ordered these before, they rarely take more than 10 minutes to make, most of the time it takes a little over 5 minutes. The guy that took my order made me feel uncomfortable, and when they handed me a wrap after 17 minutes they did not apologize for the wait. I was late for work, but that was more my fault for not just leaving and bolting for work when i realized that there was no time. But seriously I will not be coming back there for food. There was a guy with glasses there, I liked him but I don't see him there anymore... sad.]
