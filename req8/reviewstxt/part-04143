[113768605204829262311,100378189616338080221,I've had more mail lost or delivered late (in some cases, months later) than any other post office I've ever dealt with. The final straw was this past Valentine's Day weekend. My husband ordered a surprise gift from me on amazon, which was supposedly "delivered" Saturday, according to the tracking information. Nevermind the fact that I was outside when the mail ran and only found the usual stuff in the mail that day. Nevermind the fact that I called them this morning, and was asked if I wanted a re-delivery, whatever THAT is. And nevermind the fact that once again, I just watched my mailman drop a couple of envelopes into my box, minus the delivery. WHY would you update tracking info without actually delivering anything? Are they thieves, liars, or just plain lazy?]
