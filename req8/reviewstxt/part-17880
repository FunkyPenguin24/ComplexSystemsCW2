[113284009130040336321,101123130706771760304,I would give them no stars if possible. I bought a 2010 Mazda 3S from them on October 12th. The finance department messed up our paperwork, so after having had the car for a month, we still didn't have financing. We tried to return the car, but were told we had had it too long. I called my credit union, which was what I wanted to do at the beginning and they talked me out of it, and got my own financing. It has now been 2.5 months and I still do not have a permanent tag and my second temporary tag expires today. I was promised that my tag would be here yesterday, called this morning and they told me it's at the tag office which is closed until Monday, meaning I can't drive to work Monday or to the tag office. They say they can't give me another temp tag because the real tag is available. Really!? And I agree with the other reviewer regarding Adrian. He's a rude, arrogant bully. They need to replace him with someone who has some people skills.]
