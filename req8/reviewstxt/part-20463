[101298704576845538097,100084315083051160889,I had my heating and a/c units replaced by CP heating & AC. It's a small company, you deal directly with the owner Doug. I found him very responsive. The work was done promptly and all my concerns satisfied. He is cost conscious and does not gold plate his bids. I would use him again for any future HVAC work I might need.]
