[106612339248000927944,100974548474153530861,1 star is too many for this place. I went there last night for a burger and a beer and had the worst restaurant experience of my life. I arrived around 5:40 and was greeted at the door by an obviously less than happy hostess. All she had to do was fake a smile for a few seconds then to one offered to show me to a table despite there being several waitresses standing around in a mostly empty restaurant. I walked over to the bar assuming that I could get some quicker service there. I sat and ordered my beer and asked for a menu. The bartender opened a tab for me, got my beer and told me about the Happy Hour specials. I had made my decision within 5 minutes and waited for the bartender to return to ask what I wanted to eat. She never came back. After finishing my beer I was asked if I wanted another and before the word No was even completely out of my mouth she walked off. For the next hour I sat there without a beer or food in front of me. Another bartender eventually did ask me if I wanted something to drink I said no I was trying to close my tab. After another 10 minute wait she got back to me with my check. She gave me my check and asked if I only got 1 beer. I replied that I had been waiting for almost an hour and half for someone to take my food order and she asked me if I still wanted to order. No I wasn't willing to wait for food, and I left. If they didn't have my Credit Card info I would have left long before.]
