[115496712775133210018,100146924433762745074,Janice Seney David Kruger is a great dentist ..... very little to no pain. I really appreciate his knowledge and wisdom and skill in the area of Dental Care. I could go to another dentist closer to where I live but I consider it worth my time and dental health to travel a distance to use David Kruger as my dentist.]
