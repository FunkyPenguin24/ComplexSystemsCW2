They told my sons girlfriend, who is 19 by the way, that her dad would have to pay for some of her school as a parent, that everyone qualifies for financial aid, that they work with her for payments, acted like they are so sweet, helpful and she was going to have no problems. They take potential students on a tour of the facility, have really fun music playing, they stop and dance... oh they lay it on thick and get these young kids hooked on what seems like a very fun learning environment with faculty that bends over backwards to help them out. What a joke. The day before school started, they told her that she did not qualify for financial aid, glossed over the fact that some of her tuition was going to be paid by student loans and really took advantage of her youth and inexperience with financial matters. BTW, it was over $17k for a 9-month program. She realized she couldn't afford the school and dropped out after two months. She tried to setup a payment arrangement with them and they wouldn't work with her at all.]
