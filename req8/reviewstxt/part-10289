[103179350311622434767,100710130396598735215,I was so embarassed at 39 years old I needed braces! I had spoke with other Orthodontics who tried to persuade me to try Invisiline. Iam grateful I didn't. Not only did I feel a bit too old for braces, I also drink alot of coffee; which has left me with a stained retainer. I had been a client of Dr. Gardner when Dr. Niepraschk took over the practice. He holds great credentionals and I knew Dr. Gardner had spent a great amount of time searching for the right person to take his place. I was very amazed how Linda and Dr. Niepraschk didn't 'miss a beat' during my visits. The new Dr. explained everthing about my treatment plan, and shared other innovative methods. My teeth are finally free from braces! I loved the way I felt when visiting! It was just like visiting friends! And the best part was how everyone collaborated with each other regarding the client's needs. If you don't like your smile, I know just the team to help! I toast to everyone who works in the office! They did an exemplary job! Sincerely, Cheryl McWhorter]
