[100098587925550139522,100538742467477980414,This is a magical shrine embedded within a small slice of ancient forest. I lived in Maebashi as an English teacher and coming here was by far the most amazing experience I had during my time here. By the way, the website given above links to a different Akagi Shrine; this one is often called the Miyosawa Akagi Shrine to differentiate from the more well known one on top of Mt. Akagi.]
