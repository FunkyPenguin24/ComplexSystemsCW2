[106204126745642319026,101062933082203372454,My very first car was a Nissan and still to this day, Nissan is the only car I've ever owned. I bought my 08' Altima brand new with 0 miles on it and was very VERY upset when my transmission started having problems before 100,000. With the economy being the way that it is, adding a car payment wasn't in our best interested and pricing it out to have my transmission fixed made me sick to my stomach. When I bought my car, 5 years ago, I didn't buy the 100,000 extra warranty because I never had a problem with any of my other 4 Nissans. My husband and I just decided we would drive it until it died and go from there, rather than putting it in the shop and spending money that we didn't have. A few days later, I was driving to Gainesville and out of the blue, I called the service department for a reason I'm still not sure of. I guess just to see if anything might have been recalled by chance. The receptionist immediately transferred me to "Kevin" who was an answer to my prayers. He told me Nissan had a 120,000 mile drivetrain warrenty that I had NO IDEA about. He set me up an appointment for the following morning. I brought my car in, it took MAYBE 20 minutes for them to determine it was in fact my transmission, they gave me a rental car and called me less than 24 hours later to let me know my car was ready to be picked up. I spent MAYBE a full hour, both days at the dealership and didn't pay a single cent for anything. I STILL CAN NOT believe it. The guys (and ladies) in the service department were SO helpful and friendly and did they're very best to get us in and out as quick as possible. They treated us the same way they would have wanted to been treated if the rolls were flipped, not like they were trying to make money off of us or like we weren't important because the warranty covered us. I can't say enough nice things about the service department. I'm BEYOND impressed with them and because of that, I'll never take my cars anywhere else!]
