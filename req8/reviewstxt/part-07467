[116242663043245242690,100559214348311107190,I was shopping around for antiques,jewerly, and some electronics. I wanted a bargain for anything if I decided to buy it. Well I was immediately suprised by the comfortable atmosphere. Most pawn shops a customer does not get that feel right at home feeling, buy dynasty pawn definately did. The store inventory was great quality for an extremely good price. Carlos and Miguel were great at helping me decide on what I'm going to buy, and also educate me on how and to get gem stones for a custom design piece of jewlery. I could not believe how low the prices were. A long term buisness relationship is going to develope after my first time in there shop. On the loan portion of the buisness I could tell these guys would definately give a more than good offer on anything brought in for a loan. They would because it would make the customer happy, and they would want to come back for future purchasing and loans. I plan on bringing some items that I want to sell, and I would absolutely trust there offer. Best pawn shop I have ever been too]
