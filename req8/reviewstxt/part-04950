[100053880840183405794,100420786887499992009,Went to dinner two hours before Les Mis at the Erie Playhouse. Our dinners took a long time to come out. When they did my wife's steak salad was missing. Apparently the computer went down and orders were missing. The owner ( I presume) explained that to us a few times. I thought, isn't that why a waitress writes down orders? As the orders came out my daughter's steak Madagascar was so rare that I would say it was raw. The owner (again I presume the owner) said "That looks a little rare." So it went back for a little touch up. Now my daughter eats steak rare. What came back was not even pink anywhere. I suppose this is what most people would call medium or better yet medium well. I would have had her send it back but we would have never made the play. Mind you we gave ourselves two hours. My order was grilled chicken breast with brie, apples and bacon. If you are going to charge $17 for one small chicken breast it better knock your socks off. Well, it was not tender, there were a few apples and pieces of bacon. Comparable to something out of a Stouffers frozen food box. Oh, and before I forget, I hate getting my salad dressing served in a plastic cup that I need to take the lid off. Nothing home made about that! At the end of the meal, no time for desert, our waitress chuckled about the snafu with my wife's meal and said, "Well, at least you got a free drink out of it!" I don't know what free drink she was talking about becasue we were charged for everything. Which sort of surprised me, now don't misunderstand, I did not want a free drink, what I wanted was a good dining experience with exceptional food. I had neither.]
