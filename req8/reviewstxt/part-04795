[112350881209691482223,100413063507293483807,Good pizza, did not skimp on the ingredients. Not a complaint, but the crust is chewy soft all the way through, and I do prefer a bit of a crunch to the crust with a soft center. (perhaps brush with olive oil or sprinkle with water). But that is just a texture preference. It is more pricey, but you get what you pay for. You want cheap go to little ceasers and get a crust made from the same material as the box it comes in.]
