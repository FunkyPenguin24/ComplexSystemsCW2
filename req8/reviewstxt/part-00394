[109293981320285571226,100179538943267339879,music depends on the day, price of drinks is acceptable (5euros/drink, 6euros Mojito). Really tasty and refreshing Mojito. I've been there 3-4 times. The place has a unique character, colourful, and alternative. Definitely one of the bars i like going when I go out in Amsterdam. Open also during day, and there are a lot of workshop, etc. Visit their site, they usually have a music happening, etc.]
