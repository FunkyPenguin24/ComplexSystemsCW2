[100198930277485884784,100701566750979824637,This review is actually about Prescription Solutions, Inc - somehow tied to United Health Care. Prescription Solutions is terrible - the worst mail order pharmacy company I have ever used, AND its the ONLY mail order pharmacy I have ever been forced into using by an insurance company. I was told last month to call back the following day to process my refill because they were upgrading their system. Then, when I called the following day, I asked if they could get my script in the mail that day because I had only one pill left. They told me that wouldn't be possible that they were 2-3 days behind and that maybe i should call in earlier. I would've, if I would've received my reminder from their "reminder service." I asked why I did not receive a reminder last month and I was told some people fell through the cracks due to system upgrades and that ultimately its my responsibility. I agree, but then don't tell me to call back tomorrow and then when I do call, tell me you're 2-3 days backlogged. TERRIBLE TERRIBLE COMPANY AND CUSTOMER SERVICE. The only thing this company is good at in my opinion is delaying delivery of prescriptions to patients. My guess is some highly paid accountant has figured out how much the company saves/makes if they delay each person calling in to refill by a day... If I wasn't FORCED by UNITED HEALTH CARE to use this company, I'd be long gone, but this is the only way united will pick up my script. What United and Prescription solutions (more like Prescriptions Delayed, Inc) are doing should be illegal. Anyone know of any class actions or recourse that can be taken? If each of us speaks out, then maybe we can get what we pay for, or at least hurt their stock price!!]
