[113964718045216118845,100446047370889383583,This was a very bad first experience with this place. I called them to schedule an oil change appointment and durning the phone call I asked the representative that I'd like to skip giving the address part so I don't get lots of mails from them. Then he just became an a-hole about the whole thing and starting being so rude. He made it seem that they have no openings that day (even though I called early in the morning) and threw me to the next day. Had to cancel and choose another dealer place.]
