[102279424086090448806,100735121851388479944,Dr. Ern is outstanding. I need a lot of work and I only just started with him. Can't wait to see the end results since the temporary work is so fine, right out of their on-site lab with no waiting. The practice staff is wonderful too. Everyone is so considerate. MaryAnn, Mo, Marie - taking all the time I need to be comfortable about what are to me very important decisions. I can't thank them enough for making all this so easy and pain-free. Everyone - especially Dr. Ern - thank you so very very much.]
