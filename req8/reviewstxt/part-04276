[107229032850626771114,100385801305938507498,Dr. Scott is amazing! My 5 year old Yorkie had some major dental issues. I went to one vet in Houston that didn't want to take the case and wanted to send me to a pet dentist - which would have cost $1,500+. Dr. Scott saw my dog and had no worries about doing the surgery and even worked with me to make sure it wasn't crazy expensive. The staff was great and called me immediately after the surgery to update me and to follow up the next day to make sure she was healing ok. She genuinely wants the best for your pets but understands not everyone can afford to an expensive vet bill. I will 100% be going back and telling all my friends to go here.]
