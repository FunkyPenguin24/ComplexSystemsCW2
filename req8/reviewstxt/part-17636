[114098581759258017556,101110971783345889079,My oldest son recently completed his orthodontic treatment at RTO. They have been fantastic, every step of the way. From early screening and braces-on, to checkups and fixes, to braces-off and aftercare, I have been delighted with their friendly and compassionate approach to orthodontic care. RTO makes appointments fun and pleasant for patients and parents alike. All this, and they do great work too!]
