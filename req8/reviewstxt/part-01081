[117634083940605690518,100214834392143913866,My now husband and I eloped in New Orleans in October, and the only aspect of the experience I really cared about was the photography. I did an extensive search for a photographer that fit my criteria: fair prices, beautiful photographs with a more artistic flair than the run-of-the-mill wedding portraiture, and some evidence of satisfaction from former clients. Pamela turned out to be exactly that. She is a quirky, energetic, and vibrant woman who takes amazing photographs! I booked a boudoir session before the ceremony as a gift to my husband, and then Pamela and her very helpful assistant accompanied us across the river to the Algiers Courthouse. She was nothing but professional, and kept me relaxed and laughing even in my skivvies. Furthermore, Pamela and her assistant were extraordinarily helpful: they served as our witnesses, helped us navigate the city a bit, gave us suggestions for fun things to do, and even ran to an ATM to get our license fee when we found out the courthouse only accepted cash! Pamela turned the photographs around very quickly, and they're absolutely marvelous. I am so glad that I made the decision to book Pamela for my photography: I have some priceless treasures that will keep me smiling for years to come.]
