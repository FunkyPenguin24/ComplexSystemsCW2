[102255843153454632046,100972492593485960090,Ok, where to start! The people are nice, staff is great. Rooms are terrible, bed is totaly uncomfortable, and appears to be like 20 years old. Then matresses have plastic on them, as if a 6 year old is going to pee the bed! Not good. The shower is terrible and mine leaked so as soon as I turned the bath water on, my head got wet. The shower curtin moves and you have no room to move around. They hold a charge on your credit card for incidentals, but they have none! Well ok, a bag of chips $1.00 Soda $1.25 and Bottle Water $1.50 WAY over priced. Breakfast was terrible, but it was free. The paint job was terrible and I can keep going. The best part was the price, cheep and I got what I paid for a TERRIBLE hotel room.]
