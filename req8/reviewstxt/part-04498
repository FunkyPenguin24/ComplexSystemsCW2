[102170722513318064748,100398215377815776940,I've been a few times to Cook and Pan for lunch and it has been really good. Although they have a menu, they will mix and match things as everything is made on the spot. The place has improved inside quite considerably. They have redecorated it. If you like Polish or Eastern European food or even if you just like a really good breakfast it is worth a visit. There really isn't much else like it so like a lot of niche restaurants, they probably aren't making much money at it and so it is important to support it less it be lost. Their perogies and cabbage rolls are in a different league to the stuff you get everywhere else.]
