[111616516226458347805,100071443041111926788,BUYER BEWARE!!! BUYER BEWARE!!! We traded in a $11000 car with $7000 left to pay on it. They said they would pay our loan off and take the trade in for another car. Its been 3 months and they still have not paid off the loan. In the meantime we are sitting here getting harassing phone calls from our lender saying they have not received a payment. On top of that, the motor of the car that we got from them blew up in less than a month. They said they would fix it for $1500, so we got everything in order to get it fixed and now they're saying it will be more. Needless to say, we are done with them and we're not paying anything else. They've ruined our credit and now we are without a car. We're still dealing with this headache and they are not cooperating. They are crooks and con artists in the business of ripping people off.]
