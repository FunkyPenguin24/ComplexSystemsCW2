[117866004347363065367,100032910687341697426,We had a really awesome time with Vantage Yacht Club going up and down different branches of the Chicago River. The captain was fun and accommodating and it's a night that we're still talking about more than a year later. I would highly recommend renting one of these boats AND hiring a captain. Worth every penny.]
