[113013591640686304975,100404997333093672895,I called in today to see about scheduling my appointment for breast augmentation and I was hung up on 3 times - the day I initially went; the receptionist didn't even acknowledge that I was there until a couple minutes afterward and I was standing in front of her. I understand that they give a good price and I've heard that the doctor is really good but I feel like you don't treat patients or future patients like that - Teresa who is the person I met with was awesome...she was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions - she didn't hurry me and took her time answering all my questions and honestly makes you feel comfortable with the decision but the attention that the front desk people took in helping me wasn't very good - even if I did get surgery and I called in because I had an issue or of a concern that I wasn't feeling well and I got hung up three times; to me that is frustrating. I thought I would email because it is something that could be improved - other than that...Teresa was awesome and of great help for the knowledge she has.]
