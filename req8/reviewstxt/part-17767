Boston cream pie and key lime pie it was all great. The owners are from Rhode Island and the seafood we ate was tagged from Massachusetts. It is a small spot in a plaza but it is worth it. They are expanding, in February they will have 150 seating capacity. If you love seafood and want to eat in a relaxed atmosphere this is the place.]
