[116091916146684376547,101060311837654179288,We were there in the beginning of July 2012. The hotel itself is beautiful and the surrounding gardens and landscaping are very nice as well. The food was ok (not too great). The swimming pool was great. The only bad thing is that it should have a convenience store close by or even inside the hotel. If you need to buy something as simple as tooth paste, or Aspirin there is nothing nearby. The closest stores are at Coco Beach which is like 30min away from the hotel. Other than that it was good.]
