[116026644307497156907,100506638779337431667,My boyfriend took a job with these people. Everyone in the area loved him and called him all the time for rides. Said he was THE friendliest cabbie ever. Metro is so worried about lining their pocket they make it impossible for cabbies to make a dime! They kept shutting his comp down for 'unpaid lease' and he was giving them almost everything he had. He had a call from a customer he had the previous day and got in the cab and his comp had been shut down. This guy needed a ride to the airport (a GOOD fare for him). He was obligated to the customer and took him on his own dime. He called the 'shop' and told them what happened and they told him to bring the cab back. He was fired! I know good, honest and friendly cabs are rare, shame they let him go when he gave them a GOOD name!]
