[100717211835674900659,100477441938607684195,Had no problems with the service or other staff. Food was prompt and delicious. The ceviche is absolutely the best item on the menu. Camarones Borrachos are a fantastic shrimp dish with a chipolte pepper and sauce. Only problem was that we had the peel the shrimp. Definitely not your run of the mill Mexican Restaurant. We enjoyed it so much the first day we came back the next.]
