[103966506395616396267,100150449038117213071,Sub-Par. How hard is it to cook a steak really? Decided to visit this place for a birthday lunch. What a mistake. The staff have no interest in serving you. In fact you feel like you are a inconvenience to their day. The place had 4 tables and a few other bar guests. No very busy. Perhaps that should have been an indicator for us. After ordering some meals A Sub Cheese Burger $19, Fish & Chips $20 and a $29 Rump steak Medium Rare with nothing else but a sauce on the side. After making a point about the sauce on the side it arrived smothered in it, When asked to have it without the sauce was greeted with an indignant response. The Steak was then returned 10 min later (same Steak) When it was cut into it was well done, very well done. After attempting to attract a wait staff. We decided to take the steak back to the kitchen opening. Needless to say that the kitchen staff huffed their irritation. No apology no acknowledgment nothing. By this stage the other guests were 2/3rds through their meal. When I approached the wait staff about it they seemed completely put out. At this point I suggested that they refund me for the steak. Still no apology just "sooo you like don't want the steak?" Once our guests finished their meals (They were not very impressed with their meals ether.) We ordered 2 more beers and 2 coffees. One coffee eventually arrived 12 min after the first. This place looks like it has possibility nice expensive decor. The owners clearly have style. It is a pity they have the most disengaged staff. Perhaps its a representation of the leadership or just really bad atypical Canberra service. Congratulations Sub-Urban. You truly are sub par in every way. Avoid this place if you want a good experiance]
