[105363698456320150618,101138082807000904071,Cracked my list of top 5 worst dining experiences, I can only hope this restaurant goes out of business soon. I'll leave out the minor details but atmosphere was cluttered and tacky, service was terrible, and the food was a poor copy of BWW. The wings were small and about a third were broken with sharp bone shards. The flavors were extremely lacking. All four flavors I tried were not on par with other wing joints and I had to send one order of Cajun back because the spice combination and oil dousing made it inedible (first time I've done that in a while). Each order of (6) wings took a solid 20 mins to come out on their all you can eat night. This may be why I heard a manager flipping out in the back above the noise of the FOH. Plus I never did get that ranch I asked for twice. I could go on but I think I got my point across.]
