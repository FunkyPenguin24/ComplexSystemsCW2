[100055412810767881550,101061320192358525184,After spending a weekend at the Rock River Riders motorcycle hillclimb across the street, my boys and I hopped over to white pines for a moment of serenity and were not disappointed. The creek crossings on our way to the lodge proved a novel cause for celebration. The well maintained campsites on a beautifully sculpted landscape left us yearning for more. Hopefully we'll be afforded the privilege of camping there in the not too distant future.]
