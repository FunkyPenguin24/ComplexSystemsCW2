[106972296029708696633,100605905198467292810,Coming from South Africa, my wife and I were tired of the sity life of New York, LA and San Fran. So we chose to catch the bus to the Golden Gate Park. What a great choice. If i lived in San Francisco, this would be the place i would spend most weekends, either chilling by the many waterways, sleeping on the grass, or playing soccer with my team (i would have to make a team, but they didn't look too good, so that should be easy!). We took a walk through the park, all the way to the beach, which was around 5miles, but 5 great miles. If you are ever in San Francisco, best you take a weekend day to check it all out!\\oh, and there's a really cool Japanese Garden there too!]
