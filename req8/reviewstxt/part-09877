[115137599324697784048,100686707143228684966,I went to Tameron Hyundai today with the intention of viewing a used Hyundai I found online. I was pleased to work with Corey Hooper who worked with me and showed me all of the options they had available. When I decided on a new Hyundai Sonata, he and the rest f the Tameron team worked with me to get me the car I wanted for the price I wanted. I recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase a car.]
