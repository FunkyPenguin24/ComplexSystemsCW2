[102483157761930909850,100780875307567951251,He was great!! :) My engine light came on and he got me in the day after I made the appointment. He was honest and pretty fair. I have a 2010 VW TDI and he knew how to take care of her, its not easy finding a mechanic that knows how to work on German cars. My engine needed a glow plug replaced, it was suppose to take an hour but it only took him 30 minutes and he adjusted the quoted price and gave me a break on the installation of the glow plug because it didn't take him as long. Plus he replaced the battery in my fob and replaced a blown fuse for pretty cheap. He even showed me the glow plug that he was putting in, pretty cool. He charges less for labor then the dealers,and he was very reasonable on the parts. I was very impressed with my experience, he even let me go back into the shop to show me the filters that he was replacing. He took great care of my car. :) While I was waiting a gentleman came in and asked if he worked on Mercedes he told the gentleman that He doesn't work on Mercedes, but he will tell you that up front so he didn't waste his money or his time. The guy is pretty good and he is pretty honest. I recommend him to all my friends and anyone who has a VW, Audi, Mini, or BMW's. :)]
