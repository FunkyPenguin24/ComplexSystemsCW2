[103373587928047878032,100534040016655656583,Swapping propane tanks at Home Depot costs twice as much as re-filling tanks at Expo Propane. And you lose money when you do the swaps! I do not know of any place cheaper than $1.99 per gallon and Mike was a great help educating me about the tank expiration. I will also be bringing in my rv! They have me as a lifetime customer!]
