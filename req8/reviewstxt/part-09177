[103171337388939018312,100648221377249428783,I normally don't write reviews, but I've a bone to pick with Brad's review below. He feels that Sam's Bar-B-Q should serve more meats than pork and sausage. Seriously, Bradshaw's BBQ on the other side of Gunter serves only pulled pork, not even sausage and they use the label 'BBQ'. Sam's more than deserves their name. He also feels that Sam's fare is 'nothing fancy', but he's too short-sighted to realize that 'nothing fancy' is perfectly acceptable of Bar-B-Q and that a butt doesn't need to be over-spiced with some crazy blend of rub to be amazing. Why Brad seems to think that high schoolers working at a small Ma-and-Pa restaurant is a bad thing, I have no idea. Expecting a small, hometown hole-in-the-wall restaurant to employ only adults is discrimination and just illogical. There's only so many places for high schoolers to work and Sam's is just a good of a place as any. His opinion of sausage is his own. Their sausage is just like any other sausage. He's nitpicking, trying to find something wrong where there's nothing wrong. He thinks their beans are mushy. Reality check: that's how beans are when they're cooked. I've been stationed at Gunter since 2010 and we eat out at Sam's at least once a month and I can tell you this: their pork is great, most of the fat is separated right before it goes on your plate, the sausage is delicious, and their fries are fresh, crispy, and piping hot. This is a consistent thing that's been going on for years. Having a high schooler run your cash register or separate fat from meat is not going to ruin your meal. Get off your high horse and enjoy some friggin' pig.]
