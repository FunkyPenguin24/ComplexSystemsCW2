[106259121554625001725,100086230594188302990,I don't give out negative feedback lightly, in fact this is the only time I have taken the time to rate anything negatively online. That being said, TR Lawing are the slumlords of Charlotte and have proven their status over and over again. With cheap, temporary fixes to major problems and general disregard toward those that are under contract with them, these cats just don't care. They give swift call-backs to work order requests under the guise of taking care of the issue swiftly, but you find yourself waiting all day for the promised work to be completed. When someone finally does show up, you are lucky to have an actual solution worked out. Typically it is some cheap fix. We moved out of our last place in order to get away from TR Lawing, but they ended up buying our building anyway. The issues that we have brought to their attention have received NO work, nor have they addressed us about any of it. Currently I am sitting with no AC because of work their guys did on another unit. Somehow they managed to bust mine up and not return to fix it. I called this morning to have them come back out and take care of their mistake.... it is now 5pm. Guess our already breezy windows will have to stay open tonight... Avoid if at all possible]
