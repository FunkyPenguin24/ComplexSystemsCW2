[106611261507765097720,100526812713526506271,Josh Lehmann actually picked up the phone at 7:25 am when i called. I was expecting to just leave a message, head to work, and maybe receive a call back from them later that day. The service has been top notch. My wife and I are optometrists and understand service is key to loyal patients/customers. I have been very pleased with their response time and matt faughnder has been great on the job at our house. Definitely will recommend!!]
