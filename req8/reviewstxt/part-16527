[108139732557363697512,101048390003927814353,I usually write restaurant reviews, but my resolution this year is to branch out of my comfort zone and do things i've never before; like review my experience with a dealership. It started with a phone call. Baby steps. I needed a water pump, so I called _____ auto parts place (with an Irish surname) and they put me on hold. After 5 minutes I hung up. They must have been busy. I googled a dealer and TSD didn't put me on hold. Don't know if they were busy or not. I shouldn't have to.]
