[105986257667388272573,100411333034464950412,Service was fine, food was aweful. Had to go home to grill my panini because the cheese was not melted, not even warm! Hardly any grill marks on the outside. VERY disappointing, The breakfast oatmeal bar was nearly burnt and really hard to bite into. I had to dunk it in coffee to not break my teeth on it! I usually go to the Wendy's by my work in Natomas. Will stick to them since their food is always hot, fresh and delish.]
