[103587625836602072303,100617876582672967695,Fantastic place for kids of all ages. Loads of pools to choose from, great kids club. Rooms cleaned daily and towels changed. Evening entertainment leaves a lot to be desired and there's nothing to do after 11pn when the bar closes but all in all a great hotel. Need to be careful on the beach though as it's full of jellyfish]
