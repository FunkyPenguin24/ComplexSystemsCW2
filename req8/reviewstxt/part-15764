[103582430957715259968,101008014988309932127,Very friendly, helpful staff that do not mind spending time with you as you struggle to make a purchasing decision. It's a small store, but keeps decent stock. They will order you anything you need- I just recently got a Mossberg 500 barrel for less than anything I could find online. Other area gun stores are driving prices up, but this shop has not. Gun, accessory, and ammo prices are reasonable (with a few really great deals) for the stock on hand. They don't tack on all kinds of hidden charges either. This local gun store has done well enough to get all my business that I had previously done on the internet.]
