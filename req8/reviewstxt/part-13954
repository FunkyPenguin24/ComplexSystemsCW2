[103011893186163616677,100908870691313634631,Pros: cheap fare, no wait (yet), cozy and welcoming ambiance Cons: Menu is mostly sandwiches, even though the space is like a restaurant. I wish they'd do a traditional breakfast (biscuits, omelettes, etc.). It would bring me in there a lot more! They really put out a home-cooked meal vibe. I haven't tried enough of their pastries/desserts, but I hear they are delicious.]
