[116568915109983796532,100566991459673121139,Pejman was recommended to me by a colleague and I am very thankful for the referral. I had been trying a new salon every few months for the past couple of years since moving to the GTA and was always unpleasantly surprised by the service and result. My first visit to Pejman's (and every visit since), he took time to consult regarding the exact colour and style that I have in mind, as well as frustrations I've had regarding hair damage and my hair type. He made recommendations according to my situation and always puts my vision and needs first. I've been to Pejman 4 times now in the past year and I won't go anywhere else. He helps work on long-term goals for hair health and growth, while always maintaining my ideal colour and style. I would highly recommend Pejman, especially to blondes who are tired of having hairdressers damage and over-process their hair. He is also great at adding subtle lo-lights to create a more natural-looking and sophisticated colour. Thank you very much Pejman! See you soon.]
