[108137654085130682042,100923375930929911174,We arrived legoland at 1030am and the return coach was planned at 5PM, initially were worrying the return bus might be too early however later found us absolutely wrong about that: we finished all the rides before 12 noon and craving to go home, end up we took a 2 hour nap in Burger King. Pros: cheap, not crowded. Cons: weather too hot and no shelter, park very small not many rides, photos are too expensive (50rm each). This park is meant for kids.]
