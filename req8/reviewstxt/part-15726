[113999080843168379185,101006391053982911412,In my opinion, this is by far the best sushi place in Spokane. The food is consistently outstanding. To start, my wife and I love the chicken lettuce wraps. I love their Pearl and Red Dragon rolls and I always order some sashimi as well. Always excellent! My kids (6 and 8) also love coming here. Service has always been very good for us. We have also ordered the food as take out on multiple occasions. The food is well packaged for the ride home -- no complaints. Unlike others on this post, I have never had a bad experience there and my family has probably visited this spot around 15 times now.]
