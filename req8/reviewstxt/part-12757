[100930940226968300145,100843365604126019647,4.6.2013, times atteneded, 9:30, 10:30, ages of party, 33-27. lane 35, conservative & non-conservative patrons Pros: Cleanliness, Staff was friendly, non-smoking, availability of lanes Cons: Here we go 1.) While the staff was friendly, and there were plenty of customer service reps working behing the counter (cashiers, shoe staff, managers, etc), they took forever to say "May I help you". They all stood around, walked around like they had a million things to do, and no one wanted to help. The "big boss" (In a blue shirt), NEVER looked at anyone and told them to get a move on. I've worked in customer service for may years. You don't do this. It's one thing to employ teenagers. It's another to employ them, and NOT tell them to do their job - wait on customers. 2.) Price: $5.00 a game? Plus $4.00 shoe rental. You must be kidding me. 1 hour of bowling, and shoe rental for 4 people for people was $49.99. I'm not my father talking about bread as a nickel, but $50 for 5 people for 1 hour??? 3.) Be careful if you play by game or by hour. I got sold on 2 games for 1 hour. What they DON'T tell you is you only get a 5 minute grace period to get a ball and a drink (water, soda, alcohol, etc). Unless you IMMEDIATELY start bowling, and you're on top of it, you won't get 2 games in with their timer. Don't even think about a bathroom break. 4.) My party of 4 got through the 1st game and 7 frames of the 2nd game before the "timer" counted down to zero. We went out as a Saturday night outing (one pitcher of beer, two girly drinks for our wives, and 4 weak shots for whoever got a strike). Before the counter struck zero (about 8 minutes left) I went to the counter asking if we could extend our game to the end of the 10th frame. I was politely told no, that people were waiting. LESS THAN 5 MINUTES AFTER OUR "TIMER" HIT ZEZO, A REPRESENTATIVE STOPPED BY TO TELL US THEY NEEDED TO GIVE OUR LANE TO ANOTHER PARTY, AND WE NEEDED TO LEAVE. A minute after that, a manager (who wore a black, long sleeve shirt), stalked my lane (as we were putting on our shoes, putting our balls away, and finishing our drinks (the original pitcher of beer & water we ordered), and as soon as we left, attacked our lane with a ferocity of a velociraptor attacking the cow in Jurassic Park (It had 6 glasses, and 4 shot glasses). 5.) I will NEVER give my money to that bowling alley again. Maybe it's because I come from a small county in Ohio where people respect your patronage. This bowling alley ONLY wants your money, and it's managed by men/women who don't care about their jobs. I'm 33 and felt like my 91 year old grandfather complaining how things aren't like they used to be - when people used to care about you, and your money was well spent. It was a sad moment. I will NOT go back there.]
