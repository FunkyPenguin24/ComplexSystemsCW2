[102147367203115095880,100463673064690052311,We recently bought a used Honda Accord at Victory Honda, the sales people made the buying experience painless and quick, and delivered on every word they promised. We financed through our credit union and the dealer had no issues working with them. We were in and out in around 2hrs, and even let us drive the Accord home and to the bank before handing them the check. The entire experience felt like we were buying a new car. The Accord had several scratches and dents, so my wife took it into the service department and they were able to repair all the issues, even a large dent on the trunk. She said the service department wasn't as friendly as the sales department, and she had to carry our daughter, plus a large car seat to the parking lot while looking for her car, and no one offered to help. However they did an exceptional work on the repairs, the car looks brand new.]
