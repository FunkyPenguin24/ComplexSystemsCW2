[100119454594159681645,100565439888732373215,My husband and I went to this store to inquire about phone cases for two units we had with us. After looking at their minimal display and not seeing a case for our particular phone models, I asked the clerk working there. The first thing out of his mouth when asking if he had cases for a Motorola Droid Ultra was "Oh those are old phones..." Insulting the customer is not really the best way to go about "helping" them. My husband then asked, "So why are you still selling these phones if you are no longer offering any accessories for them?" His response was, "Good Question..." End of conversation! We just purchased our phones so this comment was an immediate turn off. He never even offered to have something ordered in for us or to assist us further. Thanks for the great experience, I'll be ordering my next accessory from eBay or Amazon and skip the poor customer service.]
