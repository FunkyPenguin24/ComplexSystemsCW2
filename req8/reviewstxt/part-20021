When I came in to buy a new professional Bach trumpet we set down and came up with a configuration that best suited me and then they got Bach to ship them one of the same bore and bell size for me to try out before I placed the order for a custom one. The great service continued after my purchase even. I came in and asked what was the best thing to polish the horn was and they gave me a almost $10 polishing cloth. Didn't want any payment for it. This is by far the best music store in Macon, in both quality of service and goods.]
