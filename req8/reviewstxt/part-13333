[115286723524918627862,100875642368145916202,Hi I've known Andy for over two years. He is a total professional and makes the workouts fun but also very hard or I wouldn't still be going! No matter what the circumstances Andy always has a smile but don't be fooled he makes you work! I hated sport with a passion and was a bit of a couch potato but I knew like we all do that this wasn't a recipe for a healthy life style so I bit the bullet and got started and I have no regrets I'm fitter know that I have ever been..........don't wait thinking I don't want people to see me exercising pick the phone up and ring it's your body after all if you think you could do more exercise don't be embarrassed just call.]
