[100293775196397412379,100275945778624166627,No customer service or age discrimination... I'm a 25 yr old looking to buy my 2nd car after paying off my first. Camebto look at some trucks. When I walked inside no one greeted with all the employees just hanging out and talking toeach other I proceeded outside with my wife and son. When I saw someone I asked about a truck with no response he turned and walked away. When i saw about 5 employees hanging out at a car. After about 15 minutes of looking at the collection of trucks and suv's and not being able to sit inside any I left. I am now at a ford dealer considering a new f150 THANKS CAR MAX.]
