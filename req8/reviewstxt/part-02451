[100022322467789904557,100285189534331117001,I recently purchased a family car from Diss Car Centre. The service that I received from Rob was really friendly, helpful and in my opinion honest. He also gave me a fair price for the trade in of my old car. Being a small town I did a little word of mouth with some friends that had purchased from him and they could only praise him up. One of his customers did have a problem with her car, however she said that Diss Car Centre dealt with it exceptionally well and she praises them up for dealing with her problem so well. When I need a new car I know where I will be going first next time.]
