[114561738115859876671,100442340673661657129,I called about my gen one EVO screen going dark all of sudden. Greg was very helpful in letting me know that they had the LCD part in stock and that it would take about an hour to repair and that they had some availability that day. I mentioned when I was going to arrive so they could expect me. I came in, and filled out info on a computer as other reviews have stated, but it was relatively painless. Luckily, I still have the insurance and service plan on my phone, so was not out of pocket anything, and the repair was complete in less than 40 minutes. Greg even followed up to check to make sure everything was still working the next day. BTW, since it is close to downtown, I was afraid parking would be an issue, but there is plenty of parking and the store is well maintained.]
