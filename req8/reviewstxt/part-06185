[116241489397196684566,100486935873505866313,Stay away from this dealership; if you have a problem they are rude, un-kind and can care less. We bought a brand new car and took it to this dealship due to a electrical problem and was treated like crap. Yes a brand new car and already three problems with it; thats why we bought new not to have the problems!! Also to top it off we made a appointment and took off from work and was the first one there to be told "oh" we over booked you can come back another day. Focus on your customer service as you lack this in a major way. Las Vegas use one of the other TWO dealerships in Las Vegas.]
