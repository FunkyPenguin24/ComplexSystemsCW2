[116422230101619841520,101152408545577937573,My son attends HPU and enjoys it very much. I believe that this university instills character building from the moment a student walks on campus. The classes are challenging but not impossible because of the teachers commitment to their students. When I went to college I knew the president of the school because the library had a picture hanging of him never met him once. The president at HPU is involved daily with all who attend. His deep concern for every student goes beyond anything I have ever experienced. Quality leadership, education, and morality makes HPU the best. We feel blessed to have our son attend.]
