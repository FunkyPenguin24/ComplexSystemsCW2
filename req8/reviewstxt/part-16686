Also, they sanction live, local music on a weekly basis. Mama Carmen's is one of my favorite venues, and I recommend it to anyone who asks just for the atmosphere alone. As for the food and coffee? The beverages are highly above average, but the food is rather expensive in comparison. I usually just get coffee for that very reason. There is a shoppe located on a platform within the cafe, and while I initially thought that this aspect of Mama C's was out of sorts considering it's a coffee shop and not a retail store, I was surprised and moved by the unique items on display. For Mama Carmen's it just works, I suppose. If you're looking for a good place to kick back for a couple hours, or the right atmosphere for that first coffee date, then look no further.]
