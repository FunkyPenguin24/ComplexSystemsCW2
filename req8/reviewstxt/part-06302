[102217584348668662623,100492277250946075663,I've been dealing with Barrett for three years and two cars. The sales staff and service staff have always been the epitome of courtesy and professionalism. The service writer goes out off her way to see that I'm satisfied. My next car, if it is a Jag, will be bought at Barrett.]
