[100477422572952134870,101054182474185806411,Lori and Mark are beyond experts and have styled rockstars (I have learned recently). They are very friendly and inviting, fantastic conversation if you want it. They listen everytime to your thoughts about your hair and style down to the letter! My hair is weird/difficult to cut but this salon's capable stylists pull through everytime. They've been in the East Village for years and have great stories about the old art scene. I highly recommend Salon Seven.]
