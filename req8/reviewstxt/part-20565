[105794202623216829535,100089231447489059801,My experience at the Apple store was amazing! I was there for the launch of the Iphone 5 and they're so many people there. It was madness but the employees there kept it professional and they took care of me even when I was having problems with Sprint. They also explained to me all the details of the iphone 5 and the customer service was amazing!!!! Such a beautiful store design and its defiantly one of my favorite stores in NYC.]
