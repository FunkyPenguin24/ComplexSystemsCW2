[109106314264765264077,100961075385239036072,As a professional organizer, I'm not a fan of off site storage. It's difficult to transport items there, I find people forget about what's stored, and you pay for space you don't use. With CityStash Storage (which I actually use), I love the online portal, showing you what you stored, and that you pay for only the space you use! And living in a city, where having a car is a minority, the helpful crew of CityStash does all the work. They came to my home, provided storage bins, came back to pick up my stash (on time, too!) and took it to their storage location. It's there when I need it and the delivery cost is very affordable. I recommend them all the time!]
