[104100182347550411948,100100804680321624170,Wow, we had dived the Swan in Busselton and had pretty low expectations about the Lena, but Kim really opened our eyes up to the amazing ecosystem developing on the Lena. Two dives at the price they offered was by far the best value diving experience we have had yet! I can recommend to anyone seeking a dive tour run by divers for divers!]
