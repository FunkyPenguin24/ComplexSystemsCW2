[100255720423656581962,101105282949173294797,Awesome excursion off the Napali coast in Kauai. I would highly recommend this boat tour. Our captain was Anthony and Ryan was his copilot. We cruised up the coast skimming across the waves on a relatively calm day. We saw a pod of dolphins and stopped to take pictures and videos. The dolphins followed us for about 15 minutes. So cool! We drove the boat in and out of caves all along the coast. We stopped and slowed the boat every time we found wildlife. We also stopped on a private ancient Hawaiian beach and had lunch, snorkeled, and walked around and explored the the old Hawaiian village. Ryan provided us with the historical information as we hiked. Super fun and exciting! Well worth every penny. It cost about $150 a person food, beverage, and tshirt included.]
