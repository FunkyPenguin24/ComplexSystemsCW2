[104718222318564585343,100889771635912691412,I scheduled a physical 2 months in advance because of my travel schedule. I filled out and printed my forms online to save time, showed up early... only to be told the Doctor is running over 1 hour behind. I asked if I could leave and come back in 1 hour (knowing it'd be 90 minutes before I'd be seen by anyone) and receptionist said they can't do that. I need to stay in waiting room or they will cross my name out. Typical "Dr.'s Time is more important that yours" attitude. Clientele is at the lower end of economic scale. Reception room smelled like stale cigarettes. Not exactly the best environment. I left without being seen.]
