[100099906907791083286,100005910362123033245,We have lived in the SW valley for 13 years, and have been looking for a good, fair mechanic for about as long. My search has ended. Phil is personable, knowledgeable, and runs a business like it should be run. A clean shop tells me a lot. I had brake issues, every time I stepped on the brakes it was "brake and shake". I knew it was unsafe and did not want my teenagers driving it. Phil and his team got the job done on time and on budget. I love working with a "Mom and Pop" business.]
