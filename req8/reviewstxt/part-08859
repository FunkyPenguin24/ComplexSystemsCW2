[113135732946021589419,100630519370903825363,A great stay down to the finest detail. Clean, well appointed rooms, many fine courtesies both in the room and in the establishment at large. Beds were very comfortable, nice ambiance (fireplace and furnishings), and a great view from the window. Scrumptious breakfasts, afternoon tea time (actually wine tasting ;) And the staff was fantastic; friendly, attentive, and personable. Location was nice. Easy walk to shops and restaurants. If you're staying in Langley, this is the place to stay.]
