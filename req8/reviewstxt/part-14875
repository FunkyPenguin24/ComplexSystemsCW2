[104564567976791630482,100960810857279435943,Hands down the WORST buffet we have ever experienced!!! Cold, greasy, stale and reheated. All meat dishes so tough we couldn't chew them! Beef and Brocolli had rancid beef in it and I was suffering from severe gastrointestinal distress within 10 minutes of leaving the restaurant. When we expressed our lack of satisfaction in the meal, our server looked around, said "My manager not here" and that was the end of it. We will be telling everyone we know to avoid this cesspool like the plague!!!!!]
