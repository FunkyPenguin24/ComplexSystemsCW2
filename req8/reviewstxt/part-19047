[104132969029021008371,100008448958504449488,Lost two customers after terrible service. Stopped by with a friend to show her the burritos I had been talking about. After waiting 45 minutes we were brought the wrong food and our server apologized for messing up the order. He brought out 3 samples of soup in tiny sauce containers to somehow make up for the error. There was no apology and they stilled tried to charge us full price after making us wait.]
