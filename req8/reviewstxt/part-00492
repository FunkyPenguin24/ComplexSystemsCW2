[100125303495469904621,100184722026437468756,I was not impressed with Oskar Blues. Though the atmosphere is fun and casual, there really isn't much else I can compliment them on. The menu selection and prices were only adequate. They don't pay attention to detail or remember specific requests in food prep and we waited for what seemed like forever to get our food. The staff seem to be there for a paycheck, not you; you don't feel valued as a customer. The equivalent restaurant/bar and rival brewery in Longmont, the Pumphouse, is FAR superior in both food, beer, service and quality.]
