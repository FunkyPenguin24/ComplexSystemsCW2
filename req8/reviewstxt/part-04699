We chose Doraku from the previous recommendations and we weren't disappointed. Sushi is his favorite food and this rocked his world! After open heart, we choose only the best foods for him. The staff was amazing. Kanoe was awesome and provided him two awesome desserts: Tempura brownie and a hot, sweet banana with ice cream and chocolate drizzle. The emperor, volcano and Doraku rolls as well as the sho toru and uni were as fresh and savory as anything imaginable! Thank you Doraku for everything!]
