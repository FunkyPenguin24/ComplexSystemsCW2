[113621380660303968551,100400139079312644470,If you are looking for service, prompt return of phone calls, or friendly people, do not buy a car from this dealership. Go to Dallas. Their prices are more competitive, and the people at the Dallas dealership actually treat you like they value your business. It is an unfortunate representation of the MINI brand because I love the car. We have had problem after problem with the service department here. They lie, they do not fulfill promises, and they hold your car hostage. For example, they lied and told me my car could be fixed within 24 hours because they had the part in stock. Two days later, they told me the part had to be ordered from another state. They also told me they were keeping my freshly detailed car inside their warehouse, but when the insurance adjuster arrived to take photos, the car had snow all over it and had clearly been outside for several days. It's unfortunate. I hope that MINI finds another dealer in the area.]
