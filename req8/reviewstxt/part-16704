[106558933717625594987,101058932468958382443,Mike Gasca was awesome. He was very knowledgeable, helpful, and helped me save a lot of money. I was told that I needed a new alternator from o'reillys according to their test and I called the dealership. Mike insisted over the phone that it sounded like it was just the battery and that I should bring it in. I did and he quickly got the guys on it and low and behold just the battery. He got it taken care of much quicker than expected. Mike Gasca did an excellent job and deserves recognition. I will recommend people to this dealership in the future because of my experience. -The above review was posted as a service and with the authorization of Toyota of Irving, and the comments and opinions expressed in the review are those of a customer from Toyota of Irving.]
