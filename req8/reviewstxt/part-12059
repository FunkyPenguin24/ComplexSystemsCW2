[104952429076186299722,100804705985798577511,Taco Amigo is the bomb! I've been going there since high school and it is consistantly great! Everything is good there, I love the tostadas and bean burritos. Even the American food they have is yummy, the fries and cheeseburger are good, no better fry sauce anywhere. Go check it out if you haven't been!]
