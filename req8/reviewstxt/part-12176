[101935962277847587834,100810430640393393188,The quality of service we received from Glass Act was beyond our initial expectation. We received same day service at our place of residence and the job was completed in less than 45 minutes. The work is guaranteed and their prices are extremely competitive, which was great news for someone who just had their car broken into and their wallet stolen. Very professional, exceptionally prompt, and highly recommended without hesitation!]
