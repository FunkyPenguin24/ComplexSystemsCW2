[101985015881941594474,100394109201813497263,Seems real nice. Greens were in nice shape as were bunker sand considering it is a Par 33. Figure on a dogleg par 4 that is 285 to the green over water and big trees. Stayed at Holiday Inn next to it and for $9 (senior over 55) + cart for $7, looks to be a nice quick 4 iron and PW get out and get around.]
