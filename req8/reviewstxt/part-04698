[109021975759735311202,100408931202099410427,I love it here! The seats are a little bit worn out and have some miles on them. They do a good job of keep the bathroom descent. The movie sometime will flicker maybe once or twice, and I wish the sound was more surround....but again 2 bucks. $2 for a movie...can't beat it. I use to do the $8 theaters...not anymore! No more "I PAID $8 FOR THAT" mistake.]
