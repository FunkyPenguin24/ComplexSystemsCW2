The food is AWESOME!! My biggest complaint with most Indian restaurants is they're so stingy with the meat. So many Indian restaurants, if you order a chicken dish for example, it will show up with maybe just 5-6 small bites of chicken on it. But Touch of Spice totally fills your plate with chicken. And their sauces are delicious. I love it! I used to think the prices were a little high - over $10 for most entr√©es. But when you consider how much more actual food you get than from the typical Indian restaurant it's well worth it. Definitely one of the absolute best Indian restaurants in the entire New York City area.]
