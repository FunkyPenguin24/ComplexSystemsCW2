[105431932988503877372,100239875080878661519,I took my car in to Autobarn Mazda of Evanston recently with some torn wiper blades that needed replacing. Gigi Giuliano helped me in service. I was greeted and helped quickly. I'd say I was in and out in 15 minutes with a brand new set of blades installed. Price was competitive and service was great.]
