[118265716522148692211,100859948570373479175,TERRIBLE. Made reservations for a Corvette, for my birthday. When we arrived, the attendant told us they did not have the Corvette in and instead had a Camaro for us to use. We explained that this was my birthday, and that we specifically wanted the Corvette. The manager came out and spoke to us, and simply could not tell us why it was not there. She offered us the Camaro. She never offered us a discount. Clearly Hertz does not care about customer service. If they did she would have offered us a car for free or significantly discounted. TERRIBLE Customer Service!]
