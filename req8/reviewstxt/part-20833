[100317020890321797944,100103824325743235308,Food was very good. I had a six ounce sirloin and broccoli. The order was taken promptly. The food arrived reasonably soon with plenty of chips, salsa and beer in the meantime. Service was attentive without anyone hovering. It was very good. The decor is nothing special, just standard Chili's but it was fine.]
