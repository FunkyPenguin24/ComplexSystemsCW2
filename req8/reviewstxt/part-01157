[100391884558344107811,100219329871828262984,I've had totally fine experiences here in the past. The worst thing is that the screens are not that big and the seating is far from away, making you feel disconnected from the movie. Also, the experience I had last night: Some friends and I went to see the midnight Prometheus premier. Set to start at 12:01am, previews started a couple minutes late and took until about 12:30. The player broke at the end of the previews. Everyone eventually moved into a theatre that had a showing starting at 12:40. We watched the previews again and the same thing happened there too and in the original theatre's second attempt. Needless to say, we never ended up seeing the movie. We did get a refund and a voucher for another movie which was good, but it never seemed like there was a chance things would get worked out once they went awry. For a big summer premier and being a large movie theatre at a prime location in New York, this is pretty disappointing. The process to get the refund and voucher was aweful because everybody used the cell phone ticket, which two staff people were dealing with by writing down confirmation numbers by hand - it was a terrible process and I'm just grateful that I was near the very front of the line. The people at the end could have been there for 30-60min for all I know.]
