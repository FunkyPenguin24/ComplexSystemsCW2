[103292944685581427224,100089813111787038598,I agree with the one star review before me. Our family went to this church for about 5 months as well. I really did like the services. They offer good classes/groups. I really wanted to to get to know the people there, but I too, didn't feel completely accepted and welcomed there. I walked up to some of the members at different times to try to have a conversation, but for some reason they perceived it differently. I am the nicest person you could ever meet. Usually I am nicer to people than they are to me. Unfortunately no one wanted to talk to me and get to know me there. I felt awkward, out of place and that made me upset, so we left. Maybe it's me, but I didn't feel like I fit in at all at Discovery. At times they would put pressure on tithing. Discovery Church isn't for everyone. It definitely wasn't the church for us. You may enjoy Discovery, and feel at home here. Anyway, the church is okay, It's not bad, although in my opinion I feel they need to make some changes and improvements.]
