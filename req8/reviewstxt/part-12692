[106529268318996022239,100839897483768768505,My husband made our reservations and I was initially concerned when I read some of the older reviews. Whatever the problems were in the past, THEY FIXED IT. The rooms are tasteful, and exceedingly clean, the staff is very friendly and helpful. Darling and Earl on the front desk deserve commendation for going above and beyond. Yes, it is still near a busy road, and yes the bathrooms are small (it is an older building), but if you want convenience, this is the spot. Easy off the interstate, close to the Metro, close to Old Town. A great value for the money.]
