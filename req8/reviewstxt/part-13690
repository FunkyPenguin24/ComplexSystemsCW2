[104088604327064699530,100895407645472774272,We just held my daughter's wedding at the Palace. The hall was beautiful, facilities were fine and food was very very good. The service was a bit iffy though from the time of booking. Support before the event was lacking and serving staff on the day were cranky. But all in all, the wedding was a huge success and we'll have good memories of the day.]
