[103872640264176626837,100733514400602283903,I had really bad experiences from childhood with visits to the Dentist. My roommate reccommended Dr. Smithson and so I went to see her. It had been several years since I had gone because of my fear. I was welcomed when I first arrived and made comfortable. Teresa, the hygenist, made me feel very at ease and she explained everything she was going to do before doing it and made my visit more bareable. That was over 5 years ago and now I don't mind going for my regular visits at all !!!!!!! The staff is the best, very friendly, courteous and always making you feel at ease. Going to the Dentist isn't the most desirable thing to do, but now with the experiences with Dr. Smithson's office I can go without any dread. Keep up the great work!!!]
