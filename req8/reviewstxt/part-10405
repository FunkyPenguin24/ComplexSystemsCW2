[110819085005174109458,100715368636281330300,I've used RR Landscaping for several years--reluctantly at first because I've always done my own lawn work. Their service is excellent, staff is professional and courteous. They are reliable, efficient and do their best to accommodate requests. They charge a fair price, which is very important. I have never had a reason to regret hiring them -- and there have been times I've thought about it just because I'm stingy. But what takes me 3 hours, they do in 30 minutes (1.5 acres), and time is money. The owner is easily accessible and responsive to questions. I have also found them to be pro-active when/if there are conflicts (weather related, etc), which is great because I know the job will get done. I guess anyone can have a bad experience with a company -- but having been a client for several years, with no prior knowledge of this company, I have to say it's been a great relationship. And now I found out they do Christmas lights. Holy cow, I may get off the hook this year!]
