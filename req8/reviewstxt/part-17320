[115172152403993185818,101092797198588877261,I've been back to Hot Wingz numerous times, and plan to keep this as one of my go-tos. The wings are tasty, and for portion size, you purchase by the pound, so if you get a small portion, it's because you bought a small portion! Lol! I happen to enjoy the fried pickles, and the sweet potato tots, as well as their wings! It's a great place to have a group of people because it's a quickie joint, and the staff is very attentive. All in all, if you go in expecting a four star restaurant, yeah, you're gonna be disappointed. If your yen is for wings done really well, then check this place out for yourself.]
