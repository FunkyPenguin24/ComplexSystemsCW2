[105748871513675498797,100429753745254301730,Ordered online. Waited almost an hour for our food. There was quite a line but they we're only helping one person at a time. Got home with cold food and a messed up order. Thankfully the manager stepped up and refunded our order. But after reading all the poor reviews, it makes me wonder if corporate doesn't care about this store.]
