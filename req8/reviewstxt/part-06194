[100392634730812036507,100487262963008115926,We just moved to the Greenbelt area and have already tried a few other repair shops. We've been trying to fix our repair engine light so we can pass the emissions test. We've received varying opinions about the repair and large estimates. I decided to go to Meineke because they specialize in exhaust systems and we had a couple coupons. My experience with these chain places has varied greatly depending on the management, but overall, I am very pleased with this particular experience. Making an appointment is a little weird. You either have to make one on the internet or walk in -- you can't really call and make an appointment. Once I was there, though, the service was great and the building was clean. Waiting was not an unpleasant experience. They quoted me the lowest price yet for my catalytic converter and finished the repair in just over an hour. I'll definitely be back.]
