[110708812894497497816,100418313732722342947,The salesman David was great, that was until I meant with the sales manager who I will not mention, I believe. He has no people skills and is everything that fake is. When the deal was not done he basically told his salesman this, " That's fine we've spent too much time on this, move on we have another day and another customer to get, hurry up and get back to work David". I have heard that the service was horrible but now I know for sure this will be the last place I shop or refer........Would not reccomend this dealership]
