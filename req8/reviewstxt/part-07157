[108065683276798348132,100540954788319367706,The service was horrible, after waiting for our food over 30 minutes the food finally came and it wasn't all it was priced to be. Once we were done eating the waiter didn't care to acknowledge our table until 15 minutes later when he noticed we were getting up to pay in the front. We were so upset we took the check and paid the rude lady in the front, which was in a hurry and made it seem like everyone was disturbing her. Horrible service. I would not recommend this place to anyone, stay away! Horrible SERVICE, and too over priced for NOTHING!]
