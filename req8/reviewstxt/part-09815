[103486222535737733260,100682255846509576345,Short review: this place is great as a short get-away and for small hikes. If you have 30 minutes to kill, come her and walk about a bit. I've been coming here since I was a child. 20 years later, it's still magical to me. I come here now for basic exercise and to get my daily dose of nature. The nature center is an "unimproved" conservation site, meaning it's essentially left to the elements with regular trail clearing and maintenance and non-native species removal. You're not going to see something as exciting as a Bobcat here, but there are plenty of wood peckers, owls, wrens, and hawks throughout the area. The plant life is fun too. There are something like 8 trails, the longest of which takes about 20 minutes to hike. If you're looking for a low-lying and easy trail, stick to the stream and main road, it will take all of 15 minutes. If you're looking for views, check out Roadrunner Ridge, Bluebird Trail, and Wren Way, if you take all three they'll take about 40 minutes total to walk. Don't forget to bring a bag to pick up trash along the way. There isn't much at all, the maintenance at this park is really up to par, but it's always a good idea to pick up a little as well.]
