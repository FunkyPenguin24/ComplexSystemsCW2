[102823175292498374728,100359920877517024636,Me, my wife and two kids ate here three weeks ago. The portions were very small, food was ok ( not great ), but their billing is ridiculous. The waitress charged my credit card twice by accident. They gave me a slip saying the one charge was voided, but it was not. I went in the next day ( Sunday ) to get it corrected and they guaranteed me they would call the bank Monday morning to reissue the funds. A week later I called them since it was not corrected, and the manager apologized and guaranteed me he would issue a credit right away. No credit was issued so I let a week pass and I call again. Same manager picked up and apologized, he said he would get back to me later in the day.....he did not. The very next day I get a call from Chase card services, all sorts of fraudulent charges just popped up on my account. I live in the Bahamas and rarely use this card. This meal was one of a few times I used the card in the last year. This establishment is improper with billing at the very least. I encourage you to go elsewhere.]
