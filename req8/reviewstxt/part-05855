But they've got a small selection of fruits and vegetables as well. In addition, they've got a decent selection of Asian food products given the small size of the store. But the standout is the food - specifically the Vietnamese hoagies. Where they're chicken of tofu, these are hands down one of the tastiest and unique hoagies around.
