[104251295636192964424,100096163056283126686,I have had many family members' cars repaired by this location of Dykstra's Auto numerous times, and each time has been just as great as the last. The staff is courteous and helpful beyond expectations. Their prices are fair and they really go the extra mile to make sure you're satisfied. The work has been great as well, and they seem to be very thorough. It's also worth noting that many of my co-workers frequently have their vehicles repaired by the same location and have nothing but great things to say as well.]
