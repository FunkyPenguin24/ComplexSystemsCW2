[109336793728221676674,101092281577636037973,Dr. Michelle and Dr. RJ have cured my back and arm pain! I have been going to chiropractors since I was 18 (for 12 years) and for the first time in 12 years I do not have back and arm pain. Also, I have had chronic migraines since 1st grade and lived on ibuprofen and migraine medicine for years. My migraines have now completely stopped! But they have done more than cure my back and arm pain and migraines. They have showed me a better way to live and how to be healthy and how to raise healthy children. I now have more energy (without drinking caffeine all day) and hardly ever get sick! I can't imagine living any other way. Thank you Dr. Michelle, Dr. RJ, Jenn and Keri for making my family apart of your family!]
