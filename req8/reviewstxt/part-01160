[106627463057349832839,100219546998794547696,I chose Luli's Bridal for my bridesmaid dresses because they carried a designer that I really liked. Shopping for the dresses was fine, until fittings came around. One of my bridesmaids came down for 2 fittings, and on the 2nd they still needed a slight alteration to the hem. Because she lives in NY, we were told that the other bridesmaid could pick up the dress when she came for her fitting in 2 weeks. When the other bridesmaid went to the fitting, she not only had problems with her dress being WAY too large, but also the 1st bridesmaid's dress was not not ready to be picked up as we had been assured it would be. I called asking for them to ship it because myself and the 2 bridesmaids are all about an hour away and have things going on -- and they said that I would need to pay for it myself for a miscommunication on their part!]
