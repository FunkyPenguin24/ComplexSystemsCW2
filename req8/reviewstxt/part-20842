[115144591951276639050,100104433269143620093,I have never had a HORRIBLE experience with a car dealership like Miller Infinty in Sherman Oaks. We leased a brand new Infinty form them in May 2012. The first problem started that month we started having engine problems and we will losing so much oil, oil leaked all over my driveway. I took them 2 weeks to fix the problem and they said that they would pay for the repairs on the driveway and they never did. Since then I have taken the car numerous amounts of times for repairs. The last straw was when we took our car for an oil change and for them to fix our DVD/CD player (yet another problem) They couldn't fix the DVD/CD player they had to order a new one. It's 2 months later and numerous amounts of phone calls and messages to both the auto repair shop and the manager and still the problem is not fixed. We have 3 small children so you can imagine how fun it is to be in a car with them and the DVD player doesn't work. I DO NOT RECOMMEND EVER GETTING A CAR FROM INFINTY ESPECIALLY MILLER INFINTY. The worst car and customer service we have ever experienced!!!!!]
