[107787285066625778748,100332847496330282963,In 2011 my doctor sent blood work to Bethesda hospital, they contacted my mother to get insurance information and when she didn't have it they just ignored it. Two years later I get calls from debt collectors saying I owe money to the hospital, had they called me in the first place it would have been resolved instantly. Now two years later they can't update the insurance information so I have to pay out of pocket. Avoid this hospital at all costs.]
