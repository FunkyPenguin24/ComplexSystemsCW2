[117196745482147904525,100326249423173335778,I came to Paula looking for a special Valentine's gift for my husband. She took boudoir photos that took my (and definitely my husband's!) breath away! Paula's boudoir work isn't what she's known for, but let me tell you, ladies, she knows what she's doing. She knew how to pose me in ways that flattered my curvy body, and she made me feel SOOO comfortable that I forgot I was prancing around a near stranger with barely any clothes on! Another thing to consider is that Captured Memories offers spectacular print products at very reasonable prices-- and they look GREAT! Working with Kristen, the very talented designer behind Captured Memories, was a joy. She gave me EXACTLY what I wanted in the layout of the boudoir album I gave to my husband. Captured Memories isn't aiming to be "trendy" in their photo style; they go for classic. If this is what you're looking for, look no further. Two thumbs up! :)]
