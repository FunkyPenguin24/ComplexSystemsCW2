Food was over bland. Good drinks though
Showing wear and tear
The food is ok. I don't order from here my family does. I eat the food. The cost matches the price.
The food here was not bad. It was basically the only place on the main strip my boyfriend and I could afford to eat at. I have to say though the best part of our experience was listening to one of the locals who came in, Tim the Fisherman. He was hilarious and had us laughing the whole dinner!
We have used them for 2 years and have been happy for the most part. They sometimes forget to do my side walks and don't do the best around the mail box, but they are reliable for the most part. We did sign a two year contract of which they forgot about us the second year and I had to call after two snow falls (of which I had to hand shovel) and remind them of the contract. They of course corrected the error and delivered good service. I am not sure about renewing this upcoming season because they want a advanced payment for a total season prior to a single snow fall. They are putting all the risk on to their customers as from what I could gather they don't refund if snow fall is less, but have a extra $10 charge per 1 inch over 60 inches. Giving them 2 years of payment ahead of time is a great deal of money, so we'll likely research other places first.
Now a J.J. North's Country Buffet - still some rebranding pains here and there, but loads better than EZ Buffet on 32nd St & Greenway Road..!
Our daughter spilled her lemonade and the puddle sat on the floor with a towel over it for 20 minutes. The server forgot the ketchup, salad dressing, refill for spilled drink, salad and a pleasant attitude. The manager was kind enough to take care of the issues when brought to his attention.
Mostly soccer fields. Nice BMX track. Shallowford road entrance is convenient...but often locked for no apparent reason. Flat good place to run/walk.
I have a few complaints about this store. #1 This store has been open long enough to know what sells and when. If you go into the store to buy something and there is absolutely nothing on the shelves time after time, someone isn't doing their job. As an example, the pet food section. It isn't unusual to find nothing at all on the shelves, especially on traditional high sales days like the first of the month and Fridays. Certainly they KNOW these are very high sales days. Someone in charge of ordering isn't doing their job. The same goes for all the other departments as well. #2 Garden Department. Our growing season is different than other parts of the country, but the company responsible for stocking plants and trees does a poor job. We have a much longer growing season than many parts of the country, but vegetable plants are brought in at the very beginning of the season, and that's it. With many weeks left for planting, there is nothing to buy. The selection is pitifully small too. There are more vegetables that will grow here besides peppers, tomatoes, zucchini and eggplant. Fruit trees should be planted during the colder months, NOT during the summer, but that's when you can find the largest selection. Poor ordering once again. #3 Employees While the employees are friendly enough, there are far too few of them. Long lines at the checkout and the service desk are really a pain in the neck. Most of the cashiers are pretty good and do the best they can, but there are a few who chat with the customers non stop, and that slows down the whole line. They seem oblivious to the frustration expressed by the people waiting in line. In addition to problems at the check-out and service desk, it's sometimes very hard to find someone to help. They may be really busy trying to get stuff on the shelves and aren't pleased to be stopped in the middle. For instance, the dairy cases. If I want something, but the space for that product is empty, but I can actually see cases stacked in the back, through the glass, I naturally want someone to get it for me. Just NOT enough employees to keep the store stocked. The store is clean, the prices are fairly reasonable, but the people of not only Pahrump, but all the smaller, surrounding communities DEPEND on THIS Walmart for so many things. If Walmart doesn't have it, it might mean a trip to Las Vegas and a trip of 150 miles or more to find what we need. When Walmart came to our community, a lot of smaller businesses closed. That's really too bad, but new businesses are opening. That means that Walmart isn't our only choice any more. So listen up Walmart. If you plan to serve this community that you've moved into, you need to do a much better job, for US.

Nice little place for relaxation!
I received a Groupon gift certificate to Complexions for a massage, facial, and manicure. It took a while to get an appointment but finally set one up. The massage was nice; the massage therapist did try to upsell me but I expected it because I had already read the Google reviews. Next I had the facial. This was my first professional facial and was definitely my favorite part of the day. I was so relaxed, I didn't want to move when he was finished. Finally, I had the manicure. I wanted to upgrade to Shellac but when I pointed to it and asked Bianca, she said they don't do Shellac (why would you have them displayed then?) And, I agree with a previous reviewer that my manicure started chipping after 2 days, if not before (and all of my nails ended up breaking). I still have another gift certificate to use for the same 3 treatments, but I know what to expect, and all and all was really happy with my services and the people that performed them.
Helt ok, en bastu och det hade blivit topp poäng.....
Could have made better. Prices are a bit high compared to the quantity they provide. Hygenic place.
The food was okay but the chicken nuggets were terrible. The waitress took my cup to refill it along with several other cups and when she gave me my cup back, it wasn't my cup. It was white and mine was red. But...I stuck a straw in it and drank it all up. The meal was 12.75. Kinda high I think for the food but most of it tasted fine
As of right now I am sitting on the toilet wondering why I had even thought of going to this so called "fancy" restaurant. I spent $16 on eight pieces of ravioli. I did the math. $2 a bite. @8 bites. Get real! Do not come here. Unless you have money to waste and like small servings and poor service... Oh and sitting on the toilet

Hunterian Museum consists of two stories packed with jars that contain various organs and specimens from all kinds of species. There are lots of human organs floating in jars. There is also aplacewhere you can see how surgeries have been showedall through the ages. Really amazing and interesting place to go.
Great school my daughter loves going there It is very nice n clean good respectable teachers. Would recommend anyone to bring there child.I like knowing what my daughter is learning and i recieve daily reports everyday .
The service is terrible! They now have a policy that if you order for delivery you have to purchase over $20. I'll stick to local restaurants food is just as good if not better and they'll deliver an order that is in the $13-$18 range. What makes it worse is that this policy applies to people who live less than 5 minutes away from the Spring Valley location.
not that much good
Good service. Good meals.
chillin here...
you don't have anywhere to go, have 50 bucks in your pocket it's the place for you budy 30 bucks for least ticket balcony available and a well known place. So it's for us
CONS: SLOW service, soggy quiche, no eggs till 8. PROS: Nice decor. Our first trip a few months ago was disappointing, but we decided to give it another try today. Last time we came around 10 am and it was a zoo, so when our basic food took 45-60 minutes we let it go. Today we arrived about 7:25 am and there were only a few tables occupied. We ordered and paid, about about 5 minutes later were apologized to, and told that they forgot to tell us but they "don't do eggs until 8 am"? Really? Too much trouble for the cook to get in before then? They open at 6:30 mind you. Not wanting to wait 30 minutes, we changed our order to a quiche and a bagel sandwich along with a bagel for our toddler. We asked for a rush on the toddler's bagel if possible. About 25 minutes later (after the reorder) we got all of our food. Quiche was barely warm and bottom crust was near non existent and soggy. Another annoyance is the use of the iPad swipe app where they flip the iPad over back to you and you can select a tip - starting at 15% and going up from there. This is at the counter mind you, not table service. Oh, sure, you deserve $4.50 to take my order at the counter. Sorry, no. We really want this place to work as it's adorable, and much of the food looks great. We were excited that they are one of the few places in town that open early (toddler remember), but since the grill doesn't come on till 8 who cares? We'll not soon be back. Maybe the third time is the charm?
Its an ok bar !

Found a reasonable price for oil change and tire rotation ($44) using Honda's website, and booked a service appointment. When I arrived, the gentlemen explained that these services would be $56. I explained that I had booked a lower rate online, and he countered by noting "he had been there for five years and these had always been the prices." He also explained that the Honda website didn't connect with their service website, requiring me to re-enter all of my data. Thankfully, I brought a work laptop with me, and was able to show him the exact price quote and reservation (the reservation apparently had gone through by means unknown when the rest of my data did not). Only after showing him this quote did they change the price, which seemed pretty fishy. The quality of the repairs, turnaround time, and facilities were fine, but this left a sour taste in my mouth. Integrity matters to me as much or more than anything else when it comes to dealerships. Caveat emptor.
I've been shopping the Hampton store since opening and have always had the same problem , not enough sales staff to help and answer questions. Find the selection to be great on most all lines I purchace.
I had the sesami chicken and crab rangoon. Main Moon used to be such a good place for take out. Something has changed. The food quality has fallen off greatly. They used to have nice meaty pieces of chicken in their sesami chicken. Now it is mostly thick pieces of fried dough with a tiny piece of chicken in them. The crab rangoon used to have noticeable pieces of crab meat that you could also taste. Not anymore. Now it is 99.9% creamcheese and .1% crab. I guess decided to cut corners to make money. Well I'm looking for a new Chinese take out place.

The rate was cheap and the room was clean. If you want something more you shouldn't be staying at Motel 6. The water in the shower cycled from hot to cold, and the towel was akin to sandpaper.
Stuffy atmosphere. Food is good, but nothing exceptional. Overcharged my card $30. Pay with cash or watch your credit card statement.
If you like a fresh, tasty, thin crust pizza, this is the place. A little pricey but worth it.
I don't know if it was the fact that it was Sunday football or that they're regularly just very busy. Our service was slow and the food took a lifetime. I will say though that the staff were extremely friendly and once our issues were brought up to them our experience took a drastic turn for the better. The burgers were okay not too special, but the nachos were splendid.
We ordered and picked up take out, 1) Women spoke to fast on phone and I was sure the order would not be correct. 2) Expensive for small portions 3) Make sure to order lemon, tartar sauce, and malt vinegar as you will not receive if you don't ask.4) Coleslaw was very dry with no flavor. The two piece dinner was more like a piece and a half the second piece was the size of a shrimp.
The proprietors should spend some money fixing up the building and the property in general - it has been dirty and run down for many years. Fuel prices are often beat by many other local stations - diesel and propane used to be the best deal in town, now the complete opposite.
I've never eaten at the upstairs restaurant, but I've sampled some fare that was brought downstairs to the bar, at which I am becoming a regular. Okay, so the cocktails are lousy, but the atmosphere is cool. It's just a typical dive bar, but the Sunday night karaoke show is a blast! The DJ is funny and personable. There's plenty of bar room games, lots of pool tables, and a great local crowd. The bartenders are not the friendliest I've seen, but they are quick with the drinks. I love Fat Daddy's Bar, and I recommend it.
Hotel is good, although not as nice as The Chattanoogan. Staff is friendly, but the wifi is terribly slow, no excuse when you are in a city with some of the fastest Internet speeds in the nation. The wifi signal is also very poor. For comparison the wifi speeds at the Chattanoogan are in excess of 20mbps to the 1 mbps I get in my room.

My repair was for a Galaxy S4 with a cracked screen. All other functions on the phone were normal. Staff were courteous and friendly. The repair took longer than expected, and I believe was more troublesome than expected. I ended up with some discoloration at the top and bottom of my screen. The replacement glass sits a little taller on the phone than the original glass. The replacement glass was difficult to clean. I worked on it as long as I could, and then just put another screen protector over it. They discounted my repair due to the discoloration, and gave me an unlimited warranty for it. The phone works well after the repair, so overall I'm willing to live with it until my next upgrade cycle. I appreciate the discount and the additional warranty.
I don't know about any other dough or style, but the handmade pan pizza is ready to go! Thoroughly impressed with it!

The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice. We were even treated to a surprise performance by a well known jazz musician. The service in the restaurant is awful. We had a reservation for 1:30pm. We were seated promptly within five minutes of arrival. Our salads arrived within 15 minutes of ordering, however the entree did not arrive until much later. We were not served our entree until 2:35pm. The waiter refreshed our soft drinks and water several times, however he did not offer an explanation as to why the food was taking so long to come out of the kitchen. The waiter also double charged our credit cards. He attempted to explain that he had to wait for his manager to revise the charges which in turn took another 30 minutes. If you decide to visit the restaurant, I would suggest that you have exorbitant amount of time for dinner or just have drinks.
It's a typical US post office. I've had bad service and I've had swift service. It really depends on the day. Overall I give it a 5 / 10 because they are just like every other post office around. When it's busy, it takes forever, but that is to be expected. When it's not busy, I get in and out of there in less then 5 minutes. Sometimes the service workers can be chatty, which is nice when they are chatting to you, but annoying when you are waiting in line.

Ordered tacos, burrito and some other dishes around the table. All the food was good and plenty of it for the price. I ordered a burrito as it's $3, and I couldn't believe a burrito could only be $3. It was decent size and tasty, however it's just a meat burrito, no rice, beans any of that jazz. The service was very nice, it took a while to get the food, but nothing too long. The place is inside what seems to be a home that was made into a restaurant. It's not dirty but it's not what you would call clean. Some of the ceiling tiles are water stained, the tables are a dingy green. Nothing sticky on the tables or visible dirt anywhere in the place, but doesn't give the feeling of clean. They offer lunch specials for $7 which are good size and price. At the end of the meal you get sopapillas for the table and your honey sauce. Very tasty and there was no charge for them so that's a big plus! I would visit again as the food was good, staff VERY friendly, and the sopapilla are free and great! Been to a few Mexican restaurants and none offer sopapilla for just eating there.
The motel was clean, quite, and the staff was very acommodating.
Two problems, one there was no separate check in for Etihad airline's business class flying to Islamabad, so waited in an awfully long queue. Second the staff at Customer information center did not know how to satisfy and inform people about connecting flights.

Nice staff and clean rooms. I only wish they offered more than dounts for breakfast.
there is no insulation between rooms. There was a wedding party in the hotel and I was part of all the detailes while being in my room. The bend and everything was right below my window. And how can you sleep on a wedding night? I had to leave the hotel at 7:30 for a meeting on Saturday. On the evening before I have asked how is the breakfast served. I was told that on weekends it only starts at 8 (if)., but I will be taken care off. In the morning nobody knew anything about it. At the end I was offered a donut from a wending machine.

Eh, it was alright. Food tasted good but looked rather un-inspiring. Staff was the worst part. I was only person at the bar, do you think any of the 5 staff members hanging out at the end of the bar bothered to try to engage in conversation? Nope, not once.
I just rented the storage unit last night and when I returned with the truck to unload the truck, the gate code did not work. We had to leave. I called the office this morning and she checked the records and went outside and tried my code and it indeed did not work. She found it hadn't downloaded to the gate system. She was very cordial and helpful. I would suggest, however, that you check the code while they are still in the office to make sure it doesn't happen to you.

The food is ok but it varies of who is doing the cooking, ie., they skimp on the veggies in their soups or meat doesn't look appealing. Sometimes, they "forget" to give your rice or salad on entrees for carry out. When the right people are doing their, food is really great!

I ordered artichoke ravioli with white and red sauce. The white sauce was thick goop tht tasted like it came out of a can. The red sauce was less yucky but still tasted canned. I asked the waitress and she said that corporate insisted that they used premade sauces. Even if it is made by corporate or wherever, it is still canned and had no flavor. They lost me as a customer. I won't pay money to eat at a restaurant that uses premade food.

Verplante Bedienung und Essen war geschmacklich okay...
I work across the street from here and have to say; the food is pretty good. The chips are fresh fried, and sometimes, you even get about 1/4" of the frier oil in the bottom of the basket. The salsa leaves a lot to be desired, though edible (tastes like tomato sauce with a few spices). That being said, I'll probably be back. Probably.

Ok, so the shop has some cool gifts... but lets talk about the dogs and the staff. The three employees there house their 3 dogs behind the counter. My kids are afraid of dogs and when the older of their 3 dogs cornered one barking at her the employees were less than apologetic. Saying (with my kid in tears mind you) "Oh sweetie he's not going to hurt you." and laughing it off. There was a smell of dog urine in the store where one of the dogs had peed in the corner and it wasn't wiped up until I alerted the staff. When they were alerted of it they proceeded to slap the 16 week puppy and rub his nose in it. I understand this is Austin and it's hip to have a shop dog. But the staff was rude, unprofessional and showed a complete lack of understanding of customer issues. I will be shopping elsewhere purely on the performance of their staff.
I had eaten at Sugar 'n Spice before, but had only gotten the burger as I normally do when I am uncertain of the quality of the food. Today I was looking for something different. So, I asked my wife who was born and raised in Spartanburg where we should go. Sugar n' Spice was the choice. The outside looks like a 50's drive-in, they still have the drive up area, but it does not appear to be utilized anymore. The inside is a little dated and they could use some new covers on there chairs. But the decor really goes with the feel of the place. I ordered the souvlaki which came with a side of fried, coleslaw and a slice of toast. The souvlaki smelled great and I had high hopes, but after taking my first bite I was totally overwhelmed by the amount of seasoning. I would love to try the same flavor with about 80% less seasoning and cooked medium as opposed to well done. But, I am not sure if a souvlaki is supposed to be this way or not. The coleslaw was ok and the fries were good but not great. You can get onion rings and fries, but I have to avoid the onions. I am not saying avoid this place, but be careful ordering the souvlaki unless you love A LOT of seasoning. Think I will get the burger again the next time the wife wants Sugar n' Spice.
This place used to be so much more pleasant. Prices have always been on the high side, but worth it because of the experience, UNTIL NOW. Seems like shady teens like to go there. The ones that are too old to be happy at the movies, but not old enough to drink. As a result it constantly feels as though a fight is about to break out. I honestly like the place, I just dislike the rowdy teens.

Particularmente, recomiendo el menu del futbol, si vas a ver un partido, puedes pedir una hamburguesa interminable con tu refresco o cerveza, el precio no es desorbitado, dada la calidad de la carne, por unos 9 euros sales del lugar habiendo visto un buen partido y bien comido.

I had Room 217 which has exposure to Interstate traffic noise, but that noise faded behind the closed door and closed drapes--like white noise which let me sleep well. The heater worked well. The bedding was firm and clean--no bugs. This is a basic hotel room, but it does have a coffee maker, microwave, fridge and TV--nothing fancy, all requirements met. Bathroom was clean, with bottles of shampoo, lotion and bars of soap. Lighting is more than adequate. I felt safe in my room and between my room and the office. Don't know anything about the sound insulation between rooms, as my neighbors were quiet. The continental breakfast was no less that what we had at the Acme motel last year. Good pancake machine--one button--clean, no sloppy batter outside, no fuss. Not the palace but neither are the room rates. I'd stay there again.

Me and two girlfriends ate here yesterday evening by accident. We planned to go to Raku, but I guess it's closed...? Oops. But anyways, It was around 6:00 pm so there wasn't a crowd. The atmosphere is inviting and the decor is modern and vibrant. The server was friendly and fairly knowledgeable. We had the Firenze Pizza (mushroom and sausage), the Brooklyn Pizza (chicken, broccoli, Gorgonzola) and the Carpaccio. The pizza wasn't the best I've had but I guess it wasn't the worst. I couldn't really taste the Gorgonzola and that's a pungent cheese. It tasted a little overdone on the bottom although it was flimsy. We each ordered the mango Bellini-those were yummy! In conclusion, I probably wouldn't get pizza again because I don't think it's worth the $14. Maybe I'll come back for a drink and happy hour one day though.
I like to write these reviews as soon as I leave a place - so here goes. Took the a while to get our drinks ( water and a diet coke) then we had to ASK the server for bread after being there for about 20 min. Appetizers were ok. We ordered a sushi roll and some shrimp that was tossed in spicy mayo. We ordered the Porterhouse for 2 as our entree, which is where the disappointment really came in. The thing look like an over grilled London broil, had no seasoning and was over-cooked from our specification of medium- rare. Burnt on the outside, and chewy texture to the meat. Then they slice it before they serve it, but they didn't let it rest enough and all the juice ran out - dry dry dry! We live in the neighborhood, and would give them another chance, but not on a $70 steak!

Some of the seasoned staff (both management and people working there for as long as I have been going there) at Vit City can be downright rude, don't even bother to look you in the eye when you are speaking to them and, alas, in need of serious grooming. I find that the newer staff have a concept about customer service and are able to actually address me as if I am a real, live talking person (not to mention, a customer). If it weren't for the fact that their organic produce is cheaper than whole foods and they have some items I can't get at Trader Joe's, I would not bother with this store. As it is, I get a lot of my health staples online and only use this store as a testing ground for something I want to try before ordering online. Amazon has a lot of the vitamins and staples that they sell and since it quite a drive to Vit City, I figure the tradeoff betw shipping fees and gas are pretty much the same now days. I do wish the management made an effort to have better customer service...then I might find it enjoyable enough to take the drive over to that part of town and actually look forward to shopping at Vit City.

They definitely have a good visual presence of a quality auto sales company, very nice looking vehicles if you don't look to close. We explained that we knew exactly what we were looking for as far as the interior design of a vehicle. As we started looking around the lot the salesperson was not overbearing but did recommend different vehicles that may fit our specific use. After test driving our vehicle, was to short of a true drive to get a true feel of the vehicle. We rushed through the process and purchased the vehicle to only later learn that the bearings on the passengers drive axle is going out and that there were several other small items that we found. The biggest disappointment was in the detailing of the vehicle, and routine maintenance that should have been done prior to selling any vehicle. Once we got the vehicle home I started REALLY looking over the vehicle and found that the clean engine was due to a poor degreasing job and a pressure washer, the engine oil has at least 2,000 to 2,500 miles on it. The interior detailing was a joke when I pulled the seat our of the van I found that the tracks were clogged with an unknown sticky substance, this was the same with all the seat channels. the rear power ports didn't work and all it took was to change a 30 amp fuse. The wiper motor delay control board was improperly removed to make changes to the contacts to make it work, which does when it feels like, then it was zip tied back into place. The drivers side headlight has a cracked seal and there is fogging inside of the headlamp while the passenger side is crystal clear. I removed the collapsible center console and found over $1.00 in change two different type of card with personal information and a lot of evidence that a lot of sticky liquid had been spilled on this console and never cleaned properly. 10 minuets and a 12mm socket had the console out and the cleaning process begins. An hour later and the console and all seat brackets were removed and cleaned. There is a smaller family owned used car sales lot in my home town that goes that extra mile to ensure that if nothing else the cars are cleaned like near. Everything that can come out of the interior does and is thoroughly cleaned and scrubbed, they go even as far and using fabric paint to even out faded material cars. So if you do decide to buy from Seaport look everything over REAL close for cleanliness and quality repairs. Also, if the vehicle has been modified in any way, lifted/lowered, anything other that stock do not buy the extended warranty. I have never found a company that will cover any repair to a any vehicle that is not in stock condition.

Would not have know about this place unless it was for google. Located right down on the waters edge. Lots and lots of stairs to get to this place so if you can’t use them get a boat in. The food was good. Had the fish and chips. The serving was huge. The dressing on the salad was not so nice.The staff are friendly and helpful.
visited many times, situated in Kangra Valley with snow peaks on the north side. Nice place. Young students studying medicine.
We called ahead and asked specifically if they had a set up with queso and salsa and they said yes! We get there and we are a table of 4 and they bring one deal of salsa. We asked for more salsa and queso ans she brings one more salsa and one queso. We then asked for another deal of queso and we were informed it would cost an additional 1.99! As a table of 4 and us having 2 separate checks it would of been more considerate to give us 2 deals of queso before changing us for the second bowl. Besides that the food was very good.

No fridge to keep my water & drinks cool!
This place is the WORST when it comes to getting your order correct through the drive through. There has not been a single time that I have purchase food from this place that they did not mess it up one way or another. If you order a salad, they will give you the wrong one; if they give you the right one, it means they did not give you a dressing. Order a "sour cream" and chive baked potato? Well then expect to only get only the baked potato without any sour cream. If you check your order and something is missing, better start honking your horn because as soon as you touch the bag of food they are passing to you, the window is slammed closed and the employee runs away. So you have to wait there honking until they decide to return. How hard is it to put stuff in a bag?!

Great food, but I could do without the Pizza Nazi experience. I've never eaten anywhere that had more tension in the serving line. Give me the NY pizza without the NY attitude.
I have no idea why Mr. Gordon would say it's like Ruby Tuesday's or Chile's. It's a fast-food chicken joint with a slightly more upscale atmosphere. Think Popeye's with the decor of McCallister's Deli. The food was pretty good, though. And the onion rings were excellent.
It’s a diner ! (And that’s a good thing) Riki’s Family Restaurant offered a typical local diner experience – extremely fast service, typical diner food with a mix of some homemade specialties (homemade soups, authentic turkey), a great local clientele base, and just like many established diners; a no frills environment with some outdated décor. These are all good things if you enjoy local diners -- and we’ll be back ! But, if you are not a fan of local diners then you may want to try another place.

Not bad - typical Chinese buffet. It's entirely self serve so you save money on tips.
I got bad service. Plus they over charged my credit card more than the price I signed for..go at you're own risk

long, funny 18th hole, and a road running thru the course. watch out for cars.
The bear inn is a very nice looking pub from the inside out. The beer garden is lovely in summer and it's one of the nicer places in Street to grab a drink. However, the food is poor. I have eaten here many times and I don't think I have ever been happy.The food is bland, uninspiring and the quality makes me question if they actually have a chef or someone just microwaving the food. The quality of the food at the bear Inn is frustrating because if they lifted their game it would be a fine establishment. Venture to Wells instead if you are seeking a good pub/restaurant.
Awesome food. Service and wait staff not so much. Pretty girls, but all smoke and mirrors.
If you like crowds and inconvenience then you'll love this place. I could list several reasons for only rating three stars, but I will give just one. After having a beer and a couple glasses of wine while I waited over an hour for a table, I decided to switch to coffee after being seated at one of the restaurants. However, they don't serve coffee. The server explained that I would have to go to the coffee bar downstairs. He explained this is how it is in Italy. You don't go to the same place for dinner, dessert, coffee, etc. I get it, but given the lines and crowd and the wait, it was really annoying to have to leave my friends to go downstairs to buy a coffee. I drank more wine instead.

Stopped here after dinner on a Saturday night to have a beer at the bar and pick up some new bottles to take home. The thing about this beer shop that is different from others I've been to (Tasty, Beer Study, Bottle Revolution, etc) is that the bar area is much larger - it is the size of bar you'd see in a restaurant. That means that there is less room for racks of bottled beer for sale. The selection of bottled beer was nicely organized and had some great option for creating a sample pack, like I was doing. They had a local section with a good amount of local breweries. The place was packed to the brim with bottles - even a little room in the back. There weren't as many beers on tap as I had expected for a bar that size. We had the Duck Rabbit Hoppy Bunny since we hadn't tried it before. I think they had about 7 beers on tap and I wish they had had a few more. They also served wine. I might have ordered a second beer but they were $7 a piece! The bet part of this beer shop is the lounge area - couches and tables for people to sit. At 8pm on a Saturday night we were able to get a seat easily. We will definitely be back.

The picture used is wrong.
I got my haircut from a lady named Olesya. She did a good job with the cut itself (aside from cutting my hair a bit too short in one area that has a pretty wicked cowlick). She was very attentive to detail, and spend a good amount of time straightening, tapering, and in general making sure it looked as good as it could. For this 20 minute cut, I was charged $19 (plus tip, of course). I thought that was a bit pricey, since I have gotten comparable cuts in the same area for $13. The extra $6 probably won't break the bank for anyone, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference between the service I received in the two establishments. So, while I have no specific beefs with my experiences at Gio's, I think there are better options out there.

Great drinks and food. Happy Hour is a must! Only 3 stars due to a rude red-headed hostess that kept making faces when we asked for something. She also treated us differently compared to the other parties.
Food a bit pricy, drinks are great tough great place to hang out and enjoy the time. Service a little slow but very friendly!
The pools are clean and good food. The bathrooms need a bit of cleaning an proper lights
Breakers is an excellent place to get dinner. The food is excellent and the price is modest, but watch out for customer service. Sometimes it takes ages to get your food, and once my mother's salad had a ladybug on it. Perfect, though, for a kid's birthday or a relaxing surf-style dinner
Meh. It's Pizza Hut. It's clean inside and the pizza is the same as every other Hut.

I almost want to select Poor - Fair because I really expected high quality considering the Windsor Star vote done online made this restaurant the most popular one. I will probably not order from there again. I picked up my order, and when I arrived I had to wait 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me there. Mind you the place seemed pretty dead, so maybe the staff was in the back... either way I don't care. 10 minutes of MY time wasted. The food was OK. I ordered 2 pizzas 1 large, and 1 small. The large pizza was lightly burned; not too bad but enough for me to notice. The toppings were good, and I actually think they used real garlic, but they used canned mushrooms (which I despise). I don't know the quality of the rest of the ingredients, but that alone makes me not want to order from them again. The other small pizza was plain: cheese and pepperoni, and the kids said that it was "the best pizza in the world". Mind you they are 3&4 years old. Anyways... highly disappointed with a pizza that nearly 1400 people (or 23% of the votes) said that it was 'best pizza in town'. I usually order from Koolini or Francos, as their pizza usually does not disappoint me, and I usually stick to what I know, but I wanted something different that night. Overall.. not the worst pizza I had in my life, but nowhere near "the best".

When I first came here I thought Hair heaven. There is hair everywhere. That what i love about this place. The price of their hair is reasonable. Their other products are high. I always seem to be spending over 100 dollars everytime i go and im like for what. These are some real prices Morning Glory Product (hairspray) 10.99,lets jam (hair gel) 7.99, cantu (leave in conditioner) 5.99. The cantu i saw in walmart a week after i purchased it walmart is cheaper so is the jam. And it is ghetto fab in there. The music the person with a fully pierced face and getto girls looking tired and mad. But they will glady take your money.
Decent ambiance, decent crowd.. 2nd best in Vasco!

**** Update... they refunded the money of that worthless Landry's card. Admit it, people only go here because the movie was awesome... and it's pretty hard to mess up crab legs. Plus who doesn't want to quote Forrest Gump while eating dinner? Anyway, my experience with Bubba Gumps in Chas was fine.... except for the inept waitress who got us to sign up for a Landry's Select Club card.... Allegedly, this card would act like any store card where you get points for spending money and then you get free stuff. She said the card was $25, but as soon as you signed up online, you got the money right back, so it would be a free card. WRONG. You sign up and then see that you don't get your money back... all you've done is spend $25 toward your next meal at Bubba Gumps. Who would do that? Why would anyone pay forward a meal? I mean, Haley Joel Osment might, but even that idiot died at the end of that sappy crap fest "Pay it Forward." So I called Landry's to get this taken off the bill. They had me call the general manager to get a refund. The general manager acted as if I had asked him to sire my first born. Then he said he would call me back after he talked to Landry's. Well, that was like 20 minutes ago and I have yet to hear from him. We'll see how this goes. I knew I should have just gotten frozen crab legs from Publix and made them at home. It would have been a hell of a lot cheaper than what I spent at Bubba Gumps. But, as Forrest said so long ago, 'stupid is as stupid does.'

Parks were fun, but pretty crowded. Bring your own food for meals though. Fed a family of four at lunch one day...$38 for two pops, a couple chicken strip baskets with fries and two mini corn dog baskets with fries. Food was not good and portions were small. In short...parks fun, food spendy and not good. Some of the park staff were quite rude as well but the rest were very nice.
Very family oriented, love the river behind the place, very relaxing.....
Took them a week longer than they said it would.
July 7, 2013~We've been here several times & go for the fajitas mainly. Today ... they were horrible! Ordered 1 chicken & 1 Beef...completely overcooked! Both dried out, onions burnt on the dinner plate cuz it was super, super hot plate! AWFUL! More like jerky...no juices/no moisture and lots of unchewable parts to the beef. I think they changed their meat supplier??? IF YOU DO GO...MAKE SURE TO order your Fajitas Medium RARE or something cuz they'll keep cooking on your metal plate! Was really disappointed :o( Service was fine tho & well, the decor? Oh well, it is what it is. We'll try again someday, but will specifically order food MED. RARE.

Quick fast inspection but horrible customer service
True North is a warm, friendly, laid-back place that offers a variety of house-made baked goods, sandwiches, and espresso drinks. I was on the hunt for a latte, anything that wasn't Dunkin' Donuts. A true quest in the North Shore. I ordered a medium-sized whole milk latte and had the nice option of having it in a paper cup or to enjoy it in a mug and sit and stay a while. The medium was enormous. The espresso was over extracted but had promising notes. The milk was over heated making the drink too warm and allowing the usual carmelizing effect of the milk to be lost. Not a hint of latte art to be had. However, the cafe is using a professional espresso machine and what appears to be high-quality beans. Given the proper instructions and practice, the coffee jock could turn into a true barista and those beans would reveal their true flavors. While there, we sampled some house made muffins, lemon poppy seed and cranberry, both were fresh and moist. The cafe has a true local feel with a steady stream of people coming in and sitting and staying to catch up with friends. In an area of the country known for rough and rush (I know I grew up there) this was a nice change of pace. I'll stop in on my next visit to Burlington but perhaps opt for some tea and a fresh scone and continue my latte quest in a different cafe.

I give one star and thats only because it is in a great location to travel the city from because its right next to the Earls Court Tube Station. However, I would never stay here again. The room was tiny and incredibly hot. The only clock in the room was the remote control for the broken air conditioner and the clock was wrong!!! We had no international phone so we asked for a wake up call on our last night and they forgot to call us so we almost missed our cruise. Terrible service and clueless front desk....

HORRIBLE. H-o-r-r-i-b-l-e. I live about 5 miles from this location, so it's convenient. I JUST got back from their drive-thru and they gave me the completely different order! I will say the manager apologized (sincerely) and said my order would be credited the next time through. Only thing I have to say to her response is: Gas these days is expensive. Not only did I have to pay for my food--but I also had to pay for my gas. And I'll spend more gas driving there for my actual order. What a waste.

Its Buffalo Wild Wings, that should sum up the decor and food, but every else about this place is a mixture of trashy, ridiculous, and poor. To save time, I will just run through the highlights reel. If you ask for mustard, you get packets... What restaurant, wait, sports bar serves mustard by the packet and not the bottle? The service... I watched waitresses hide from management under counters, I listened to them complain about how they could be at home doing laundry, and I watched them serve food that you could tell was just slapped in a tray with no regard to serving size or amount of sauce. Last, there is something tacky about walking into an all american establishment like B-Dubs and seeing a "buffalo wild wings does not allow firearms in this establishment.". The sign conjure up memories of Aurora Colorado and how if anyone had a "firearm" the incident could have been corrected a whole lot sooner. I will look forward to choking down the rest of my dinner while listening to this baby mama drama that the waitress is trying to "s'plain" to her manager!
This location is no longer in buisiness.
Ever since this place opened, my wife and I have been hardcore prophets bringing many out of town friends and family in there. "Great rolls, chicken fried chicken, vegetables, and waffles" etc.... They had an excellent selection of vegetables and you were able to choose the 3, out of 10 or so, of them. Our favorites included whole glazed carrots, green beans, and some great mac & cheese. However, they now just give you some pretty mediocre mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. They changed their menu on 12-12-08, took away the great salad and bread appetizers and made some other big changes that really knocked this place down from an excellent five star home cooking place down to a pretty mediocre establishment. The venerable "chicken friend chicken and waffles" is no longer a menu item, although they did allow me to still order that. There are now many better places in the area, but maybe they will get some sense and go back to the old way of doing things.
Nobody come check on you and they ate out my plate. Had to leave

I cannot get anyone on the phone here to check out availability (their phone number is mysteriously showing on South Commons site. Buddy! The purpose of the phone is so you do NOT have to WASTE TIME driving to Walmarts that do not have product in stock! Your "defense" of this Walmart is as bad as their service is. However, I do realize that they are still setting up shop at this new store, and are most likely even more understaffed than the others right now.

Specialist tea and coffee. Small, a little cramped and perhaps exclusive. A plethora of Apple Macbooks.
Not authentic Mexican food but it was good. The sauces were a bit bland foe my taste, and not as hot as I was expecting. Prices could be a little a tad bit lower.

I order a shrimp plate with vegetable melody. I should have asked or been told what is in the Melody, part was Eggplant . I am allergic to Eggplant and did start to have an reaction, I took a pile to stop the reaction. I never eat the eggplant but just in contact with the other foods I started to get sick. It should be on the menu what is on each plate. The fire alarm went off and we were told not to leave it Happened before and FD turn off.
No wifi if you have apple devices, service sucked
I got a smoothie (Sailor's Papaya) that was OK but it tasted way too flavourless; it probably had a lot of healthy stuff in it, to the detriment of any tastiness. The enviro was chilled, with nice music and people sitting at the bar. The service was way too slow, but there was also a lot of people behind the bar doing nothing. Each drink took 5-10 mins to make. If all the tables were full, they'd have no chance, and the people sitting at the bar would be crowded with people trying to order. There's plenty of other fast, efficient, healthy juice bars around. It shouldn't be hard to do the same plus some alcohol.

I never write reviews but felt obligated to warn people of how slow this place is. The kids like the arcade which is probably the only reason we would ever go again. The service is the absolute slowest we have ever experienced. The first few times we gave them the benefit of doubt. But after several times here, it is agonizing how slow and inefficient they are. Not sure management has any restaurant experience and I feel bad for the staff that have to hear the complaints. PUBLIC NOTICE: do not go here if you plan for a quick exit or even a reasonable exit. Plan on staying for 2+ hours for diner food.

We are college students, and for our budget this hotel was perfect. It's about a 5 minute drive from Sea World/Discovery Cove/Aquatica. About a 15-20 minute drive from Walt Disney World. Lots of restaurants nearby and it is right off of I-4 which was convenient for getting to Disney World. Room: very modern looking. Clean lines, very open and roomy. The floors of the room were odd to me as there was no carpet- just a "hardwood" laminate floor. This was fine by me until I walked barefoot for a few minutes and looked at the bottom of my feet...BLACK! Luckily, I always bring slippers when I stay in hotels so I just wore those while I was in the room. There is a also a rather large desk in the room which served as a nice station for uploading pictures and videos after each day. And one MAJOR COMPLAINT i had was that there were almost NO outlets!!! Only one by the desk, one by the A/C unit, and 1 in the bathroom. This was annoying because we had 2 phones, 2 cameras, a video camera, and a laptop to charge every night. We did not see any bugs. Bathroom: Tons of counter space! Plus, the entire underside of the sink/counter has a shelf so you can store things there (and the shelf is raised so your things aren't sitting on the nasty floor). The shower/toilet room was really tiny but it was fine enough for us. My only complaint about the tub was that the bottom was really rough so it was not very comfortable to stand on it after walking around the parks all day. Maybe bring shower shoes? Beds: very comfortable! Except they do not provide any comforters- only sheets and the fleece blanket that most hotels have. We never felt cold at night, but it would have been nice to have a soft fluffy comforter to relax on in between activities. Storage: TONS of extra room for suitcases, bags, coolers, etc. Dresser had 3 drawers, (1 shallow and 2 deep drawers). Closet was large, but I was the only one who used it so I'm not sure if 2 or more people could share it. Facility: The pool area looked really really nice. We did not go down to the pool to swim because it was too cold, but it looked like a nice relaxing place. The pool is a "walk-in" which is cool because I rarely see those. There is also sand around the pool area where the lounge chairs are which I guess gives you a "Beach" effect. The elevators almost never worked, which was a pain because we were on the 4th floor. In sum, we really did enjoy our stay at Avanti. If you've got a limited budget and you're not really that picky then this place would be perfect for you.

Me and my dad were going to buy a bunny from this pet retailer. This isn't the best store in town. It was neat so it didn't look or smell like a dirty farm. When we picked out my bunny it was fine but when the worker suggested the cage, I was terrified. The cage she pick out for my medium sized bunny was an extra-large Super Pet® cage. They had the 2 floor cages, but she didn't even look at those. Then we bought her supplies. When we bought the hut for them to sleep in she suggested the Ecotrition® 8-in-1 hut, which I happily bought. And we also bought beding, food, hay, and everything else a bunny needs. Except toys, treats, and things to chew on because she said the Ecotrition® hut will "Take care of it all at a small price." When we bought everything at the cashier's desk it was a total of a whopping $250 even though we only bought 10 things!!! When we got home, I set everything up nice and pretty and watched my new pet in her new palace. The next day, me and my dad looked at my bunny struggling to fit into her hut. The worker said "It will fit her just fine" but it didn't even fit her head! We decided we will but another one in a couple days. The day after that, I was lifting the hut by pieces of cardboard, thinking it was a good idea. It was but my bunny kept eating the cvardboard. But never knd that, when I was setting it up on the cardboard, I was 6 or 7 COCKROACHES!!!!! Then there was a 2 big ones inside her food! I will never shop here again.

it's advertised as a Internet cafe but they don't even have a full internet service, you can get a free coupon if you buy a drink, wich only allows you to use 2 hour online or 300MB ? Well, they should offer internet by the hour at unlimeted rate like other places aout there, real internet cafes!

As a regular movie go-er, I like this Cinema because you can park very close for free as the cinema covers the cost of a 3 hour slot. Furthermore, there are plenty of screens and generally a good choice except at term time when the kids are off school. I particularly like the Imex Large Hi-Def screen and sound and the 3D is something else. As normal with cinemas, drinks and snacks are over priced. In very cold weather some of the screens can be a bit chilly.

My server was good until near the end, then, the facade wore off, and I felt rushed and as if the whole first part was all phony. As for the vibe of the place on the whole. " Boys from Brazil. The bus boys laughed in my face as I was led past them and one of them stuck his fingers down his throat as I was led past them, hitlers chitlens ? Definitely a sophomoric staff on the whole that let its prejudices show, you better be a senior citizen or one of the beautiful yet plastic barbie doll types when you walk in. The food is delicious although unbelievably over the top on the salt, the chips are poor and salsas so/so, and over the top on the cheese, if the food was tasty the salt hid it, come to think of it the place sucks ! Better business bureau and anti defamation league take note. P.S. the type of place that Fight Club remarks about in that they pee in the soup and blow buggers in yer food, good thing I accept that as the norm when I go out to eat and totally accept that fact.
We came here for my wife's birthday because we heard they make great cocktails. The cocktails did not disappoint, but the service was mediocre at best. We had to wait nearly 30 min for a table, IN SPITE OF HAVING A RESERVATION, and there was an unusually long wait between bringing our drink and taking a food order, even though we all got appetizers. Clearly they are trying to maximize profits by squeezing reservations close together and overworking the wait staff. All of this wouldn't have bothered me too much except that they automatically added a 20% gratuity to our bill. I reserve 20% for a truly great restaurant experience, which this was not, and bristled a bit at not having a choice in the matter. I understand the need for automatic gratuities for large groups, but there were only 7 of us, so this seemed excessive. Oh yeah, and if you don't like seafood, the menu is a bit limited.
My husband and I went on a random friday and were seated in the lounge which was packed and has a few tvs. My husband got steak and said it was ok. I got a pasta dish which was good but not worth the price imo. The service was quick and accurate but bottom line the prices are too high.

The cheesesteak sandwiches here were fair to good. Nothing special. I did not care for the bread. The sandwich with provolone barely had any cheese on it. Definitely not enough to call it a "cheese"steak. The sandwich with Cheese Whiz had the distinct flavor of a can. My iced tea was either stale or tasted like Chandler water. Chocolate chip cookie looked yummy, but was a no go, as well. The service was good enough. There wasn't really anything here that would make me want to return.

My husband and I went to Orange Hill Restaurant for our wedding anniversary this July 4th 2013. They took us right in even though our reservation wasn't for another half hour. We had a beautiful view of the city to watch the fireworks and were pleased with the seating. The waitress was very nice but we couldn't help overhearing at the next table that the diners had to pay for bread while they waited for dinner. They sent it back because they didn't want to pay 8 dollars for flatbread. My husband asked the waitress about the bread and she said they have some they offer but they charge for the special breads now. I ordered a 55 lobster dinner with a 8 dinner salad. We noticed that the table settings were very sparse. If you ordered a salad you had to keep the same fork for dinner. I know this is a common practice but not usually at a more pricey restaurant. After waiting for 45 minutes for dinner we complained that we wanted our food and the waitress said there were a lot of tickets before ours. The people who ordered after us got their food and it was a table of 4. The manager came over and bought us drinks so that helped. The whole point of this review is a couple of things, the lobster dinner I received was one of the biggest rip offs I've ever had. It was a 6 oz tail on a plate with a square of potatoes and 3 mind you 3 pieces of asparagus. And the other thing is the whole place seemed like it was a restaurant going out of business. Cut backs on the bread and silverware and skimpy embarrassing food. My husband saw them turn away people that did not have reservations but 3 tables sat empty the whole time we were there. We've been eating at this place for our anniversary for 4 or 5 years and they owe me a do over.

Waited an hour to get someone to take the phone. Was told they'll call in 3 hours. Left the store and 5 hours later no call. Went back to the store and waited another hour just to meet the super tech Guillermo. Mr. Guillermo said the phone runs HOT b/c of many apps installed on the phone EVEN THOUGH if the phone is OFF. Hmm... Sprint sure hired some brilliant techs. Mr. Guillermo almost lost his temper b/c I was trying to educate him. Stomped away and slammed the door. Very Professional. A+ for fail.

I got delivery. Food was so overpriced and the quality was very low. I won't order from here ever again.
Although, overall good. I didn't think it was very professional to serve a chocolate coffee mouse looking like a piece of human excrement....! People have come here to eat not to be put off by lack of presentation. The fact that the manager wanted it presented this way lacks imagination and poor management. And really it's not putting the customer first.

I read a few of the reviews on here and decided to give Rofini's pizza a shot. Being somewhat of a pizza connoisseur, I wasn't overly impressed. The pepperoni was good; but the crust, cheese, and sauce were nothing to write home about.
Bof... Pour un homme on se sent un peu seul dans ce salon mais personnel agréable.
Is there a website? Is there anyway to send an e-card or e-mail to a resident?
unfortunately we couldn't taste the food; I suspect, could have been good,as we were asked to rush with our menu order by some "waiter-boy"?. Initial-entry treatment by the staff was not any better, so my wife called it adios, and we ended up some blocks away in El Sombrero. We sure lost on a food; well, may be next time staff be more digestible so we will be able it digest the food. asta manianna ( sorry no speak Spanish).

Fez. The food was good had meatballs they came warm but not hot no choice on eggs it appears fried only . The coffee was good 5 senses brand. Fez is only really let down by how slow the service is. If you don't enjoy the meal order something else , if the service is slow what then?

The people are nice. The prices are fair. The food is perfectly average. It's not spectacular, or great, or even good. It's literally average. A slight nudge up for the service and prices, but the food is what is the lasting memory. A memory colored in beige.

Most of the staff was very friendly and helpful. They are willing to do whatever it takes to make the customer happy. I will recommend their services to others.
I agree with the rest that this place is by far the dirtiest place I have been to. The people are friendly and the play area is nice but they don't have trash cans available or an area to put used plates. They said they would pick it up, but they don't it baffles me.

We saw a show there recently in what were billed (and charged) as good seats. We were so far away the faces of the performers were indistinguishable. Generally the sound quality was good for the music, but not for the dialogue. They get good shows there that I would like to see, but in the future will be very picky about seating.

Very nice decor ... nice place to spend time with frnds ...
I have been to Starbucks in DC, NYC, Chicago, Singapore, Tokyo, London, and Australia, to name a few, and this location I can confidently say is the "worst Starbucks I have been to in the entire world." The service is slow, the staff is rude, they frequently are more entertained by their side conversations then their job, and the drinks are more often than not made incorrectly. For the past year I have observed such poor service that Starbucks corporate should fire the entire team and replace them. The single good thing about this place is the number of free drinks I get because they mange to get my simple order incorrect every other time I go.

The pumps have gas. Staff is friendly. Is it me or is gas really expensive?
My experience was decent. To be honest I found this place to be very expensive and non personal. I was disappointed that I waited over 2 hours two different times to meet with the doctor and only saw her under 10 minutes. I was hoping to get more of a detailed plan and review of my health conditions for the amount of money that I paid. I think you can find another doctor that is more reasonable and personal in the Atlanta area.

This place has a few pro's and con's like many others around town. Pro's = They are generally quick to help and polite once you show up and get into their garage. They usually have a good selection of tires available on hand and do not need to wait to order them. The waiting area is decently comfortable and have good quality coffee. Con's = Don't bother calling as they don't generally answer and if they do it feels like they don't want to bother talking to you. The "parking lot" is incredibly small and only have one way to enter and exit... on a busy day good luck trying to get in or out of this place. bottom line... visit them on a slow point in the day as far as traffic goes and you can be helped quickly otherwise pick someplace else.

This village is situated around the National Highway no 2 popularly called Grant Trunk Road. This village is reach in farming of sugarcane. All around of this village are small hills and chain of hills can be seen from distance.
I have been to several other Andy's and this particular one is tired and run down. The food is okay but they have shrunk the portions and the staff don't exactly act like they even want to be there. Shame it used to be a favorite spot of mine.
On a fair weather day we head here. Excellent pub grub (fancy pancy cuisine it is not!) and you can sit in the enclosed garden with your kids and dogs. Nice couple of hours....every time

The PANDORA Store BEWARE -- of this store and its legit appearance!!! NOT a Authentic/ Original Pandora Store, it is PRIVATELY owned (3rd Party Authorized retailer/ Franchise - as describe by Pandora Corporate Office) SCAMMER of their 30 day return Policy.. My husband purchased $300 worth of charms as a Surprise gift for me (which I already had purchased at JARED) When he tried to return the items a few days later (because I already had the same charms) he was dismissed and told that the items had already been used. I later returned to Politely explained and showed the Store manager that I already had then charms. Store Manager (Jossie Nunez) was abrupt and rude would not even hear me out. She lacks Customer Service Skills, conducts herself VERY unprofessional, and uses slurs in Spanish about the customer. BUT Thank God for American Express!!! They were able to dispute our charges. This store just LOST a Pandora Obsessed customer. Please buy at JARED, No return Hassles!
Ok very basic hotel. Recently renovated with flat screen TVs and linens, but otherwise unremarkable. The gym in the basement is deplorable and the free breakfast is standard for La Quinta, essentially a wide assortment of carbs. Its a fairly tall building, 16 or so stories and does give great views of the city if your room faces it. Great if you happen to be there on 4th of July. Its a safe clean bed, not much better.

I've been a member for over a year now. Comments about the bathrooms are pretty accurate. Since I primarily swim don't know as much about the equipment. I'd say pool and suit spinner are poorly managed. Often they let kids play in the pool when people are trying to swim laps and they have no swimsuit water extractor. I usually use the facility located in Pearland instead of this one.
It's hard to sell the hamburger as healthy, but they make a valiant and sort of self righteous effort. The Food? It's Ok, I guess. About the same quality as 5 Guys but I like 5 Guys better, at least they know what they are selling! I thought the bun could be fresher and of higher quality. I didn't feel cheated, but I didn't feel healthier or over satisfied either!

My girlfriend and I decided to go for the first time and I would say she was more disappointed than I was, simply because too many penny slots and not enough other increment slots. I agree with her. It is a nice, clean place and very interesting atmosphere though. So...if you enjoy the penny slots then this is your place to go! I still prefer Horseshoe Casino in Cleveland. :)

I've had totally fine experiences here in the past. The worst thing is that the screens are not that big and the seating is far from away, making you feel disconnected from the movie. Also, the experience I had last night: Some friends and I went to see the midnight Prometheus premier. Set to start at 12:01am, previews started a couple minutes late and took until about 12:30. The player broke at the end of the previews. Everyone eventually moved into a theatre that had a showing starting at 12:40. We watched the previews again and the same thing happened there too and in the original theatre's second attempt. Needless to say, we never ended up seeing the movie. We did get a refund and a voucher for another movie which was good, but it never seemed like there was a chance things would get worked out once they went awry. For a big summer premier and being a large movie theatre at a prime location in New York, this is pretty disappointing. The process to get the refund and voucher was aweful because everybody used the cell phone ticket, which two staff people were dealing with by writing down confirmation numbers by hand - it was a terrible process and I'm just grateful that I was near the very front of the line. The people at the end could have been there for 30-60min for all I know.
I chose Luli's Bridal for my bridesmaid dresses because they carried a designer that I really liked. Shopping for the dresses was fine, until fittings came around. One of my bridesmaids came down for 2 fittings, and on the 2nd they still needed a slight alteration to the hem. Because she lives in NY, we were told that the other bridesmaid could pick up the dress when she came for her fitting in 2 weeks. When the other bridesmaid went to the fitting, she not only had problems with her dress being WAY too large, but also the 1st bridesmaid's dress was not not ready to be picked up as we had been assured it would be. I called asking for them to ship it because myself and the 2 bridesmaids are all about an hour away and have things going on -- and they said that I would need to pay for it myself for a miscommunication on their part!

My driver delivered my pizza and gave me the wrong change back. I caught him befor he left and he still gave the wrong change back so I'm wondering who else he's done this too. Cause he sure was counting his money when I walked up to his car. Was he on drugs or was it just a mental slip up no matter what it was. In this day and age you can't mis-handle people's money.
I stayed for a night there during Sep '13. It was a rainy afternoon and I was stuck there. The hotel room was clean and good. But the problem was with their outdated (they call it "vintage") elevator. After settling into my room, I went down to the basement restaurant on that rainy evening. It was full but the lady there found a table for me. I enjoyed my Lamb burger and Petrous.
It’s not too sweet unlike others. Perfect food for a hot temperature. And during weekends, they extend their hours of operation until midnight. So no worry if you are craving for a late night snacks. Service is really great, and all the staffs are very approachable and friendly.

I have been going here for about 8 months now, it is "OK" for the options that around this area. First of all the first review on here about the tanning supplies isn't accurate, at least not for me. My contract hasn't changed at all. I purchased my eye protection from them, they have them right behind the counter, along with other items. You should NOT tan without protection, it can cause serious damage to your eyes, they are trying to protect you! *Pros:* Open 24 Hours Lot's of Aerobic Equipment Staff is friendly in my opinion Lots of weight equipment as well. Large Open Space Pretty much empty before 6AM *Cons:* The equipment is not very clean, think they need more staff working on this. Lack of free weights, think this is a Planet Fitness style, to avoid the "Lunks" Almost every ear phone plug for the TV's on the equipment either doesn't work or is too hard to hear. Bathrooms are not very welcoming either. My remaining issue, really isn't anything directly against Planet Fitness. But just gym etiquette in general, for the love of god people rack your weights!@#!

Даже не знаю, что сказать. Раньше думал, что это чуть ли не лучший хостинг в Украине по соотношению цена-качество. Но, что-то в последнее время начал часто лагать. Вот и в данный момент три моих сайта находятся на этом хостинге в офлайне - глюки с сервером баз данных... Заметил я это полчаса назад. Ладно бы - минута -две, а так уже полчаса! И не понятно, сколько еще мои сайты будут в офлайне... И на телефонные звонки ни по одному из указанных на сайте номеров никто не отвечает. Раньше пользовался хостингом от Мирохоста, так там техподдержка отвечала в любое время суток
Very little food for the price.... over rated....
Look for use-by dates or similar. Not all of their house-brand products have them. Also, nutritional contents on products repacked in the store (e.g., cheese) are sometimes not labeled. Leafy produce seems to contain more dirt than that from other stores. This is their one of their first stores coming up from the south and after merger with Henry’s. I feel the staffing is showing more stress, perhaps due to the chain’s rapid expansion.
Speling mistake Its Tecnia international school
Nice mozzarella and antipasti including free-range chicken. Unfortunately pizza came out burned which considering it isn't the cheapest joint in Rome was unacceptable.
If you don't have 2 hours to spare, this is not the place. The service looks understaffed (3-4 servers for about 50pax), with multiple roles (e.g. server/cashier). Waited 15minutes to get hold of the server to order, 30 minutes for starters to come. Food was decent for its price range but Xananas will be a better choice
Prior to going to Leslies Pool supply in Kernersville I was using the Winston Salem store. I relocated to high Point and began using Leslie Pool Supply in Kernersville. Last summer the clerk "Shawn" was brilliant and very amiable. He was always pleasant and extremely patient. His understanding of the frustrations of the balancing of the pool waters is sometimes present more in the layman then the man with the knowledge and power of the computer. However, this year there is a new clerk and his name is, Kasey. Kasey is rude. I have to say I question his real knowledge of pools and chemicals and the processes in opening the pool. I spent over $500.00 on supplies and chemicals. The vacuum head he suggested did not fit. He was brushing me off with every question I had in regard to replacement parts for my pool cleaning accessories. And, he gave me a chemical to lower my chlorine, which removed all chlorine from the pool and in no time algae was there my pool was emerald green and I still had 3 chemicals to add before the process he gave was complete. When I took the sample to Leslies to remedy the algae growth Kasey said," the water looks clear." (The water is green by reflection of the algae on the pool sides and bottom.) I showed him pictures to help him see the level of green that existed. His comment was, "You really took pictures". While I was there a lady asked about liquid shock, stating the power didn't work as well in her pool. Kasey's response, in a sarcastic and condescending tone was, "Well just mix it with water that makes it a liquid." I was with a friend the first time I was there this season and my friend said when we got to the car, "What was his problem? He was really rude to everyone." I shrugged and tried to brush it off. Putting in the chemicals my son, a micro biologist and chemist asked, "Why are you lowering the chlorine ? Shouldn't you wait till the pool is fully open. Algae could grow." Enough said. It did. Kasey was rude. Yelled in my face when I questioned the lowering of the chlorine before and after the algae incident, saying, "Are u questioning my knowledge. You bring this in here for testing and then you are gonna question my results. Why did you bring it in?" Kasey is in need of some costumer service training or a new job, where he does not deal with the public.
The Health Market is by far superior to other Hyvee's in the area, however, the produce department is extremely neglected as well as other departments. It is not uncommon to come across overly ripe produce, moldy breads, or expired products. Despite the few issues, this location remains my favorite thanks to the health market and friendly personnel.
This McDonalds is horrible!!!!! It was close for several months and just recently reopened. You would think it would be better than before right? WRONG! They have 2 lanes in the drive thru that converge into one. I said it the first time I saw they were doing this...orders are going to get screwed up....and guess what happens....THEY GOT SCREWED UP!!! I get up to the window to get my food, they ask me what my order was not telling me why....then ask me to pull up and wait by the door, the girl comes out and tells me...we accidentally gave out your order to someone else. So not only did my order get screwed up, someone else got the wrong order. It's complete and utter chaos. Plus the people working the drive thru are just standing around doing nothing, playing with the slide door and such. Having worked in a restaurant business before myself, I know that this would be a problem and sure enough it caused peoples orders to get screwed up and I strongly suggest you don't go through the drive thru at this Mc Donalds

Prima tent voor een saté of voor een feestje. Twee keer geweest; geen slechte ervaring.
Accogliente, personale gentile e disponibile, le dimensioni dei piatti sono regolari e i prezzi nella norma. La cucina è realmente "home made" dai sapori genuini. Adatto a famiglie con bambini. D'estate è possibile mangiare in veranda ma i posti sono limitati meglio prenotare. All'interno ci sono due salette ben tenute e arredate. Consigliato.
The property is wonderful, the rooms were great. But the room service and resturant service were very poor. It appeared that everyone what in training the nights that I stayed. No one knew the menu, service was very slow even with a full staff.
Alright atmosphere, but the paper tablecloths really detract from it. Restaurant was moderately busy but there seemed to be plenty of waiters. Service was bad. Took forever, the waiter didn't write anything down and consequently forgot things, didn't give us silverware, and never checked up on us. Food is expensive for what you get. Portions are good, but food is on the bland side. The waiter recommended Brazilian brand Skol beer to me. It was $5, came in a can, tasted like Budweiser, and I didn't even get a glass for it. Not recommended and we won't return. There are better choices in St. Louis at this price point.
It's not easy to find a parking slot.

There isn't much variety for gay bars in Phoenix and Charlie's is probably one of the better choices. The point of focus is the drink specials. Sundays from 4-7 they have 3-for-1 drinks and the bartenders know how to pour a good stiff drink. Thursdays they have 2-for-1 drinks. They also have cheap beer they serve in small pitchers. Probably at least 32 ounces usually around $3-$5. Fridays are the best nights to go in my opinion. This bar is probably the least pretentious gay bar worth going to in Phoenix. Don't expect luxury.

Wanted fish tacos last night. My boyfriend really wanted to go to Rundown Café. We were seated as soon as we arrived which for OBX on a Saturday night should have been a sign of what was to come. I asked for chardonnay to drink. It came room temp.; so I asked for ice. We ordered and waited....It was so loud with people talking that we could hardly have our own conversation. Then we realized that it was hot. My boyfriend was constantly patting his forehead with his napkin to wipe the beaded sweat. Our food arrived and I took my 1st bite into the bland looking fish taco and about got sick. It tasted so fishy. I asked my boyfriend to taste it and he could not eat it either. I am not a person to send food back but I felt I had to let the waitress know. Soon someone came over and offered to discount the meal that I had taken 1 bite of. We agreed and they took 40% off of the bill. What a rip off. We should have asked for the total amount to be discounted but instead just smiled and left. The next time we want fish tacos we will return to Mama Kwans....the best place on the beach for fish tacos!!!!
Great atmosphere but nothing like an Irish pub. The bartender was rude to my mum, wouldn't tell us his name, and couldn't pour a decent pint. They seem to be a bit understaffed. Amazing chowder though!
As Swift terminals go, this is one of the better ones. You have a short walk to Curly's Roadhouse that has a decent steak. The shop was always good, getting me in and out pretty quick. It's real easy to get a load out of Lewiston, but you'll probably be hauling paper. Plus side it was always a drop and hook for me. I hauled K-mart to Missoula so they’d dead head me over here and get a load back home to Denver.

Hubicacion bien apartado de la todo en medio de nada. 4 estrellas para nada, deja mucho que desear. La limpieza no existe, el suelo parece que no lo limpian, huele todo a viejo aunque el hotel es del 2006 parece que lleva allí siglos. El desayuno malo, alimentos no frescos y poca variedad. El café malisimo, con sabor a corrosion de la máquina de café. El spa regular también, un par de chorritos de agua con a penas presión.
The Olive Garden in Middletown has the WORST customer service I have seen in a long time! I have worked in food service so I know at times you get bad employees, I get that... So I usually don't allow that to sway me from eating there too much. But EVERY TIME out of the 3 times I have ordered carry out we have had a problem with the person taking the order and 2 times now I have been treated like I am a huge inconvenience for them when I get there to pick up the order.. I don't say this often but I will NO LONGER spend a dime in that location!

The experience was great. It is entertaining to see what they called the "Flying Roti Man" They have people making the roti for Roti Canai and throw the roti on the air thus the nickname. Their Roti Canai was great but it hurt your pocket in comparison. The only attraction they had for people to come in was to view these "Roti Man" flying those Roti.

I dont know why I like this place, but I do. So many beer options, pretty affordable dogs. Nice people. You have to check it out just for the beer selection.
Very popular cafe place in Santa Cruz de la sierra. It is also found all over Bolivia. The coffee is pretty good specially the lattes and the mocha. The also offer different types of cakes and different types of pies. Also is good for typical food from Bolivia and for the city itself.
Good is not exactly the way it sounds- they aren't bad either. I have been in several times, to see if they would be able to buy or pawn things. At no time have they even really looked at my items before telling me no they don't need them. I try only because they happen to be right down the street so they're convenient. Funny thing though, I can walk straight from them and their NO to a yes with a smile anywhere else I go. Maybe it's just me. Maybe you have to know someone. IDK
Old but accommodating!
I ordered cheese filled bread sticks and pizza. Reminiscent of bulk frozen Sam's Club and Totino's frozen pizza. Laborious "service" with a scowl. Locals joint for folks without the time and/or taste to make it into Cincinnati. Only suitable for the very hungry. The wait time could have been spent driving to something better. The coffee was horrible.

Bom lugar para trabalhar, exceto pelo preço abusivo do estacionamento.
Green Gables is a beautiful atmosphere, a great presentation, but a failure in producing anything with flavor. The meals read and look like pure heaven, but it's a lamplight dinner in a dusty Cleveland alley. Hope they will take more risks in the future.
Food is generally good, service somewhat average. I asked for a small salad instead of fries or rice with my fish. The focus from the waiter was whether I would pay for the salad as an extra side. Really, is the cost significantly different? If the restaurant is full avoid it as there are far too many tables relative to the kitchen. You will wait forever for your meal.

Peaceful place
The IMAX at Navy Pier is quite a venue to watch a movie. I enjoyed the sound, although at times a little loud. I sat in one of the first rows, which made the movie screen too big to watch at times.
Just okay. Iggy's across the street has better chowder. Charged a lot for a can of soda.
First off; I just got my repair done and I just got the car back... secondly... VERY fast work, and great customer service. It was nice to get good service. As for PRICE? It's pretty much the same as everywhere else. Despite it saying fair prices, it's just average. No big deal really... but the problem I have is that after they replaced both my cam and crank sensors, and put a new valve cover gauge (or w/e it's called) I get my car, and by the time I take it home I realize the A/C doesn't work! Now I'm not really a mechanic myself, but I instantly felt like something was wrong. My A/C was perfect before it went into this shop... but anyways, I called up and they said they'll have to take a look at it, but to me it seems like they might have forgotten to put something back on or plug something back in after they fixed my car... which seems almost lazy or forgetful. I'd LOVE to move this review to Excellent status, but I will have to see how they handle my A/C... and see if they're going to try and charge me for it despite it working perfectly fine before they got their hands on my car. I'll update this review when that gets done. I'm hoping those guys fix w/e they did to it and send me on my happy way, because beyond that... these guys seem legit and good. Customer service is awesome, and they were speedy on getting my car fixed, they did call me once, to tell me what was wrong. Hope they fix their faults though!

Great Atmosphere, beautiful location- great to go to Ashridge Estate for a long walk before. Can get extremely busy so would definitely recommend to book- especially at the weekend. Sometimes the service is a very slow due to how busy it gets, but that’s fine as we always enjoy our time there. We always take visitors there as it is so “typically British chic”.
I am happy to know that someone will tell me the truth about my future property!
It's great to have found a store in Xi'an where I can buy some western food items, albeit those things are quite expensive there. Finding what I like is "hit or miss" there, however. Even if I have someone to translate Chinese for me, when I can't find a product they normally carry, the help just replies with "Méiyǒu" (Don't have). No one ever offers to check to see when or if the next shipment will be coming in. They just don't care. Likewise, the checkers at the cash registers are painfully slow. That's not really unique to Metro, however... It's just the way it is in China. Retail workers don't seem to have any motivation. The lack of service also might be partially attributable to the company being a German firm. If you have ever spent time in Germany, you know of their appalling lack of "customer service" in the country. I'm not picking on Germany... That's just part of the corporate culture there. (Even my German relatives often complain of poor service in Germany.) Still, shortcomings aside, at least I can sometimes find authentic German bread and some imported cheeses and a couple of kinds of mustard, such as American and Dijon. While I'm happy to find those, I'm a little surprised they don't carry Germany's most popular brand of mustard, "Bautzner". As I mentioned, be prepared for sticker-shock, however. A small plastic squeeze bottle of French's American Mustard will set you back about US$5. The price of cheese will give you a heart attack faster than the cheese. They have a fair selection of authentic German beers. Expect to pay at least US$30 for a 5 liter "draft" can. That same beer would probably cost about the same in the US, although it would probably cost only 1/3 of that in Germany. I can also find good quality olive oil at a cheaper price than Walmart or Vanguard. So overall, on Google's 0-3 scale, I would give this Metro store a 2 on Quality, a 2 on Appeal, but only a 0 on Service. As of October 2012, I have heard the Metro just opened a new store in the eastern part of Xi'an. It may be closer for me than the current location. I plan on checking it out, then will write a review of that location as well.
I began visiting the Blue Grill in Milford about a year ago. A few revisits over the past year haven't dampened my enthusiasm for the food here. Both the beef and chicken shawarma remain excellent. Ask for the garlic sauce, some tomatoes, cucumbers and onions and along with the rice and lettuce, you have a meal that will fill you up and put a smile on your face. The hummus tastes homemade and a mile better than the stuff you can purchase at the stores. I simply have never had a bad meal here. Now, the downside. I used to frequent this place when it was Stucchi's Ice Cream. The wood floor gleamed and was spotless. Since it's been the Blue Grill I'll be they haven't actually cleaned the floor (other than sweeping it) once. The back entry way floors are also obviously dirty, dirty, dirty as are the floors in the main dining area. The sill under the windows had dead flies and the bin for plastic bottles was overflowing. This place has great food. What it needs now is management to put some of the employees to work cleaning and keeping the place up because the cleanliness of this is really beginning to put me off.

First the good things.. - The coffee is great - food is really good - atmosphere is relaxed, very much like Capitol Hill coffee shops - easy access to parking Now for the bad parts. - No Wifi (not even pay for Wifi) - No power outlets - your laptop is on battery power only! :( - No Credit/Debit Card accepted <-- wha? - They discourage lounging, ie to much studying, talking or computer usage when they get crowded. Serious - check the 'rules' section of web site. For coffee shop thats 10 minutes from Microsoft's main campus I can NOT fathom how this place survives. It has so much potential to be a great east side substitute for relaxed old school neighborhood Seattle brew house. However, its shortcomings are too significant.

I was having some brake issues so I took my car in to have it looked at. They said I needed 4 new rotors and brake pads, it was all going to be $740. I called my mechanic back home and he could do it for $350. Needless to say I will be driving it home to have it fixed. Th service was fine and I wasn't charged, but you can expect to find much cheaper rates elsewhere.

I can't say about the food because I didn't stay for it. The restaurant was dead when I walked in. Only one occupied table. The host was in a corner with his back to the door, on his phone. I know the cook saw me, we made eye contact twice, but neither greeted me or acknowledged my existence. I left after 3-5 minutes of this horrible service.

I've just had dinner at this place. I've ordered the Japanese Teriyaki dish with chicken. It was just fine until I took a bite out of one piece of chicken and it was awful! It tasted like it was either old or someone must have rubbed their sweaty privates on it. I am disgusted and disappointed. This was my first AND last visit to this diner. I do not recommend this place for Asian cuisine. Other than the food, everything else was good.
First, we looked at the setup. It appears to be manually heated. The spring may have died some years ago, and they built a heater to keep budiness. Hot Springs have green water and smell of sulfur. Not this place. Second, we tried to ho back after dark....Dont be fooled when they tell you its open till midnight. Thats a lie by disinformation. They cut admission at 10pm but make it sound like you can go anytime before midnight. The gate guy rejected us at 1030. We begged "please make an exception, we just drove 4 hours from denver, its my birthday"-all true. They guy wouldnt even look up or make eye contact. We wont return.
Just not comfortable with her style. She is a testing maniac. Care was decent but both times I brought my kids in and she referred them for other tests, completely unrelated to the reason that I brought them in "just to be sure". She is a milk Nazi - like she's getting a kickback from the dairy board. Wants no juice of any kind, even 100% or diluted. How realistic is that? I agree with the other reviewer that she doesn't seem to really want to work with you as a parent. She lays down the standard medical protocol and that's that. I left both times with a vague feeling that she was looking for billable issues too. Probably wasn't but that's the aftertaste of the visits. I think she provides decent care. It's just a bedside manner/style issue. My other peds seemed more open to working with me as a partner in my children's care. I like that. I'm comfortable with that and I will be looking for another pediatrician who provides that.
Pizza's great. Best in a 5mile radius. But service is extremely slow... bigger location needed ...
Disappointing food and the service has been poor on two occasions now. First visit we were stared at all night and second visit we were hovered around and rushed out the door. If the food was better I could overlook bad service but, sadly, it is not.
Otimos quartos amei td isso e recomendo....
Not the worst MetroPCS store i've been to but still pretty bad. Not very knowledgeable of activation procedures, at one point she actually asked me how to do it. Charged me $20 for SIM instead of $10 but at least didnt try to throw on an activation fee.
I have fees imformation for treatment...
food was good , service was good . I will go back again
The pancakes were good, bacon was tasty and a nice portion. Quick service. Coffee wasn't very good, and the omelettes come from a carton/batter.
Bien sans plus. Pas de bar à la plage en tout compris et serviettes payantes.
I went to Texas Road House wanting to like it. Some of my extended family went just after it opened and were not impresses. My wife and I just went there on a date. I will say that the service was great. We were seated fast and served well. However the food was terrible. I ordered a Berger with fries and had a onion flower as an entree. This is one of my favorites to get at other restaurants in the chain. Everything was so salty that I couldn't handle more than a couple of bites. On top of that they burnt my Berger. The mistakes were managed well and they let me order some pulled pork instead. That was better but still nothing to write home about. My walk away conclusion is that until they find better chefs I will not waste my time and money by eating there in the near future. I might try it again in a year or if I hear from people that I trust that they have improved their food.
The location and food was good, however dreadful service. Both waitresses were absolutely rude, annoyed that I asked about something on the menu, or anytime we ordered something.
Estou cursando no momento.
The food is good and its in a very good location. The wait staff is not very smart or discrete. I asked for a duplicate check so as to pay the bill without anyone at the table knowing. The wait staff proceeded to make a production out of it in front of the other patrons. They REALLY EMBARESSED OUR PARTY!!! Then when we went to pay the bill the lady was on the phone and couldnt figure out the correct change
Nice fish.
Food was good, especially the shrimp taco!

Onion rings I suspect were the frozen variety. Don't. The rest of our food was very good. We usually don't order drinks, just water. Those of you who simply drink water should be able to identify with the problems we encounter. You are lucky to get a refill. If you aren't buying drinks, you pretty much have to choke down your food. The water glass is as small as you can imagine. When the waitress finally returned to our table to ask if we wanted desert, she failed to notice that not only had we drank what little water we had been served, we had also chewed the ice for moisture. Sorry but there is no excuse for this. Leave us a pitcher if you have too many tables to deal with.
Ok, so I go there because everyone was raving about the place. The wait was long so they suggested I sit at the bar, hostess gets an excellent rating for seating me promptly, valets were great too. When I sit down the bartender (when he finally recognized my existence, since I wasnt in a mini skirt) hands me a "happy hour" menu where I order my food from, here is where it went downhill. First off they claim its a 7oz steak...ya pre-cooked and pre-trimmed. I honestly think I could floss more steak from my teeth than they served on that plate and to top it off I was charged 18 dollars. When I finally got the bartender to stop playing slap and tickle with all the female patrons, seriously it was like he was trying to be Tom Cruise in Cocktails, if it wasnt so sad it would have been funny. But I asked him why my steak was almost double what it said on the menu, his response "oh that was happy hour pricing" and said it like I was the idiot for not knowing that. Bottom line, it wasnt worth anywhere 18 bucks, but I paid, and left...never to return. NOT worth the cost and hassle, unless you are 'one of the cool kids' (or female) that seem to all know each other and the only ones that got decent service.

The clothes were in good shape, and there were lots of brand names, but they allow only 3 days for returns, and only for exchange or store credit. And there are no carts, only hand baskets.

I have attempted to try Starbucks coffee many times before. Again this morning I went through the drive through and explained what type of coffee I was looking for. The young lady on the other end just stated "I like have no idea what you're asking for". I can not stand going to places that are stuck up and act as if they are better than you. I've been to this location a few different times and got the same reaction. As well as a few other locations. Hopefully one day I will be able to try their coffee.
Decent course. Nothing special...kind of on the pricey side. I would have rated a 4, but no military discount.
The go to pizza after the bar or a few drinks. No frills stuff here but the grease tastes great after enough drinks.
If you are drunk and hungry at 2am, there is no better place around. If you are sober and just looking to grab a bite to eat, look elsewhere. There are better hot dogs less than a mile away.
Drive thru is always extremely slow.
Perfect place for lunch or even breakfast. The service is very great, and the staffs are very kind and attentive. Very interesting and fulfilling. This place is really worth the visit. Surely deserved to be highly recommended.
Доброго ранку, Одесо!
Una buena hamburguesa, con buena relación calidad-precio pero sin un sabor que realmente la haga destacable. Buenas opciones de carta para hamburguesa, aunque sin ser excesivas. Destacables los postres.
Its probably the most north-west point to exit from Bashundhara Residential Area. People have to pass on foot coz vehicles are not allowed to cross the gate. There are street shops around with lots of chaos all the time. There is also a bazaar. All kinds of people go there for shopping as goods are cheaper in comparison to the shops at the front gate.
For the most part, I like living at Autumn Park. Office staff and maintenance crew are generally cooperative; maintenance requests are handled capably. Great having 24-hour laundry facilities, pool and gym. Rent is pretty reasonable.
Our experience last week was disappointing. ..dusty plates...mediocre service...
I visited ARG today for the first time in several years. I travel frequently throughout the US and often visit local gyms for a quick boulder or lead session. ARG is a little hard to find because there is no sign out front. However the google maps directions are accurate. The hours are really limited. I am shocked that they don't open until 3 pm. While $15 is pretty standard pricing for a day pass, I found the gym in a sorry state of repair. The carpeted floor was torn in many places. It hasn't been vacuumed in weeks or more. The bathroom clearly doesn't get daily cleaning. There were ample route and problems selections (V0-V8). There were few hard problems, but that is fine if you just want a workout. I am very surprised that Austin doesn't have a competing gym given it's size in 2014.
Our party of five had a sampling of several menu items, about half of which was okay and the other half terrible. The staff adamantly refused to remove one of the terrible meals from our bill after we requested a substitute entree. The service was spotty, extremely slow and made several mistakes. The only bright spot of this visit was the view of Seneca Rocks. I highly recommend going elsewhere.

Wir waren mit Groupon in der Tapasbar Summerrose. Der Empfang war meiner Meinung nach zu kühl, die Bedienung ist erst nach dem zweiten Gang aufgetaut. Wir hatten eine Vorspeise (Gazpacho, schmeckte leider nicht selbst gemacht...), einen Zwischengang (Garnelen in Knoblauchsoße, wobei vom Knoblauch nicht viel zu spüren war und die Garnelen noch komplett mit Schale waren), ein Hauptgericht (Tortilla mit Hähnchen, das war lecker, aber nichts besonderes...) und einen süßen Nachtisch. Der Wein war lecker, die Location ist nett, die Bedienung könnte freundlicher sein und das Essen ist leider nichts besonderes...
Airport is well maintained, it is beautiful, traditional Kerla architecture. What I didn't like is quality of food available, bought Pizza for Rs 120, and it was pathetic 4" home made non-veg pizza with hardened chicken like rubber, and tomato sauce topping with only onion and tomato. This is kerla is tourist destination, was expecting good food options. Special for tourist who will be travelling to different locations from here

Possibly the Valley's only true mid-size concert venue. Tickets are sometimes reasonably priced and the venue often attracts desirable indie/alternative bands. Expect to go through airport style security when you attend a show here. No liquids over 3 oz. You must remove your shoes and submit to a pat-down. Bouncers are omnipresent, thuggish and never there when you need one. Once inside the terminal don't expect to drown your sorrows in alcohol. Six dollars for pints of PBR, Bud and Bud Light, seven dollar craft and crafty brews, eight dollar well drinks. Expect long delays between sets (30-45 minutes) with little or nothing to entertain you. There is ABSOLUTELY NO RE-ENTRY so you must pick up your merch on the way out. All in all, you can have much the same experience by going to the airport and turning up the tunes. Sweaty, wild eyed will people surround and jostle you. Things are overpriced. You can't leave. Everyone hates the management. If you love airports, this is the venue for you.

Don't buy a timeshare from these guys! The sales people will tell you anything to get a sale then when you meet with the guy to do a new owner orientation all he does is tell you, you basically got screwed and he doesn't know what you were told by the sales person. Then spends the rest of the time showing you what you could do if you buy something else. Lot's of passing the buck, but the bottom line is they want you to pay $10k-15k to buy the timeshare, annual dues of $210 and then pay $150-$500 average if you want to plan a vacation more than a month in advance. They tell you that you can plan in advance in the presentation, but then in your orientation they tell you completely different, 90 days later BTW. Scam, Scam, Scam...

Hmm... I totally understand the other poster's sentiment regarding ridiculous charges (I know from experience that you are best off ordering from their website; corporate is a whole different beast than retail, and MUCH more consumer friendly/helpful). However, I called in to the store regarding an update issue that has been plaguing my poor phone in regards to the Android 4.3 update, and the person I talked to actually had useful ideas. By contrast, the Fullerton store has the most useless staff I've ever encountered - NEVER go there. Anyway, he explained that there is really nothing to do besides a diagnostic (because it's most likely just an OS/Sprint system issue), but explained a workaround that I could easily do myself involving a factory reset to my device. Good info that I will probably try if my system update continues to fail; minus a star because he didn't tell me his name and his greeting was extremely abrupt.

De fato, o atendimento é bastante bom. As pizzas, então, são ótimas. Olha que já comi em um monte de lugar no Rio e em São Paulo que não chegavam nem perto. O preço acaba sendo um pouco salgado, mas vale a pena de vez em quando.
Better, got there in the end.
I don't know what the other "feminine impersonator shows" of Chicago are like, but I would skip this one. The "girls" just dance and lip-sync. I go to a great show in Alton, Illinois where there is crowd interaction, stand up and a better show. I was not impressed. Cover is $10 on a Thursday or $15 on a weekend, PLUS the 2 drink min. My drinks were great, but cost $12 each. My mom had a simple Malibu mixture that cost $7 and a cola that cost $4.25 and then they add in 16% tip, regardless of the number in your group.

I ordered the shrimp enchilada, and the server brought my a chicken enchilada... Few minutes after, I mentioned the mix-up to the server but told her that I was happy with the chicken and not to worry about... Then the manager came out and that is when my good experience turned horrible. He proceeded to say with a smart tone in his voice: "I see that you got the chicken instead of the shrimp. The chicken tastes better and it is cheaper. So you lucked out". I replied that I would not know since I did not have a chance to try the shrimp, and then he replied: "That's good. The chicken is better and you saved a few bucks. Good for you!" You can imagine my surprise at his attitude and comment! To top it off, when I left the valet guy was gone, and I had to circle around for 15 minutes to find somebody to give me my keys back......

Ojo, hay unos tipos que roban los notebooks. Primero entra uno de terno hablando por celular -antiguo- mirando indiscriminadamente todas las mesas (las partes de abajo). Luego sale... Poco después entra otro más informal... El lleva una mochila y se sienta al lado de la "víctima". Hacen como que conversan y a penas se descuidan sacan algo. Salen y se van lo más tranqui. Ojo que afuera hay otro más que avisa por si viene alguien. Todos arriba de 40 años.
The staff can be a little short in attitude for no reason especially if you are alone. Great coffee though
Just had a yummy breakfact for dinner.
Lo que menos me gusta de un sitio es salir con la sensación de que me han timado. Vulnerando varias leyes y derechos del consumidor, en este lugar te van a cobrar, sin avisarte, por sentarte (4 euros por persona), por el pan, y por diversas cosas que van trayendo sin solicitarlas y de las que no vas a conocer el precio hasta verlo en la cuenta. No ya por no saber que vas a dejarte la pasta, sino porque aún así, exprimen de donde más molesta. Prefiero que me digan lo que va a valer desde el principio, que es derecho de consumidor. Al margen de eso, la carne estaba buena y en su punto.

I had an extremely pleasant experience when I first came here late august 2012. This was the 4th bridal shop that I had been to that day and they made the dress trying on feel like something you would see off of tv, which is why I decided to buy my dress from them. I ordered my Eddy K dress on January 12th, 2013 and was told that the dress would take at maximum 6 months to get in, which was fine because my wedding wasn't until October. June came and went no dress..... July came and went, still no dress..... By mid august I had made quite a few phone calls to them with no response back. So I went into the store and they said that the dress would be in the first week of September. Okay.... Second week of September I started calling again, and again no phone call back. My dress finally came in the third week of September, of course I got 2 phone calls the day the dress came in. I paid full price for the dress. Now I have less than a month to get the alterations I need done. Needless to say I kinda got screwed over on this deal.

Decent, and convenient. If you work in the building that is. They seem to run out of things semi-regularly.
I've been to various locations of Umami and this one by far was the worst with the service the waiter seem disinterested in being at work as a whole and didn't even acknowledge nor honor my student discount. Next time I will just call the manager to assist with these situations. All in all food is ok gets less and less "gourmet" the more you eat it. I call it my "once in a while place".

January 2013 I am a Chef and I shop at this food lion sometime. it is close to my home and conveniently situated off the expressway on the way home. I often get what I need for my home here, but I have noticed that the buyers do not stock this store with the same quality of fresh food items as I see in the other like names stores. Namely Colonial Heights and Chester. (that food) I started this review off giving this store 4 stars but because of poor customer service I think I will drop it down to 3 stars. (January 28, 2013) Called the 800# to get a direct line to this store. Called and asked about sleds. with out even checking, i was told no we do not have any. I said I was there last night (8:00pm) you're out of them completely? "I'm assuming that we are cause I don't see any." ***CLICK*** WHAT THE HECK DID SHE JUST HANG UP ON ME? OMG. We really need to train staff on proper phone etiquette. Thanks loyally Food Lion customer, Willing to go out of the way to avoid this poor service.
Overrated. Fun place but very mediocre food.
I went to this place last nite and i tell u the 1st thing is is very hard to find 2nd the food nearly killed me and the 3rd the prices were over the top for what u get. I ordered the Fajitia as a joined plate with my husband, i explained to the waitress that i am allergic to Capsicum, which she noted down and when our meal arrived i looked at it and was starting to eat when i noticed that the WHOLE meal was laced with Capsicum..... I spoke with the waitress and she was very shocked that i recieved it,[], after checking with the kitchen staff they thought only part of the meal was for me but it is a MEAL for 2!! I was so angry that i asked for the manager and i told him the story and he double checked with the kitchen staff and the computer thingy they use to make sure that the waitress wrote down the correct order WHICH she did may i add, he come back asking me what i wished to do and repeated that i wouldn't be paying for a meal that could kill me...... He couldn't do enough for me after that. As for the pricing that well when u look at the menu PAY attention to the Fajita's for 2 is double the price got figure that out but it is a shared meal so y pay for 1 meal twice???? Decor was fair, service slow at times but place was busy..... Neaver eating there AGAIN i am sorry.
With Disney I have come to expect excellence.Maybe this is because I have stayed at Animal Kingdom and Wilderness Lodge Resorts in the past. The Coronado was not living up to the same standards. True the resort is spread out and requires a lot of walking, but this maybe should be obvious based on the layout mapped out when booking. There are 4 bus stop locations. If you stay near the 4th stop it is sometimes difficult to get a bus. If full, they skip the 4th stop. The bathroom area in the room was disappointing. The shower had mildew which caused an odor. After complaining about the smell and mildew, I was told they would clean it, but nothing was done. Later I complained it was not clean. They appeared to try to do something, but maybe not enough. They did give our kids to plush Minnie Mouse dolls. But nothing which would make me run back or walk back this this resort. Ordered pizza in the room after a long day at the park as kids were tired. When ordering they said it would take an hour. An hour and a half later still no pizza. Not much longer after that the pizza finally did come, but it was sub-par at best.

Always be aware of a man dressed in chefs garb who drags customers off the street. The atmosphere is good. Service good... our food was poor. Only eat here if your hungry.
Sitting here while wife received her dinner 10 minutes ago and still have not received my food. Seems to be run by high schoolers as the servers hangout at the tables with their friends. Finally just got food and no apology at all. Sad place. Won't be back.
Food was alright. Nuggets were fresh.. Fries were kind of cold though even after waiting for fresh nuggets. Requested BBQ for both my nuggets and fries. Only received one sauce cup. Kinda lame and ruined the meal. I'm a man who loves BBQ sauce.

They recently completely changed the menu. Both of our favorite drinks are no longer available, and their replacements were not to our liking at all. Also, their largest drinks are smaller than they used to be, so for those that really like coffee... you have to buy more to get the same amount you used to. Roots - PLEASE bring the old menu back!

This is a good coffee place compared to the rest around it like ctc cinnabon espresso etc. I visit this branch whenever i come to Lahore. Few years back it shifted from accross the road to this new localilty but i would say the old one was better. Initially they use to sell many different bean flavored coffee but now they restricted to one selected bean hub! Means you cant select bean of ur choice. Any how i still like it

As always certain quality limits apply to every service, no matter what general category they serve in. Despite being an auto service, Parker Automotive, stands solid behind those limits. Their shop is exceptionally clean. I've seen houses dirtier than their shop. Seriously this is a big impression. It shows that a lot of effort is put everyday. Very good thing, considering 90% of the humans on the planet are just begging for the work day to end....
L'année dernière, c'était long et horriblement sale. Cette année, c'est beaucoup mieux !
The only thing that really makes this place good is the convenience. It's in the unpaid area of the NJ Turnpike and it's right on the NY/NJ buffer zones for cross-state stops. Otherwise, the food seems more Microwaved and the beverages seem like they're water with a bit of flavor and more watered down in the end. Fuel prices are average but way lower than NYC. If it can wait, find a local petroleum station. It's only for the better.

Покупал посудомоечную машину в подарок. Попросил доставить перед днем рождения. В итоге позвонили заранее и перенесли на следующий день.

Терминал для приема безналичных платежей отказывался работать минут 20 (вынимали батарейку, звонили в диспетчерскую, ходили на улицу, чтобы поймать сигнал). Посудомойка стоила дороже на 1 500, чем у некоторых конкурентов, но мойка была в наличии и была возможность оплаты безналом. Поэтому и выбрал этот магазин. К грузчикам претензий не имею.

I was at the red piano for a Bachelorette Party for my coworker last Friday (Feb 1). We had a reservation for 10 people and when we got there (at 7pm) they had us split into two booths. It was very hard to talk to everyone and was fairly cramped in the booths. We asked to combine two tables together and were told that they were reserved for tables for 4 people. We then ordered dinner at 730 and did not receive our meals till 845 pm. We were all very hungry and did not have the patience to send back our cold food. We assumed why it took 1 hour and 45 mins to get our food (Spaghetti and meat balls and a burger) was due to wanting to charge us for the entertainment fee which was applied after 9pm. Our waitress was fairly tentative at the beginning and then we went almost 30 mins without seeing her, and had our empty plates in front of us for at least 30 mins. The entertainment was good though (dueling pianos), they were funny and interacted with the crowd very well.

I ordered from this warehouse and 2 weeks later heard nothing. I emailed asking if something was back-ordered and they were waiting on it. They assured me they were just busy. Two weeks after that I get an email saying they don't have some things in stock and that they will be shipping what they have to me. So that was very frustrating. I received part of my order and expected the rest to be sent shortly. Two weeks later the rest of the order shipped. I got no acknowledgement of poor service or apology. Maybe its not warranted but it definitely was not the what I expected. I will be purchasing my next order from Northern Brewing.

We ordered a Cajun pizza and the dough and ingredients seemed to be good and high quality but the seasoning was too salty. I would be willing to try it again but would order a different pizza.
Perhaps being a bit above itself to call it a Gastropub, but definitely trying - which can only be encouraged in the area. Manages admirably to define country pub for regulars with separate dining area(s) where individual tastes are catered for. Staff are friendly when one can get their attention and this is perhaps the crucial point of enjoyment - SAY "I'd like my vegetables steamed and a bit al dente" and they came that way - on a previous visit I'd been sad to be given (in my opinion) completely overcooked vegetables - and I'd complained - only to be told that "that was how most people liked them, why didn't you say?" Staff are good and will accommodate most requests - but only if asked - after asking it's never a problem, but one does need to actually say something.
I like Sams if you are new to Sams pizza it can be thin crust. Yet, you can order double crust which I think is allot better. I like the 2x crust Sams special -anchovies add peppercinines (aka yellow peppers). Which for the value is around $15 which for all those topping is a value. Sams has been around for a while and Sam does not treat his employees very well. Dictatorship which means he has total control over the place. Which also means the employees are not very happy to be yelled at. Don't be surprised if he yells at an employee in front of you and your family with no apology. The pizza Nazi, is it worth it that decision is yours.

Great place to go if you want really cheap, large drinks that taste great. It's a dive bar so you you get what you pay for but if you want just a nice chill night to relax, then this is the place to go.
The only thing that I admire most is their green tea ice-cream. Other disks are horrible. I have tried different types of Sushi in Japan and other areas in Asia. I like Asian style sushi, not Americanized Sushi. I've also tried different Sushi places in Provo. However, I've not found a good one yet!
It's a fine Hampton Inn but it has virtually no internet connection. Close to the interstate and a few restaurants within walking distance. If it wasn't for the lack of internet I'd keep this location in the regular line up.
Har vært hos Dattra til Hagen og drukket øl mang en gang og koset meg og fredag fant vi ut at vi skulle ta turen for en øl og en matbit etter jobb. Burgerne var helt konge, men min kollega fikk servert en carbonara som var en smakløs pasta-med-eggerøre. En carbonara skal ikke være pasta-med-eggerøre og den var klart overstekt. Min venn ga indirekte tilbakemelding om dette og ba servitrisen om å ta den bort uten å spise av den. Vi andre rundt bordet forsikret han om at de sikkert kom til å komme med en ny en siden dette er ganske vanlig når en ikke er fornøyd med en feillaget rett. Det skjedde ikke. Jeg dro litt før de andre og betalte derfor i baren. Fortalte da hva som hadde skjedd til de bak baren og fikk som svar "Hva har det med din burger å gjøre?". "Ikke noe" svarte jeg, "men dere har kanskje noe å fikse opp i der, dere serverte en feillaget rett som ikke ble spist." Hun bak baren svarte "Åja", men ingen ting skjedde. Kollegaen min endte opp med å betale full pris for en feillaget rett han ikke rørte og de som jobbet der fikk flere muligheter til å fikse opp i det. Dårligste servicen jeg har sett på et spisested i Norge.
Is no longer in business, since 5/13:(
The food is okay and I thought the service was a bit slow. Then I find out the waitress over charged my credit card by $10. She also over charged two of my co-workers cards as well. Mistake? It's hard to say. The manager was nice enough to refund my card but didn't anything else.
Worst customer service I've ever experienced in a long time. I've been there for a slice before which was good but not great. However when I tried to order from there, the person on the phone had no customer service skills whatsoever and before I can complete my order they hung up. Thinking the food was on it's way I waited, only to find out the order was never put in. A few months later I decided to give them another chance and call for an order only to have the same thing happen only this time the person on the phone was even more rude. I guess they feel they can afford having terrible customer service. Never again.

Some of the best beer in town, however in the recent years their prices have gone through the roof, especially for the food. Used to love locals night, but now it isn't even worth it. It turned into the sort of thing that will cause locals to stay at home on Monday nights.

Service - 5/10. Difficult to find servers with a smile. Food - 6/10. Whoever has heard of Kaathi roll being served cold !!! They have butchered one of the most authentic eatery item.. Egg Biryani was ok though. Price - $$$ Definitely not in my re-visiting list.
I'm a member and I'm generally happy with most of the things and just ignore other small stuff. I would recomend it to you, only if you never plan to visit this gym during peak hours, you don't want to pay much and you can close your eyes at some things. Pros: spacious, lots of equipment, easy parking, indoor pool, cheap. Cons: crowded during peak hours, posers, leaving towels on the floor is OK for many in this gym for some reason.
Yeah
They have a good selection of beuty products.

. We checked into the Internatonal Palms resort wednesday August 15th. We were excited by the hotels pictures. Upon arriving we were happy with the apperance of the room but thought the placement of our room felt more like a college dorm. There were unruly teenages running up and down the hallway kncking on the doors at all hours of the night. Wen I woke up in the middle of the night found some roaches in the bathroom and didnt think much of it because it happens. However the next morning our crossaints which were in a tight plastic container had 4 roaches inside of them. There were roaches all behind our TV. I took the box of crossaints to the front desk and complained- we were given a voucher for a free breakfast. While we were at the pool there was roaches crawling around the side of the pool. The last straw came when I awoke that night with two roaches in our bed. I called front desk to complain and asked the staff named Ahmed if I could have corporaes number. He stated there was not a number to corporate and that he was the manager on call. He stated he could move me to another room but if I didnt like that room that there were plenty of other rooms in other hotels in Orlando. So at 1230am I packed up my two small children and changed rooms to another building. That room also had roaches in the tub. We went out and bought roach spray because we didnt want to pack up and move our children again. Upon checking out we discovered that Ahmed was not a manager and that all they could do was discount our resort fees. I wouldnt stay here again or even recommend it. The positive is that the atrium building had a great view of Harry Potter and Sebastian at the front desk was very helpful with checkin and they do have great discount park ticket prices. but overall It was a horrible experience and not happy with how Ahmed at front desk treated us
A very basic Thai cuisine oriented Restaurant.

My husband and I drove from Yukon over to Red Coyote today to look for me some running shoes , we walked in the store and there were 2-3 people behind the counter and 2 people on the floor. We walked in and not one person said Hi, Hello or Welcome not even a nod!!! Went over to the running shoes and looked at them for about 15 mins and no one even approached us not even to say "we will be with you in a moment" or anything. This was my first and last visit to this store, I had read great reviews about the store and thought this would be the perfert place to help me find the perfect running shoe, but ......I was wrong!! Oh well I guess I had to try!!! Brenda Hooper
The only good thing about this place is the crust. Best I've ever had. It's sad that everything else was so terrible. We waited 15 minutes after sitting down before being asked what we wanted to drink. The pizzas (2) took slightly longer than I would expect but not long enough to complain about. Upon receiving them I immediately noticed there was way too much cheese. They attempted to cut through it's inch thick layer of cheese but were unsuccessful and I had to do it. The toppings were unevenly distributed and the black olives and cheese were all I could taste. When I did occasionally taste another topping, it was amazing. The glasses are small and I ran out of water fast and had to flag down the waitress to get more since she was busy chatting it up with another table the whole time. Overall terrible experience and I should have just gone to Pizza Hut. I won't be going back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.

NOS VAMOS A LA PISTA DE HIELO HACE AÑOS QUE NO VOY PERO HOY TENEMOS QUE IR A FESTEJAR A MI AMIGA LLUVIA CON SUS HIJOS A LA PISTA DE HIELO SERA DIVERTIDO
I'm pretty ticked off by this place. I've spent at least $100 1-2x a week for the last month and a half. I just left Nisen with another $100 of sushi and asked if they could give me the 20% "customer appreciation discount" coupon that's on their website. I told her I've been renovating my house for the last month and had no printer. Yet, She said, "No, sorry". Well, now your business is sorry because this isn't the first time Nisen has done something that turned me off. So, this girl couldn't give me a 20% off discount because I didn't have a printed out generic coupon from their website? LOL. What a joke! Every time I've gone to pick up an order I've had a problem with the service here. The girls at the front desk are airheads. They are completely clueless about running a restaurant. Obviously they were hired for something other than experience. I had a screaming infant in the car last week and the girls told me my pickup order would be ready in 20 minutes. I ended up waiting with a teething, freaking out baby, in my car for an HOUR.. for pick up! I told them this was happening and they just smiled and spaced out saying, "Oh, I don't know... they must be backed up or something." Uh, the place was not busy. It was maybe 6:30/7 pm on a Wednesday? The sushi? Great.. Although twice, I picked up my order and there was NO SOY SAUCE. That's like picking up a cheeseburger with no ketchup. Not giving me a 20% off coupon when I've been in regularly and have a legit excuse for not having a physical piece of paper on me is just like saying, "I don't give a sh*t about my customers". So Nisen, I don't give a sh*t about giving you my money anymore. Hope the 20% funds you well. =]
Went here once. The service was fine, the food acceptable, but wasn't that great. I probably won't come back here often with the other options in this area. Portions are pretty nice, but like I said, it ain't that great.
Excellent Food in out skirt area of bhuj and passing people of Bhuj-Anjar Highway!

For future reference, auto detailing service is by appointment--which is understandable except nothing about their signage or answering service clarifies this. They do a good job but the communication and customer service needs a lot of improvement. I've only been there twice and despite my phone calls and online research, I've just had to take a gamble and hope they were open and available. I prefer to take my business somewhere with more clear expectations.
Une des plus jolies terrasses du quartier, souvent prise d'assaut désormais, n'hésitez pas à arriver tôt ou tard, parfait pour les horaires décalés. Cuisine en nette progrès ces derniers temps ! Et un rapport qualité/prix en hausse donc.

Won't go to them since all they post up is a fax number. Plus this is a verified by owner listing. Pretty dumb, would hate to see the mistakes they do on my ride.
Food was cold, service was decent but they have definitely gotten worse since the last time I was here.

I love pizza, and I have no beef with the establishment but this is the worst pizza I have ever had. Elios frozen pizza is better. The only thing I can say good about the food is that the salad was average. My daughter and I took home the pizza we did not eat so the family would beleive us when we told them how bad the pizza was.Their box says "A little slice of heaven" on it. That is the running joke in our family. Well I thank Mystic Pizza for that.
Lakeside's medical staff is great....their billing department SUCKS! I've tried to pay them and get info so I could pay them and you can't find anyone. Then they turn you over to a collection agency without explanation.
I was a little worried when dealing with Acadia but heard nothing but good personal reviews from neighbors. He removed a skin tumor from my Pit and I have never had any issues. They have great prices and my two dogs and two cats get all their annual vaccines through him. He had been a vet for YEARS and is well-known throughout Tulsa.
The menu was limited but quality was high. The ambiance is great and definitely lets you know you're in Latin America. The only drawback was I was stupid enough to somehow leave my phone behind and when I went to retrieve it they didn't have it. Again, just another taste of Latin America for you. Even so, I recommend the place.

Service with a piece of indifference. The calamari meal I had was over spiced and dry, and the spices were sandy. I ate half then left it as a waste of a meal but there was no interest in the fact my plate still had food on it. When I said the chili was too much, there was no room for any other flavour, and the spices were gritty, I was told other people like it and no-one else has complained, and that is the way it should be. I said it needed a dressing of some kind to marry the textures together and was told it was fine as it was. No interest, couldnt wait to get the plate off the table and be gone. Service varies; some staff are good but there are a couple of who seem marginally annoyed at having to serve.

I called in today to see about scheduling my appointment for breast augmentation and I was hung up on 3 times - the day I initially went; the receptionist didn't even acknowledge that I was there until a couple minutes afterward and I was standing in front of her. I understand that they give a good price and I've heard that the doctor is really good but I feel like you don't treat patients or future patients like that - Teresa who is the person I met with was awesome...she was very knowledgeable and answered all my questions - she didn't hurry me and took her time answering all my questions and honestly makes you feel comfortable with the decision but the attention that the front desk people took in helping me wasn't very good - even if I did get surgery and I called in because I had an issue or of a concern that I wasn't feeling well and I got hung up three times; to me that is frustrating. I thought I would email because it is something that could be improved - other than that...Teresa was awesome and of great help for the knowledge she has.

The reason why Ledingham Properties even received a good rating as far as I'm concerned is the fact that they seem to want to perpetuate the mystique of a "safe" neighborhood, which if anyone even checks out KSL knows is not true of Salt Lake City, unless you can afford to pay buckets of money in rent. I happen to be old enough to have a past and this management company doesn't seem to be sympathetic toward an individual who happens to work hard for a living and has learned from her past. I just wonder how many pedophiles, and practicing criminals they currently have residing in their precious homes/condos. I'm not afraid to voice my displeasure in the fact that although they will not reconsider their stance towards good people who have made mistakes in the past they continue to perpetuate a lie "Salt Lake City" is not a "safe" city, check out the news and judge for yourself. I still think that it is admirable that they want to protect themselves from me and others "good for them", I wonder what happens when their children need a rental?
They waived my check cashing fee and made me happy so that shows they do care not only about just there account holders. Bravo u get 3 stars now

Service was fine, food was aweful. Had to go home to grill my panini because the cheese was not melted, not even warm! Hardly any grill marks on the outside. VERY disappointing, The breakfast oatmeal bar was nearly burnt and really hard to bite into. I had to dunk it in coffee to not break my teeth on it! I usually go to the Wendy's by my work in Natomas. Will stick to them since their food is always hot, fresh and delish.
Just watched Gravity in 3D. Great film, great cinema, great sound tracks but the "experience" got ruined by people around rustling their bags of pop corn, sweets and crisps throughout the whole film. If you go to the cinema, please think of others around you and eat your food before or after the film. Use your common sense and do not ruin the film experience for others, who appreciate the art of film.
Very nice setting, amazing service, quick food, but the sauce was extremely bland for both of our dishes, sort of tasted out of the can. Bread was good though!

It all started when I bought an “Acura Certified” vehicle, which they did not bother to do the certification on. After asking about it, the used car manager (Brad Johnson) , stated “well it shouldn’t have been sold as certified”. They did do SOME of the certified things, but only what I asked about. It also turned out to be a smoker’s car, which is NOT good. They GUARANTEED that they would get rid of the smell and had it treated. After a couple treatments, it seemed better. Well, when the weather got cold and damp, I could really smell the smoke from the plastic in the vents. Now that they can’t get rid of the smell and I don’t want them to “hide” the smell for a couple weeks. They will only give me trade-in value, wow loose $12,000 in 12 months. OUCH!! Not to mention poor customer service when you bring in for repairs. I would NOT buy or bring anything to them again.!!

I bought 3 different items from this place: 1) GPS 2) PS3 3) iPhone 4 All of them are good products, but I had a hard time buying the items. It was hard to find someone to help me out, and those that "helped" me were really rude! I like their products and the best buy credit card service, but I hate the customer service! UPDATE: Buying 1 Acer Iconia and 1 external hard drive took me about 1 hour (I knew what I needed, in other words I didn't need help, I wanted to pay!), but there where only 2 workers in the computer area, one was a really nice guy, unfortunately the lady that he was helping was taking forever to make her choice. The other guy wasn't that great, I gave him the description of the external hard drive, he took about 10 mins to get it, and it was the wrong one, so when I told him that was the wrong hard drive, he tells me "I don't know what you're talking about". What kind of answer is that??? I hope this helps.

Not the best Hungry Howie's I've had. When I first moved here, it was our staple "cheap, get it & go" dinner but after several "so-so" experiences we've moved on. I know HH has great crust because I've had it before but here it always seems burnt and leaves a funky taste in my mouth.
They have little or no stock of anything but candy and plenty of hygiene products. I found the pharmacist in charge that rude, demeaning and just a mean person. I am not biased on my opinion of the store versus the pharmacy experience. I got what I came for at the store finally, but also noted they have very little stock of anything. They re a relatively new store, but really. I'd go to any Walgreens any day. The pharmacists at Wal-Mart are nicer than the one man I experienced at the pharmacy. Just plain arrogant and mean! I won't buy a shot of insulin from that place if I were dying from an overdose of sugars

This used to be a nice restaurant, but sadly its gone down fast, ordered McFlurry - got soup milk with specs in it, ordered Apple Pie, got a dihydrated apple chip.... terrible.... do not eat there unless you want to get sick

Very expensive shipping that takes a very, very long time. If you're going to make me pay for shipping, at least make sure it takes less than a month to get to me. Yeah... it took a month.Actually, the first half of the order only took a week. But, it was the wrong bulb. Not even close. Based on the other reviews though, I'm not going to attempt to return the thing. I'm sure it'll cost me more in shipping than I paid for the bulb in the first place.
Average restaurant. It's clean. Average price. Doesn't have car park for people who just come for take away. But there's space on road side.
Just at Clark's tonight for Happy Hour. We went there because they are on the water with a beautiful view. We were told by our hostess that we could not have the 1/2 price appetizers outside on the patio or anywhere else for that matter except the bar area. Matt, our wonderful server, reinforced this stupid rule. Love the atmosphere but will not be returning for Happy Hour!

The women's clothing sections were amazing, dresses, overalls, rompers, booty shorts, shrugs, micro kilts and all other style of item in one of a kind, brilliantly colored, UV-reactive patterns. Sizes fit a bit slim, so definitely try on before buying. The men's department was a little less inspiring, consisting mostly of t-shirts, albeit some interesting ones. The male employees were all very friendly and helpful. The dressing stalls are small but workable and they didn't get irritated with repeat visits like at some stores. Little expensive, but totally distinctive
It's a swap meet so don't expect much but still fun to browse and people watch.

Good lunch specials but expect rubbery cheap meat accompanied by bad music on a speaker with waaaaay too much treble. That said - I still get the lunch special once a week lately

I've been going to The Avenue at least one or two times a month for the last year. It has, without a doubt, one of the best vegan burgers in Saint Pete. The menu encourages a mix and match attitude to create your favorite burger along with providing a wide selection of "theme" burgers. Add to this the fried pickles and fried oreos, and it's a wrap. The food is just plain delicious. Unfortunately, the food is the only thing The Avenue has going for it. My first problem with The Avenue is that it doesn't seem to know what it wants to be, or rather, what it wants to be isn't what it really is. The walls are covered with big screens that run all the latest sports...but it's not really a sports bar. The walls are covered in kitschy tag sale-esque decor and raw lumber...but it's not really a neighborhood chain restaurant a la Applebees or the Outback. The bathroom door is covered in license plates and swings like an old west saloon...but it's not really a honky tonk. The logo on the wall is a clear rip-off of Jay-Z's Blueprint III album cover...but it's not really a hip-hop club. The top-shelf liquor of the bar looms like a manhatten speak easy, but it's not really a velvet rope type of establishment. On weekends there is usually an overly loud local DJ mixing the latest hip-hop and club music...while families play cornhole outside on the sidewalk. WTF is this place trying to be? Are you a burger joint or a night club? Are you a family restaurant or a party bar? Pick one. Go with it. Get good at it...stay the course. We're here for burgers and fries...not the wheels of steel at 150 decibels. The problem isn't that The Avenue offers so many options. The problem is that it doesn't do any of them well. If it picked one and went all out, I'd find that acceptable. Instead it's a mashup of "almosts" and "kind ofs" and "not quites." None of it works other than the food. It's too bad The Avenue is spending so much time focusing on the extraneous and often irritating facsimiles of style rather than making its own. My other grip with The Avenue is the serving staff. If you walk in the open doors, you'll find that all the servers are young women firmly entrenched in the current 80's nostalgia of hipster nerd culture. They're all very pretty and very nice and very willing to say hello with a smile. They're also very incompetent and more interested in dancing near the bar than actually helping customers. Not one of them has ever been able to get my order correct. I've ordered drinks that never arrived, asked for omissions from burgers due to food allergies only to have extra portions of the unwanted add-ons piled on top, and repeatedly get the veggie burger served to me rather than the 9-grain vegan burger I ordered (they offer both, which is a plus...but serve me what I order, please!). Considering that this is essentially a burger place with a straightforward menu of grilled and fried options, it's unacceptable that the serving staff can't do their jobs adequately, let alone expertly. After repeated visits, it is obvious that the servers are hired to be eye candy and not actual servers. To put it plainly, the service at The Avenue sucks. One last note. Don't ever try to use the bathroom. There is only a one-stall unisex bathroom that I have found to be covered in urine and crumpled paper towels on the two occasions I felt the urge to relieve myself. Disgusting doesn't come to explain what I found. So, my recommendation is that you try the burgers, but do so via take out/pick up. The food is good, but it's not the kind of restaurant/bar/nigh-club/theme park you want to spend too long in once you get past the ripe ol' age of 25.

I took my Lexus in for an oil change. When I went to pick it up, they gave me a $75 bill. Before you have anything done from them, be sure to ask the cost. I will not be returning.
Ordered a sandwich from here and they delivered the wrong sandwich... when I called back about it the person said that what I told her but I record all conversation on my phone and that's not what was said
The cook had a great taste. Wish they served children. And they don't even deliver to the forest.
Nice patio
This mall needs a little updating. They closed early without notice, it would have been nice for them to have a sign posted on the door that they will be closing early on New Years Eve. At any rate were able to take in about 2 to 3 stores and the sales were fairly decent. If you're already on the road traveling passed the outlet you can make it a point to stop in and take advantage of their deals. But don't make a special trip because it would be a waste of time and money with the price of gas being so high

O local é aprazível e está bem conseguido. Agora, nunca poderá ser um 5 estrelas (como ostenta à entrada) nem vale, nem pouco mais ou menos, o dinheiro. Os quartos são pequenos para um "5 estrelas", a televisão tem apenas um lote de canais mínimo com excesso de canais em língua alemã (nada contra mas esperava a disponibilidade de mais canais e a escolha é muita e variada), o serviço de bar é muito fraco e não funciona em permanência como se poderia desejar num "5 estrelas". Numa noite, um grupo de turistas que tinha chegado, cerca da meia-noite, quis utilizar o bar e foi informado que o mesmo se encontrava fechado. Em resumo, agradável mas não com tantas estrelas e nunca por este preço.

They are still going through going through some growing pains, but they are solid other than a few hiccups. I had the mushroom truffle burger which was as flavorful and mouthwatering and the smash fries...oh the rosemary garlicy goodness! Dip both the fries and shroom-truff burg in the smashsauce for a B'OMG flavor'splosion! This is my third time at this location and the cashier seemed confused with the order process, yet again, but recovered and per the usual the busers I interacted with were nice and genuinely seemed to happy to be there, which makes my restaurant experience enjoyable. I will continue coming back as the meat is always fresh tasting and I cannot get enough of the fries!
months after this Walmart opened my hair dresser moved to this store so I transferred my Prescriptions and started using this store as my One stop store and dearly loved it.. The last 2-3 times I have been there ALL OF Their Motorized Baskets Have been broken and out of Operation.... Due to a stroke I am unable to Drive, or can not walk very far and have to depend on my daughter to drive me and again today she had to take my list while I sat up front and waited for her. I want to continue to use this store.....But may have to Take all my business elsewhere....perhaps Market Street up the road....From 40 years shopping with United/ Market Street in the Lubbock Area they always have Motorized Baskets Working And available for their Customers

All the staff are generally very courteous. If you ask where something is they'll stop what they're doing to come and help you find it. However Walmart Inc. is tooo concerned about profit thus the store is WAY understaffed. You can walk around for a long time sometimes before you find someone to help you.
I am not a person who writes review even though service was bad. This service is terrible... I gave him living social coupon for Big Mac and Laege Fries for free, but he didn't accept it because IT DOES NOT SAY FREE on coupon. Plus, he gave me only small amount of fries (see the picture!!) and fries were spead out everywhere... my god, I cannot believe this...

De bediening is daar vriendelijk maar wel wat aan de trage kant. De stacaravan was mooi opgepoetst als we aankwamen. Rustige en mooie ligging. Wel een GROOT minpunt zijn de activiteiten! Alles staat in de folder maar is ofwel nog in opbouw (bv. disco) ofwel is het te klein (bv. waterfietsen). Ook na 9uur kun je geen snackje meer gaan eten want de snackbar en het restaurant sluiten om 9uur. Best wel oké dus als je tot rust wil komen, niet zo geschikt voor kinderen (wel kwa vriendelijkheid endergelijke maar er is buiten zwemmen, strand en minigolven niet veel te doen).
Very expensive... Food not good. Chicken Chesapeake... Chicken was overcooked and tough... Crab was basically just sauce very little crab.

While the folks are nice and inform you of what is to take place with your computer, all is not completely delivered. I, too, wanted to patronize a local business. The price was nearly double than the Geek Squad, and I pointed this out. I was told that they charge higher rates because they add useful software. Considering this was a laptop that I was going to sell, I trusted that they would do a complete re-set and add the software as promised. When I turned it on, I believe the reset occurred, but no added software. Disappointed that I was charged more and received basically the same service as Geek Squad. I won't be returning.

It really depends what time you go to the restaurant! The Food and Sweet Tea are both really good. but the workers are so immature and RUDE they talk on the cell phone and walk away in the middle of the order if you go to the drive thru. and then half the order is wrong. If they had half descent people working there! it would be a great place to eat! although they do need to do something about the air in the resurant it is very HOT if you stay to eat there.

I get waxed regularly and this year I decided to try a few different places to compares services. The woman was running late which is absolutely acceptable if you inform the customer rather than them sat there wondering when they are going to be seen. On inspection at home I can visibly see patches that have been missed. I paid for a full leg and hollywood, given that there is not much hair on the bottom of my legs I did not expect her to take long, and assumed she would be thorough in other places. This was not the case, I am left a little disappointed. If you ask for it all off it means you want to be left completely bare, I wont be revisiting here for a wax.
Not a bad place. Be sure to be clear with the person putting together the initial work order. They seem to have issues communicating to the technicians. This can lead to long delays, so be sure to call back and inquire about your machine.

The only real option for Italian food in the McCalla area. Overall the good is good but the service is severely lacking. The fresh baked table bread is excellent as is the marinara sauce. The meatballs are pretty bland - little more than balled up hamburger. Entrees are for the most part quite good and are a good value for the price.

I bought a used car that had significant damage undisclosed to me and Carfax. I thought I could trust a dealer and had no one in town who knew something about cars to help out. When I realized the shape the car was in I tried to get a refund two weeks later. Mr. Carr agreed to fix it, but the AC still did not work among other initial issues. Good service, but I would not recommend buying anything other than certified or new if you must shop here.

Went for fire and ice last Christmas. Left after I ordered a $9 coffee drink and was given a shot of booze and told to mix it with the fill you own coffee in the other end of the building
Good experience, but lacking in price catagory. They are as strict on pricing as the Austrians making the darn things. They need to lighten up a little. And all the hype to give them "all 5's" for their ratings is a huge turn off. I am a Quality Manager for an aerospace company and if I asked my customers for "all 5's" they would laugh at me as anyone remotely familiar with a continual improvement program knows that a true measure of quality comes from honest feedback.

Great bar, friendly staff. There food is consistently inconsistent. Too many times have I ordered a $23 entree and have it come out horribly prepared. Stick to the bar, and order salads, burgers and cheese fondue!

Saw this on Sydney Weekender and thought it would be a nice place for my Wife and I to enjoy a Sunday lunch. When we arrived for our midday booking, we were eventually shown to our table where we sat for 25 minutes before getting a drink. After another 20 minutes I asked the service staff, who were very pleasant, to take our order. She did so, but informed us the kitchen was not taking orders at the moment, so there would be a delay. Incredible considering I had booked a table for midday and it was not about 1;10pm. So we sat and go our entree in about another 30 minutes. This was average at best. nearly an hour later we recieved one main course, with the service staff apologizing that the other main would follow soon... 10 minutes later. During the course of the afternoon, we listened to the staff aplogise to everyone in the room about the delays. It seemed to me the kitchen was not organised, and the delays spoilt what promised to be a nice afternoon. We left at 330pm (3 1/12 hours for lunch) Might one day give them another chance, but they need to work harder in the kitchen if they want to charge the prices they ask. PS: other tables around us also commented to us their disappointment in the time frame... no fault of the service staff, by the way.

I ordered online and had waited about an hour wondering where my pizza was. Then I checked my email which told me "Your pizza will be at your house in 120-130min". There is no reason it should take 2 hours to recieve a pizza after ordering it. Then when I called to ask what the long wait was for, I got nothing but snobby remarks and I was hung up on. Be careful with this one. The food was tasty but my pizza was practically cold when it got to my house.
Knowledgable staff, not complaints with how they treat their animals and the Vet seems to know his stuff no problem. But a few of the staff have personalities that I find a bit stand offish, including the Vet, he's a nice guy but he's in and out and doesn't explain that much. I've tried to get them to explain to me multiple times how many shots my kittens need or how many they have had and what not. No matter how many times I ask I keep getting confused and they run in circles and don't fully answer me. I know it's not their intent to be confusing but it's frustrating. The first time I took my kittens in I tried to get the Vet to explain how many shots and the prices and what they needed I I kind of got brushed off as he gave my kittens their shots without fully explaining what the shots were. NOT OK. I understand it is a busy clinic but everytime I call them they are putting me on hold 3 or more times. It's not completely their fault as people in the clinic should honestly be letting them finish on the phone first but its very annoying. Hold once is fine until you are done with customers but when you pick the phone back up please focus on me. I find this odd as every time I've been in there has inly been 1 other customer in the waiting room every time. They gave me photocopies of their records which I cannot understand very well at all. I have two kittens, same age and siblings, and one record is missing a bunch of stuff but because they come during the same appointment they only filled out one completely, which I find sad as I like having proper records at home. I probably will be moving Vets after my kittens are done all their 1st year shots and boosters. In summary there's nothing wrong with their knowledge or treatment of the animals, but I'd like to be somewhere that is also focused on the pet's owner understanding what's going on.
Do not allow them to pull your credit under the promise that "it's just a soft pull and won't do anything to your credit". Within 48 hours my husband had 6 hard pulls on his credit and I had 4- all stemming from Morrie's. When we asked them about this, we were told that they would fall off of our credit score as soon as our loan (from our Credit Union- not even through them) was closed. They still haven't 3 weeks later. We were also sold a car that had mismatched license plates on it.

Just returned from a lovely trip to Sharm, the weather is perfect in November. Hotel staff were friendly, food is good for an all-inclusive, and the reef area that the hotel provide free access to (10 minutes by bus) is both lovely and amazing. Why not five stars? - we had brown water (in small quantities) for three days, had to wash using outside showers - the room was a 10 minute walk from reception, above a shopping area with the room beneath ours still being built, though this was only noisy for on one morning of our stay. - the hotel has rats, despite its many (many) cats - real fruit juice was prohibitively expensive, despite many local sellers trading pomegranates and mangoes... a shame. - on leaving they made two mistakes with the bill, and tried to fob me off into paying it... not pleasant. The person manning reception appeared over worked.
Been here for 1 1/2 yrs and the apt is of good quality for the price point. My upstairs neighbors are making my life a pain but such is apt living. I have registered a complaint and suggestion to the office so we will see. Overall, feels safe and like home where I am.

Pour une brasserie, le midi, c'est très cher. Le service n'est pas très rapide et la qualité est correcte, mais sans plus. Le soir, pour venir boire un coup, le barman est franchement désagréable, impossible d'avoir des amuses gueules végétariennes, il n'y a que l'assiette de charcuterie à 15€. On a franchement l'impression de déranger.

Another review echoing tales of their poor customer service; the people who work at this store just aren't good people. I was shopping for shoes with my husband while nine months pregnant; the baby had dropped and everything. Naturally, I had to pee while I was there. I asked the cashier if I could use their bathroom, and he said no! He wasn't apologetic about it either; he actually rolled his eyes when I explained that I'm nine months pregnant and needing to pee causes a lot of pain. If you have ever experienced life with someone's head crushing your bladder you know how evil that man is!!! I wanted to walk out right then but the (lazy) salesgirl had just come back with my husband's shoes, which he needed for a wedding the next day, and they were 25% off, so they got the sale - but we are NEVER EVER EVER EVER going back there.

A olympic size swimming pool. It can be quite crowded during summer days, where everyone wants a cool dip. Try to avoid peak hours.
Joe's Farm Grill has good food, a relaxing "down-to-earth" home-style atmosphere. If you have a large family, prepare to spend big bucks! Never seems to have any group or family deals. Like the idea of supporting local farms and small business, but this is definitely more of a trendy fast food/diner style restaurant. If you consider yourself a HIPSTER, then you will fit right in at this place.

We went there with my son and our neighbor's daughters... ON A FRIDAY NIGHT!!! Nevertheless, it wasn't bad. Our service was ok with the capacity of patrons, and the children had good access to the games and play area. My only item would be the bathrooms. Clean them often, or have a guy monitoring because it was a pig sty there... Other than that, an alright experience.
The food & service is pretty good here.

Parking for three cars or more is a no go. We've tried for years to change it, actually the whole residents tried to make the change but unsuccessful. Guest parking is very limited.
Think of a cleaner version of Cici's Pizza with less chance of digestive distress and you'll be thinking of Talliano's. The employees are polite, clean, and take requests for the buffet. It's not the best pizza, but it's still pretty decent and there's a lot of it.

You need to bring the mussel with cheese back.
This was possibly the worst service I've ever had. I've been here twice and won't be back fr a third go. Tonight we waited 20 minutes for drinks, except our one beer, which after waiting 30+ minutes I went to the bar to get. AFTER I got the beer the bartender took our order. I believe we waited 45 more minutes for the manager to came ask if we had ordered yet and another 15-20 for the food. After that, when the food eventually came out, my boyfriend asked for more chili for his hot dog - there was maybe a table spoon of chili on it - after the rest of us finished eating he eventually got up,went to the window and got it himself.
Chinese takeout...decent prices and bog portions..
Nice breakfast place. Enjoyed the meal. Good service.
Fun place bring kids here for food n games
Really annoying experience there which means I will never go back. Took a friend for pizza during their happy hour. The pizza is pretty good but is also fairly overpriced. We didn't have long left before the happy hour closed but we were in time. I asked the lady behind the bar to be sure but after she had taken my money and gone to the till her boss told her she had to charge full price even though we were in time. To be honest, I wouldn't have minded paying more but you can't change the rules of a happy hour to suit your own greed. If you want people to order half an hour earlier - close the happy hour half an hour earlier. For me, food and decor matter little but good service is key and I will never go back. The Camel around the corner does great pies, with a good selection of board games and a really nice atmosphere - as well as really nice staff. I will always go there instead.
Every year we go to Branson and make it a point to eat at Mr. G's. The pizza and crab rolls have always been tremendous, but it has been my last experience that compelled me to write. Our party of 6 came in at about an hour before closing. We had a nice waitress, and honestly, she just wasn't having a good day with orders not quite right, tickets not seperated, etc. Her demeanor was still good, and we were on vacation, so no biggie. It turns out we were there well after close because of the mistakes and miscues. We were all trying to make the best of it, and none of us complained, but when someone came out to take our plates, my dad made a comment about how awesome the food still was, and the person (not our waitress) did not so much as raise his had to acknowledge he was being spoken to! He completely ignored him! I'm hoping someone at Mr. G's reads this, because it kind of irritated my dad. He will be bringing another 12-14 couples back to Branson in February, and I don't think they will be making the trip to Mr. G's. We love the food, but customer service is high on his list, even when things aren't going the way they should.

Great view but the food was subpar. Just like every other review.
Some quality things, but you must search through lots of junk. Employees appeared lazy.
With Bangkok's nightlife very fickle and new clubs opening and old ones shutting done, Bed SupperClub can always be relied upon to provide a good night out, as long as you go on Model night or the weekend. It attracts a fairly mixed crowd from local expats, to tourists wanting to tick it off the list. If you're after clubs in a similar vein but with a more local feel, check out clubs Ekkamai and Thong Lo where the so called "Hi-So" go.
Ate a good pub meal, it was very quiete in there, around 1800 hours friday. What i would expect from a good pub. Certainly not a resturant, very good prices for a meal after work.

This is our weekly pub. Every Sunday night, for years, our local gang of geek friends meets up here. Did you know Grendel's won a Supreme Court case? Did you know the letters in their name rearrange to form the words "Nerd Legends"? The beer is good, and the food is certainly a good deal when half-priced. My recommendation is the Natural Disaster burger with a veggie patty -- what I get every time I go!

I have purchased many $$$$ from this store and am treated with indifference every time. Recently I went to return a ball of yarn (for credit mind you) and was informed I was 2 days over the 30 day return policy! Every other yarn shop I know of, and I've been to many across North America, have at least a 90 day return policy. What happened to the days where ylys would put yarn on the back shelf for you til you had the money to come & pick it up? Also, any other store you buy something you can return it for your money back. Why do yarn shops get away with only giving a credit? Anyway...I had a credit at For Yarns Sake and decided to use it to get some yarn to make a sweater for my only granddaughter's tenth birthday. I came across the pattern afew years ago & was really excited to knit it. I purchased Rowan Cashsoft DK in 3 colors with purple being the main color. There have been so many slubs in the purple yarn that I am having to cut them out every few rows! I have so many knots & tie ends it embarrsses me to give as a gift. Not only that, but because I lost so much yardage with cutting all the slubs out, I ended up having to buy another ball! The shop owner didn't offer a discount or a "gee, I'm sorry". She did say she was going to send the rest of hers back of which I assume she will get reimbursed for. We knitters in the Portland Metro area are very fortunate to have many great yarn shops to choose from and I choose in the future to not shop at For Yarns Sake.

The Buca di Beppo in Tallahassee is much smaller than locations that I've visited in other cities. While the food is usually an excellent mix of savory, Italian classics, the service at this location has been hit-or-miss. The first time I went, the service was excellent. The last time I went, I was overcharged and the server didn't kept delivering the wrong items to people in our group. When I brought up the situation to the server, I was told that the menu price must be wrong despite what it stated. The manager didn't really help out on this issue, either. Overall, its a fair experience if you have a large group of people to feed, but pay close attention to your receipt.
I really and truly enjoyed my trip tp Paradeep and Bhitarkanika National Reserve Forest. It was a delightful experience to be sailing in the Brahmani river in a bhotbhoti! I agree that i have been to Sundarbans a number of years ago by a launch and i actually night-stayed in the launch but sailing is always a delightful experience, be it for one hour or e few days... We had been a little wrong in selecting the time for our trip but we could not go there before the Holi as my ICSE examinations were going on before that. By the time we were at Paradeep it was quite hot and we unfortunately could not see much of the famous white crocodile of Bhitarkanika. we did see few saltwater crocodiles as well as spotted deer (cheetal) and a few harmless wild animals. The thing we saw the most were the stilt roots and breathing roots of the mangrove trees. There is a very interesting crocodile museum where there are skeletons and skulls of crocodiles as huge as 18 feet in length. Moreover, there were preserved eggs of crocodiles, of Olive Ridley turtles (which are rarely seen as they are endangered species) and many other marine animal species (snakes like cobra included). The journey as well as the scenic beauty quite enchanted me. As a nature lover, I would surely request every other nature lover to pay a visit to this reserved forest. I cannot of course guarantee full satisfaction but I assure you that this place is ideal for a short break from our monotonous day to day routine. And do not please forget Paradeep - it has a beautiful beach, a grand port and lighthouse, an amazing aquarium (the place i liked the most) and the mohona (meeting) of Mahanadi with the Bay of Bengal which mesmerized me...

SKIP THIS COURSE on your next golf outing. Arrived 45 minutes early for our tee time to a understaffed course. Then were treated to the most rude starter I've ever came across. Followed that up by a 3 hour, 45 minute FRONT NINE! We were then accused of being the 3 groups slowing up play even though we waited 15 minutes on each shot. Told the ranger we were quitting and he said, "good". Completely rude & unprofessional staff. Other than that, Jackie Jr. put a nice course out there that I am sure won't be around very much longer if they keep up their policies of rude and incompetent staff.

The service has been terrible the last few months. On several occasions a group of us sat for a long time without anyone greeting us. I was there a few weeks ago for lunch and our server didn't smile and had an attitude throughout our meal and was rude. Just last week we were there for some drinks and appetizers and same thing, server took far to long to greet us and then proceeded to be unfriendly and rude, we ended up just getting a drink and leaving because of how terrible the service was.

Yeh, it has got a nice vibe - very laid back staff in a community setting of an ex-squat now serving as a community centre with music and dance classes and rehearsals available - Good for a visit to see as about bohemian as Copenhagen gets...nice range of beers and they do an evening meal (on the night I visited, a hearty stew) for around 6,5 krr. They have regular events which looked of varying quality but I was sad to see my stay precluded me from the Django Reinhardt eve which I imagine on a cold wet night could be cosy. There is a piano there.

Pushy salesman tactics and aggressive sales manager. Tried to push us into a car that wasn't either the color and features we wanted just so they could make a sale. Will not be going back.
This place is located in downtown Apache Junction. It is a golf themed restaurant, near a golf course. It is in an old building but the breakfast food is good at a good price and great service. It is American style food. It is a fun alternative to Denny's for breakfast. I felt like I was eating at a vintage restaurant in Globe, AZ.
By far the worst room we have ever lived in. Mould on the walls, wall paper full of watery stains and discoloration, and losing contact with the wall. Freezing cold tiny room and non-working radiator, constant cold draft through big window, the bathroom is so small that you have to sit sideways on the toilet. Ceiling height was about 195 cm. Location, facilities and service is OK, but in its current condition, it is NOT worthy of accommodation.

My order wasn't the problem. The problem was that when I pulled up to the window and after the window lady handed me my drink I overheard (and watched) her ask "What is wrong with the machine?" It was apparent that the soda mchine had acted on it's own and started randomly pouring drinks, to which the drive thru attendant put cups down for. -No problem right?- WRONG. The manager proceeds to grab each drink, pour them out and then re-stack them in the cups that are to be served in the future. I was not only so mad to call them to try to get the manager's name (with little avail because the line is currently busy), but am also disgusted with the service they are going to provide future customers. -Mike

Had Sunday lunch which was £15 a head. I thought this was quite expensive for Sunday Lunch but was happy to pay it because of the good reviews the pub had. when the food arrived it was stone cold. When we told the waitress she pulled a face and looked at us like we were mad. She took the food away without an apology or explanation. Waited ages for our replacements and when they finally came I was given lamb instead of beef. I informed the waitress but said I would eat it anyway but wanted a refund for the price difference. I never got it and couldn’t be bothered making a fuss over £2. The food is left on the pass for collection with all the empty glasses and ignored by the waitresses who both looked like they really didn’t want to be at work. The tables were very dirty and weren’t cleaned the whole time we were there. To be fair the food was very nice but totally spoiled by the service and grubby surroundings. Won’t be going back for seconds.
Very fast, generous portions but lots of fried and processed food. Nothing special, just your basic take it out of a box and fry it menu. Waitress was nice but scattered, bringing us another table's order. The fresh mushrooms on my salad weren't cleaned (looked like they came straight out of the carton).

When it's good, it's good; but the problem is trying to figure out when it will be good. Sometimes, an order will be very fresh and warm and simply delicious. There are also other times in which the food is either undercooked or burnt and tough. The service tends to be pretty good, but it has its own bad days too.

Have been on work for 4 weeks and booked an extended stay. The only reason is I get paid a very low per diem and this was the only hotel in my budget in the downtown area - about 10 mins walk from the Financial District where I needed to commute for work. For the price, I would give it 3.5 stars of 5. As others have pointed out, majority of the staff is polite and helpful. One can forgive the odd one - and I can say this because I stayed here for 4 weeks. The room is extremely small and crampy, old beds, worn out bedspreads and bedsheets, but clean nonetheless. They do your bed on a daily basis, and entertain most requests. I needed a hot-plate and a microwave since I am very picky about food and prefer to cook - they had no issues at all providing me with that. Internet sucks, video streaming is blocked, pretty slow - but for $5 for the entire stay - it's manageable if all you do is reply to e-mails and do random browsing. Overall - decent place. I would have preferred a bigger room for a little more - but they don't have that option. If you are in the downtown area, and need a place to stay for a couple of days, this is definitely doable. Worth considering on a tight budget, and other hotels in the downtown area will not even entertain the request for a hot plate.

Serviced our Mercedes sprinter van 3 times now. Still going back for more. They supplied us a nice loaner car for the time our vehicle was in service. I have had 2 negative experiences however. 1 was a giant scratch and dent I had to point out to them. ( kinda hard to believe they did not inform me about it. ) 2nd was 2 front grill bolts were completely left loose which i noticed upon pickup. They started the threads by hand and never finished tightening. 1 more negative experience will send me elsewhere. Stay tuned. 12/7/12. Im headed back today to get a brake service.
Good food; below-average service. Our server seemed to think there were two on our table. When we were a party of three. She did have great sales skills - getting me into buying a bottle of wine. Overall, I had a good time.
This place is closed until further notice due to issues with licenses.
We were informed by staff that Jimmy's Grill has a new owner as of 10/1/13 - the owner of Potters Place (also downtown Naperville). Staff was being measured for new uniforms and when we inquired about the new uniforms we were informed of the ownership change. Unaware of any immediate changes to the name / menu / staff, etc.
The food is great. Just watch the price. They tend to under-charge, over-charge, or double charge at this location. The price is inconsistent when I get roughly the same weight every day. I don't know if it is intentional or just lack of training or attention. Just watch it, or try another Lee's Deli location. There is one two blocks over and one block down toward market.
Depends what you're doing there... :-)
Chang's chicken (dry) was really good. Some dishes have a lot of garlic added so ask before ordering and you will enjoy the food.

If you want a three-course meal, don't expect to come out of it without spending nearly $100. The food is fresh and the service is great.
Prices are ridiculously high for the simple menu items. 1/2 sandwich, 8 chips & drink is over $10. All gimmick, best skip.
Grt place for trekking , u won't any shops for miles . No water bodies are Thr except a dirty little spring . In rainy reason the place has a totally different look said the locals .
Food is good but we have ordered food to-go twice and it takes FOREVER. You could go inside, sit down, and eat faster than getting your food to-go. Ridiculous.
Convenient for many Dutch people .Hassle free and efficient. Pity about the long walk to the cheap parking.

No place to sit! Too sweet. Too expensive. Don't know if they were remodeling but no chairs in the place. Sweetness is relative, I know. And we all know we can snag a gallon of premium ice cream at the supermarket for the $6 we pay for a cup here.

In a 40 hour period comprising only one night in their hotel and only 7 hours in the room. With all the rest of my time on the floor gambling and they want to charge $11.00 per day for internet access. How low rent transparent can you get? The floor personel were fine..but whoever made that idiotic rule lost a customer. I don't believe having internet access is the deciding factor on whether I go to the floor to gamble. 4G is limited but available so their pathetic attempt at cost savings or manipulation is a mute point..but they did accomplish running me off to a casino that understands hospitality and amenities. Thanks Harrahs..your a class act.
Did not like the breakfast menu but i stayed at the penthouse which was great !!!
We were at this Applebee's today and everything was fine until I found a folded piece of paper in my Oriental Chicken Salad. When I brought the server over she was very apologetic, brought the manager over who said they would comp me my salad and give me another one. I said thank you and asked that since some time had passed that they please bring me the salad in a to-go container because we had to leave. I checked the salad when I got home and they didn't give me any dressing for the salad! So now I have a dry salad. I called them and they said I could come and get some dressing, but the restaurant is out of my way, so I declined. They did offer to send out some coupons as an apology, but I'm a little tired of the apologies piling up on one another. We went there because my mother-in-law had a gift card. But I doubt I'll go there again.
Overrated place. Service was not good. Reservation handling was even worse. Initially reserved place for 6, after that (within 20 minutes) called again to add two more people and re-confirm the reservation for 8. After being assured that this is not a problem, the table was so small that even 6 people had difficulty placing their plates on the table at the same time. Good thing this never happened as many of the dishes were late.. bear this in mind when visiting. Other than that, atmosphere and most importantly food was good! Although for same prices, I could recommend numerous places with better food.
Atmosphere is quaint and unique, the food is pretty good, and they have a great selection of teas. It's nothing spectacular, but worth trying out. It's certainly more notable for tea and baked goods than it is for "real" food, but that's not bad either. Prices aren't bad either.
This is the only dive shop in the immediate area. It holds a decent amount of scuba gear. As a PFI trained freediver and serious underwater photographer this shop continually lets me down on inventory that is of use to me. I also get the impression by the attitudes of the employees that I am "less than" a diver because I choose to explore on a breath hold

This use to be my favorite place to go. I have been here maybe 10 times in the past. It has been great experiences with food, great wait staff and always the bartender is fun. This has all since changed. I took a friend from out of town here as we drove all the way from Mt. Evans just to get a beer and enjoy the wings. BAD CHOICE... We put our name on the list even though there were many open tables. We sat and sat and sat and finally after 1hour of waiting I go back and ask whats up they fumble through the written down names and realize oh they forgot us. Were so sorry.. LOL.. nice I kindly obliged and said I'd rather drive another 30 minutes to boulder where we will not be forgotten. Last week I decided to give this place another try, because after 10 good experiences I said this had to be a bad day for them. Boy was I wrong. The management is atrocious. Same story... I get there and again confronted with a bumbling lady stating there is a wait. I laughed and said I know this story... I can clearly see there is open tables inside and out. Why can't we be seated? She replies oh those tables are for waiters that are not here yet.. (so you don't seat the people waiting because you don't have enough waiters?) Maybe hire more?? Just saying.... So stated my story that last time you forgot us after over an hour, we will be at the bar. I get a beer and wait and wait... Finally they come up an seat us next to the bathroom in a little 2 seater table, with about 8 other nicer tables and some outside. I laughed and said you have to be kidding?? They did finally get us a table near the bar area. We sat and waited for our waitress who comes up takes our drink order and then runs off not to be seen for a long time. Finally she brings drinks and before we could put an order in she runs off again. Pretty frustrated at this point we flag her down and say can we get some food here? To their credit the food is still decent. We ordered the wings and sweet potato fries, and laughed as we said we better count and see if they go everything here. Of course we were short a wing, though we never got the chance to point it out, because we never saw our waitress again. They have really gone down hill and hopefully the owner reads these reviews and starts by hiring a manager for the place. The service is downright horrible.. I will never return to this place. Stay home buy a smoker and make your own wings and avoid this place...

Little place hidden in Chinatown which was delicious. I recommend the Spicy Thai Fried Rice.
Worst Chinese food in Angelo.
Really nothing more than a mill. The optometrist was a nice but clearly overworked. No reason why I showed up 15 minutes prior to my appt but still had to wait 30 minutes after my appt time to be seen. Its now been 5 weeks since my appt and no glasses. No follow up, nothing. Really bad customer service. Stick to Costco or Lens Crafters I am editing my review and raising it from 1 star to 3 stars. The sole reason I am editing this review and increasing the star rating is because of the manager, Rose. She is professional, courteous, and handled my problem right away with various options and solutions.

Honestly the worst omelette ever served to me. I waited 25 minutes to pay $12 for the most awful food. A simple sausage and cheese omelette came out as egg beaters and dinner sausage with whatever cheese was left over. Just awful.

Customer service is The Absolute worst I've seen. Tried callin in the order but the phone people seemed SO annoyed that I was calling them for an order I hung up. I went in to order for pick up, then ran a couple errands and was 5 mins past the time they said it would be ready When I went in to pick up. The woman manager (never got her name) Ignored me for 10 min while I was standing RIGHT in front of her. When I nearly Yelled at her to check my order because I was not going to stand there any longer waiting on her when I am the customer. "CHECK TO SEE IF MY FRIGGIN PIZZA IS DONE! NOW!!!" she looked down checked the ticket and Shoved the pizza across the counter at me. and VERY Sarcastically said "there ya go!"..... Ridiculous! What ever happened to customer service? Why Cant people just be nice and do their friggin JOB!?!? Geeeesh!
So disappointed, used to go when they were on Main Street, now that they moved and it seems much smaller... it wasn't big to begin with! We went on Saturday which is typically very busy, we waited about 10 minutes while the host ran around saying she would be right with us, she took our name and said she would get back to us... at least 4 to 5 parties left because the wait was 45 to an hour! 10 minutes later she said it would be another 30 minutes! 50 minutes are you kidding me; I have never waited even on a Saturday to eat here! She also was telling people that the kitchen was backed up and that it might be a while till you got served! WOW I am going to miss those Potato Chips!!

Not a bad place, very average and adequate. The iron didn't work and they replaced it quickly. Railing for towels in bathroom fell but otherwise no complaints. Room was clean and a/c worked fine.
Food is not good as it costs..n service is also expensive becoz of only hotel in city with good standard..
I have been here a few time because its close to my home. I keep giving this location chance after chance and they let me down everytime. I ordered 2 meat pzolos and got 2 philly cheesestake pzolos and this isnt the 1st they got my order wrong. They take too long, I wait forever for someone to take my order, and the food is always average at best. this the last time im going there.

Lots of variety, handy having the convenience store right there. Usually eat by drop-in, but order from elsewhere for delivery.
Suggested by Atlanta Eats......Food was good, not the big hype I thought it would be. Now the customer service was awesome! I'll go back and try something other than the grouper sandwich and maybe the hype will show its face.

Nice location, average food. We were not very impressed. I understand the food would be a bit more expensive given it is by the beach, but I imagined it would be on par with the V&A. However, the food was dry and not very tasty. Harbour House in V&A is much better.

These places are donation based nonprofits. Goodwill in Oregon has stepped up their game in the last decade. This is due in large part due to the more retail business approach started by the head of Oregon Goodwill who felt people would like to have at least a clean, well lit, and semi organized experience. (a huge change from what it was a decade ago or is found in other states) Oregon Goodwill is massively successful as a result! other states are now following the model set by Oregon. the guy earned his pay, taking a company that was limping along to a whole new level. To clear up some posts GOODWILL IS A NON PROFIT (look up their business licence in oregon) Thats why donations are tax deductible.) most hospitals are too as well as some insurance companies like statefarm. This ONLY means that people get paid a fair market wage (determined by the state) and there are no share holders that receive any profits. Dont confuse this with free.

I must admit I am not one for quick food that tastes the same in all outlets but if you want somthing very quick its not bad. But if you want a great tasting coffee is the best place great coffee and very cheap
Waitress kept trying to sell us stupid stuff. The wings are horrible tough and flavorless. Drink prices are out rageouse. Then to top it off the tried to scam me on my tip. Bartender tried to sneek a 1 infront of my 3.00 tip. NEVER AGAIN!!!
The food was ok but we all left feeling bloated, sick, tired and extremelly thirsty. Maybe they are using too much MSG but it wasn't a great way to feel at the end of a meal.

I was at Hollywood 20 today, January 17th, to see the new Movie Zero Dark 30 at 12:10. Upon leaving the theater a little after 3 pm I was charged $3.00 for parking. There are signs everywhere that parking is free for movie goers but the boy in the booth refused my validated ticket and would not even look at me. I immediately called the manager of the theater who responded, "Are they doing that again?" This is the second time this has happened to me. The first time I can excuse as maybe a bad employee but the second? With a manager who doesn't even seem to care I have no choice but to go out of my way to avoid Hollywood 20 in Sarasota until something is done.
It closes at 7pm. Please fix drove here at 8pm it was closed.
Very few choices of idlys... More choices in dosai.. Decent enough for the price.. Tiffin and soft drink for two costs around 170 INR...
Low end hotel. cheap and not too clean.

Run away. The Pizza is terrible. I mean nasty. The worst I've ever had anywhere, including grocery store, carnival, buffet, etc. I had to check decor and service to publish this review, but I've never been to the store: so ignore those ratings. If the Pizza stinks, who cares about the Decor or service anyway.
Joseph Hernandez was my dealer and he was very down-to-earth and easy to talk to. There was definitely lack of communication on warranty price, however. And this large increase in my price was not brought to my attention until I met with the financer (don't know his name). I felt that this was an attempt to sneak in a higher price. Not right. I still went on with the purchase and am happy with my car, but I would not recommend this dealership to anyone else because of this low move on their part. Buying a car is a big deal, Mike Erdman Nissan--try to make it a good experience for the customer. I hate that I'm not completely happy with this experience.

So we showed up on a rainy night wearing flip flops and rain coats as one might when they didn't want to ruin their clothes. The bouncer successfully extorted $10 from me because I wanted to get in but was not willing to wear leather shots that would be ruined on the rain. Then because we weren't going to spend the table fee of $150 to sit at a patio table we were relegated to the back. Moving along...this must have been the only hookah bar I've ever been to that didn't serve tea. The shisha was great to be fair. The music, horrendously repetitive house.

We've been to Gordy's several times now, but I've been noticing the quality of the food seems to be going down a bit each time. Maybe its because we ordered take-out the last couple times, I don't know. But especially with the dumplings, I think I got better tasting ones at Grocery Outlet for less than half of what Gordy's charges for just seven! PLUS they raised their prices in January, so now it's even more expensive, while the quality has not improved. Further, they haven't even updated their menu online to reflect the new prices, so when I last called in, my bill was about $20 higher than I had calculated from their website! This place was great the first couple times I went, but now it's just okay. I hope they can figure things out, because it would be sad to stop going there anymore!

If you want comfort food, this is the place, so please don't expect 5 star cuisine. The restaurant is clean. The waitresses are polite but distant. We like to go there for a hearty breakfast which is definitely a cut above Denny's and IHOP and such places. My husband loves eating there!
Service is quite good. They're willing to assist you, especially with directions. Prepare to have roommates though, 8 beds per room with 1 shower, 1 toilet and two sinks.

I haven't been back there in years, even though I drive past it daily. Here's one example why I avoid it: soggy nachos. The nachos were so bad, they were virtually inedible. There are much better Mexican restaurants nearby.
I do have to say that this hotel is incredibly beautiful, but the number of problems I encountered on my recent trip was unreal. Upon arriving I was in awe with the resort. As far as aesthetics go, this place has it all. My problem is with the lack of customer service. The night my boyfriend and I arrived, the two downstairs restaurants were "booked" we thought this was strange since there were servers standing around and a lot of empty tables. We learned from server that the restaurants had actually run out of food. We decided to eat at the lobby bar which is spacious and inviting. There were kids everywhere, which felt a little strange for a bar scene, but was only slightly aggravating. Our server took my boyfriends card at the beginning of the meal, which was fine, except that when she brought us the check to sign at the end of the meal, she didn't bring the card back. We gave her our room number so that we could receive our complimentary drinks, and took them with us while we explored the hotel. The next morning at bunch (we ate brunch in the spa. both meals were very good.) we noticed that we did not have our card. After running from the front desk to the bar a dozen times, our server from the night before got in touch with someone who explained that they cut up the card. Apparently, Marriott's policy is to call the bank, and it is our banks policy to cancel a card if it is reported in someone else's hands. I was furious. I felt as though our server, Elle, could have found our room number in her computer or the manager could hold the card in a safe for a day or two. I talked to a manager, Amy, who confirmed that the card was cut up. She offered to buy us drinks, which didn't soothe me. After a few minutes of thinking about it, I told a man at the front desk to let Amy know that I wanted a complimentary night. She never called. Over 12 hours later, I left her another message. She called early the next morning. Shortly after she called, a man knocked on our door and asked to look at our phones. We were still in bed. I found this to be very unprofessional and very rude. I went to see Amy shortly after this. She informed me that she believed that because I was staying under a discounted rate, that I was already receiving a considerable discount. I explained to her that I had been staying at Marriott's for years and that I did not expect less from Marriott as a company because I had a friend who works for Marriott that offered me a lower rate. Amy credited me $100 which was enough to allow me to feel some justice, although I am still irritated. Other discrepancies include dirty wine glasses, uninformed employees, and a lack of customer service. I had to argue with ten people to find out where our credit card was and argue with several more before anyone stopped to listen. It was a disappointing experience.

Good, but expensive and not much selection...
Out of all my frequent visits to this Zara location, most have been met at quite unpleasant terms. Majority of the staff is quite. . . unkind. Well, thats one way to put it. Not what I would call polite, nor helpful, but not fully rude. The place is a little too dark for my liking, and the men's section could be a tad extended. Overall, OK; however, I don't intend to go back anytime soon.

Two and a half stars would be more accurate, but I'll give Brasa the benefit of the doubt this time. We reserved a table (highly recommended) and were seated promptly upon our arrival. We were seated at a table that had crumbs on it from the previous patrons, but no big deal, swept them off and let it go. The Brasa Experience was explained to us by our waiter, we got our wine and we headed off to check out the buffet items. The salad bar/buffet was mediocre at best. The quality was not any better than what you might find at your local chain restaurant and therefore does not justify the price you pay for eating here. The meat, by contrast, was excellent, except for one piece of sirloin that was tough. However, of the 14 advertised items, only 9 were offered to us in the course of the evening (we were at our table for an hour and forty minutes). I enjoyed the lamb, but this was only offered once. More frequent visits by the servers would have been appreciated. Only one server had the wherewithal to ask if the dining patrons would like meat from another server when the item he was carrying on his skewer was refused. Unfortunately for us, this server did not come by our particular table. Once we had our fill of the main courses, we waited just over 15 minutes to be offered coffee and dessert. The candle at our table remained unlit, which is a small thing, but I feel these are details that should absolutely be attended to in a higher end restaurant. In the end, I don't feel the overall atmosphere, quality and service justifies the price.
I was in here last month for a bite to eat and a hot choc. I asked how big their $8 burger was, and they said in a snarky tone "Big enough", to which I was slightly upset. Nevertheless, I ordered the burger and a hot chocolate, and needless to say, the burger was small, cut in half, and I was only given half. The lettuce they used was very strange, I hated it. I felt like I was forced to eat it, as I felt that due to the service I received earlier, I would be refused a refund. The hot chocolate wasn't much better, it was weak, luke warm and tasted a little like sour milk. However, the decor is very nice, it has books to read, a live band on weekends and such, but it's not enough to save my review. Overall, I hated this cafe, and will not be coming back in a hurry.

First time here. It was as I expected. Fried seafood, cold beer, in the South End. It's not trying to be Seviche. It doesn't have to...Blue collar good time.
Food is great, alcohol less so, I wouldn't go back in a hurry or queue for too long unless I craved a burger. Happy to say I've been and say people should try it. It really depends on what you are looking for and what expectations you go with as to how much you like this place, oh and how long you queue for. Food is very well priced and is rather tasty, the beef burger is superb in fact. I do think they over do the cheese, suppose they think it makes it American but it I couldn't taste the dog in my chilli dog. I don't think the alcohol is all that amazing, decent but overly sweet cocktails regardless of what we ordered, they have character but didn't wow. Toilet was a bit of a state, but having been just the once I don't know if it was a one off.

Okay, don't get me wrong. Blue Flame has some great talent.However, I don't think their business practices are ethical. A couple of years ago, I bought $300 worth of gift certificates for my fiance who was getting a sleeve done by one of their artists. (Keep in mind the gift certificates have NO expiration date on them.) He just happened to be one of their most popular artists, so making an appointment was almost impossible. And just our luck, he has his own shop now and is no longer at Blue Flame. Blue Flame told me they would not honor the gift certificates now because they were more than a year old. I was NEVER told there was a deadline on these and there is no written expiration date anywhere. They have $300 of my money for services NEVER rendered.

THEY HAVE ALWAYS TAXED ME THE "FOR HERE" PRICE without asking if it was for here or to go. It's not the extra 26 cents I'm worried about, it's the principal. I'm thinking it's a bit of a scam to make extra money for them. Think about the 100's of people who walk through their doors every month. If everyone is taxed the "for here" price, then the money adds up. I'm wondering if that's illegal or not to not ask and to just asssume and charge people. I never notice them asking if it's for here or to go to anyone else either. SCAM! I'm reporting them to the BBB right away. The girl working there(Jessica) had an attitude when I inquired about it. She asked if I wanted my 26 cents back. I mention that I did, then she took it out of her tip jar, and threw it in my hand!!! WOW!!! Our youth has become a scum pool of wanna be gangsters with a bad attitude. I'm not returning there anytime soon. It's a shame because IO enjoy their yogurt, but not the attitude!!!!
Don't get coffee here!! It was the worst espresso I have ever had! Truck stops have better coffee. Every thing else is amazing though. And when I complained they made me another bad cup of espresso that was slightly stronger.
Beware the upsell. The staff was courteous and friendly, the shop is open on Saturdays (many are not), and they gave me a price quote within a day of my car's being in the shop. The staff seems genuinely professional, a throw-back, as other reviews have noticed. However, as others have noted, the quote I received was full of upsell. The mechanic recommended over $2,000 worth of repairs, which is at or over the listed value of the car. Admittedly, the car is old and has many issues, which the mechanic duly and rightly noted. When I requested that he give me an estimate for a bare-minimum repair to get the car running safely and pass inspection, the quote remained near $1,100. (These were done orally over the phone, so there may not be a written record of them). I took the car to another local shop, who did the repair for just over $400. The mechanic there, when shown the report from Advanced, was baffled as to how several of the "issues" in the ~$2,000 quote, specifically those regarding the fuel-injection system, could be diagnosed without a more time-intensive review than was possible (I don't necessarily believe or disbelieve this from the other mechanic; I simply report what he told me). To my mind and in my experience, Advanced's business model is to upsell its services, recommending expensive repairs which may or may not be necessary. This is a perfectly legitimate business practice that maximizes profits and likely does involve much preventive maintenance, particularly for newer cars. If money is no concern and you want a quick and what I presume would be effective repair from a local business with polite and professional employees, Advanced is your shop. The savvy customer may look elsewhere or for a second opinion, however.
The food was good. The service was mediocre at best. All the wait staff was watching TV and didn't check in on us once over a one hour meal. The restaurant was not busy at all (7 PM).
This used to be one of my favorite restaurants, but has definitely gone down hill in the last 2 years. Had my waiter tell me that they don't blacken the chicken for the salad, when I've gotten that way for years. She actually argued with me that I was wrong, they never blackened. It's not what it used to be. I still go, but half as much as I used to.

This place would probably be a solid 2 or 3 normally. However, the floor manager has no business running the front of the house. Maybe he's one of those guys that got rich in tech and decided to become a restauranteur, but he ruined our party's evening all by himself. First off we arrived early and we wanted to take advantage of happy hour. Granted we were seated at our table, but our waitress (who btw was great) mentioned that people bring their drinks down from the bar upstairs. Nope! stopped cold by our buddy the floor manager. Has to be drunk upstairs. We check into Yelp and notice that there is a special 5 course meal for $48. Nope! stopped by our buddy the floor manager again. You have to call in a day ahead, and it can only be with a reservation! They have to prepare! We point out that there are no restrictions mentioned on the Yelp check in, and what's the point of having a check in deal if you can't use it without a reservation etc. He says oh well that's supposed to be changed blah blah blah. He's either lying or he's an idiot for doing such an idiotic job in marketing. At this point we were about to walk out, but we decided screw this we're going to happy hour. We ask to move our table upstairs and we end up drinking and eating upstairs which isn't a problem since this place was less than 1/3rd filled on a week night. Our waitress upstairs was just as good as ours downstairs. Nice, pleasant and honest. When we mentioned something about our buddy the floor manager downstairs, she basically went yeah, I've gotten a few comments about him tonight. The food was OK, the only thing exceptional was how high the price is, about 30% more expensive than comparable food. I've spent less for a meal at about half a dozen Michelin starred restaurants than this place. Shoot I think I spent about the same money at Michael Mina and definitely less at Aziza before. I think I liked the crab noodles the best. That was a slightly over priced side dish, but at least it was a good size. The fried banana dessert was also good as well. The only redeeming things was that our waitresses who were good. As bad as it made me feel because of our buddy, I had left a full tip because our waitresses did a good job. Especially while being supervised by our clueless buddy the floor manager.

Study environment is good enough if some exception are avoided..it has peaceful study environment and lovely canteen full of green trees is added too..that makes it a bit perfect..if a boy choose this college , after some day probably he would feel that deliberately he put himself in the hell to survive and ll get a too much restrictions to make much hellirious his student life...if a girl choose this college. .she ll be okay with it...because this college seems sort of girls college...she ll feel secure..Because ratio of girls and boys is 80:20 ..haha.. all over this college is good for being graduate only. .
I am disappointed in Crossroads, I NEED HELP WITH MY jACK rUSSELL, WICH HAS BEEN UNDER THEIR CARE FOR 4 YEARS AND THEY ARE CLOSED THE DAY AFTER THANKSGIVING AND THE EMERGENCY ANAMILE HOSPITAL DOSENT OPEN TILL 6 PM VETS ARE DOCTORS WHY DO THEY TAKE THE DAY AFTER A HOILDAY OFF AND I CAN'T GET MY DOG INTO AN EMERCENCY TIL 6 PM.

Super slow, and they forget half your order. Boo!
I had a nice time, but the salsa was too cold to have been served and tasted a little like refrigerator. They MUST remodel the bathroom and clean it. The restroom was very bad in every way. Ample proportions, good food, service could have been better, not expensive for what you get. Thank you.
Specialisti profesionisti, asta ii defineste. Nu acord maxim pentru ca, consider intodeauna ca este loc de mai bine, desi, aceasta firma este cu mult, foarte mult, peste standardele oricarei firme cu care am lucrat.
I will start off with the good. Hotel Lungarno is decorated beautifully and the rooms are very spacious. Everything seems to be clean and the options in the mini bar are great. The room service food is okay, but too expensive for the quality. Now expect a long paragraph about the hotels service. Absolutely disgusting and should be taken down a star just for the pure lack of care for their guests. First off, they use the same taxi driver anytime you ask for a ride. He doesn't speak English, drives horribly and pretends to get lost to hike up your fare. He is not helpful in the least and they refuse to call anyone else.. not to mention he drives a vehicle from the 80s. I was absolutely DISGUSTED at the end of our stay when our luggage and my wheelchair would not fit in his car yet they literally forced us to use him AND a van. Obviously, all of our stuff would fit in the van and when I requested this the concierge went into the hotel and didn't come back outside! I have never seen something so unprofessional. The van shut the door on my grandmother and took her to the train station separately, without her consent. It literally just drove off.. leaving us to pay two taxi rides when it should have been one. The hotel also told us the one taxi was prepaid and took $75 and then the taxi driver demanded we pay him again! It was ridiculous. This hotel's staff lies and tells you that they have done things when they haven't. I called them three times to make sure they registered my wheelchair with the train station, they said it was all taken care of. I arrive and get publicly embarrassed by the Captain because no arrangements had been made. I found myself crying in front of thousands of people. They also told us they had arranged a transfer for us when they didn't. I could not go to the hotel's restaurant because it is up stairs and I was in a wheelchair at the time. For my stay I was promised two free dinners so I had arranged it to be changed into room service considering the circumstances. When I received my bill, they charged me for the whole thing. Insanity. They also told us Lungarno Details was open and my poor family had to push my across the bridge, only to find the store was closed until September. So unprofessional and they wasted so much of our time. I sincerely suggest you don't stay here, for your own good.
Closed.
Service charge automatically added on to drinks orders... Not acceptable.

I give it 3 stars, because the food was just what I wanted as far as a greasy spoon restaurant goes. However, i seem to have a different opinion of the staff and atmosphere. The staff was rude, ignored my son and I. I practically had to get my own set up. There was an older man that brought us a highchair and crackers, since after 10 minutes the waitress didn't feel the need to even give us a menu. She was more interested in the men that seem to frequent the place. The cashier didn't even say hi, or how was everything. She carried on a conversation with another patron and then wasn't going to have me sign my credit card slip. So, I asked for it and she said "not unless you want to leave a tip" Uhh yes. I think your restaurant sucks, but I'm not a douche. Anyways. Never going back.
Been there for a first time and was surprised with a good atmosphere in there. Liked live music, great songs by singers but too loud for such a small premise. Service was quite good and polite. Many compliments to beautiful waitress Olga. Didn't like covers charge for not having food actually.
Ubicacion del local muy buena, en pleno centro al lado de la playa y muy buena vista. La calidad no es muy buena, mas bien baja.
my sister worked here for a summer. good yogurt, bad location. went out of business probably after the first year. There was another yogurt place that opened up off of 99 that was more visible from the highway.

The Country Inn and Suites was about what you would expect for a budget hotel near an airport. The rooms were clean and breakfast was complimentary. My only complaint was that the smoking rooms were on the same floor as the non-smoking rooms; consequently, everything smelled like cigarette smoke. I filled out the survey they sent me after my stay and mentioned the complaint in the comment section. In response, they sent an email that said, in part: "I have addressed your concerns with our team, and I assure you we are working diligently to ensure a similar situation does not occur again in the future." How, exactly, would addressing this issue with 'our team' fix the location of the smoking rooms? Honestly, I would have rather not received a response than a response that implicitly acknowledges they didn't read my comments in the first place. If you need a place to crash and want to smoke in your room, this is probably a hotel you'd want to consider. If you want fast Internet connections, a swimming pool larger and deeper than something you'd pick up at a Walmart, and don't want to carry the faint aura of an ashtray with you to wherever you're going after the hotel, you might consider a different destination.
We would like to comment on Koine Language School. My wife and I attended classes there for three years. We had a delightful time and received an excellent introduction to Italian. As a result, we have felt comfortable communicating in Italian wherever we have traveled in Italy. During our three years at Koine, we experienced only two criticisms of the program. One of our fellow students felt the administration was less than desired. We did not feel this was true but in any case the person responsible for administration has since left Koine. The other criticism was from an American who felt she was forced to think too much and stated she would have preferred a less rigorous program. Personally, we liked being part of a program that was both fun AND resulted in our being truly immersed in the language. While our opinion is just our own, it would seem to be supported by others as Koine has been awarded Excellence Awards for the last five years in a row from Language Course S.L., a firm that specializes in evaluating language courses across Europe. In all cases, their evaluations are based on “evaluations from former students.” We believe having two language schools in Lucca is healthy because it results in competition that will encourage both programs to improve. However, there is no question in our minds we would choose Koine for a first rate education in Italian. Frannie and Bill Rich
Good place for some food but you'll be cooking it yourself as its mainly a BBQ and help yourself salad. Its got a good atmosphere thought as its pretty informal and easy to have fun.
Restaurant rather than pub, can be crowded and food sometimes disappoints.
Awful staff.... avoid at all costs! Terrible service!! We were having a beer in the beer garden when we were very rudely asked to come inside as they were closing the outside part of the venue by being approached by a horrible female bar staff saying ' you aren't even smoking so you need to go inside!' not exactly wat we were expecting... awful service!

They refuse to fix a pizza the way you want it, never enough cheese even when you pay for extra. Have found that i can take a short trip to Milton and get best pizza Ive ever ate and it is always fixed as I want it.
•Positives: We reserved a room online using Choice points, which was easy. Upon check-in for our one night stay, Ana informed my fiancé and I that she noticed we were Platinum members and upgraded our room to a suite at no extra cost. She was very friendly and welcoming. We were also informed that because of our membership, we could check out late (which apparently you need to be sure and specify you want, by the way). The lobby, elevators and our room were clean. Our king size bed was comfortable, too. •Negatives: When we got to the third floor, the hallway smelled like cigarette smoke when there were no-smoking signs posted all over. No, it's not in the best part of town, but both times we've stayed here, we've never felt unsafe. A day after checking out, we found a $50 charge on our credit card, which they said was just a hold and should have been canceled when we checked out, but wasn't until we called.
OK, so really wanted to have some of this but after looking at the menu and deciding what to try, we called and were told our 97123 address was too far. They said we could call another company and pay 10% more and they would deliver....Really?? Really poor business practice.

Staff is less but they are very co-operative. The best thing is that you can pay your mtnl bills in cash right there.
I'm Mexican but I I like to speak English and believe that ANYONE working in any type of business should be able to understand and speak the English language. The male that answered the phone should be no where near one, I knew he was Mexican but decided to speak in English. If your answering the phone, you better be able to take my order. Even though I speak spanish, it was hard to understand the English of the male that was taking my order. Spoke clearly for him and was not able to understand me, got my address wrong and stated that his location doesnt deliver so far. Made male aware that I was in the same area as store location and to verify address again. Male had someone else take my order. The second person was courteous and took my order without a problem. I ordered delivery and it got here in a timely fashion. I ordered a pan pepperoni pizza and it was delicious, still hot in the box and perfect the way i like it. Other than the "Paisa" that was trying to take my order, overall experience was good.

This place is definitely hit or miss. Some days the food will be great, and others it will suck. For instance I went in on a monday got chicken fingers, they were great; juicy and white meat and nicely fried. I went in on a sunday two weeks later and they were horrid. They were so over cooked the chicken was literally as hard as a brick and when I bit into it, my teeth instantly were sore because I couldn't bite through it. I didn't finish and left after paying my bill. However, if you point out to the staff that you do not enjoy something/there is something wrong with your food, then they will offer you a replacement without charging extra. Some days you will hardly see your waitress and other days they are very attentative, hence my saying its a hit or miss. However I hope you stop on one of their good days and enjoy. Be warned though. If you order their hot turkey sandwich, the turkey is deli turkey slice thick not real "thanksgiving" turkey you would expect.
Food sucks. Burger meat is the worst available. Fish quesadilla is nasty mess of grease and the fish is unidentifiable. Cheap plastic knife. Cheaper than cheap nasty food. You have to be seriously drunk to even hallucinate that the food is edible. Suck.
Food was ok. Beer was flat. Place was dead on an NFL Sunday afternoon. Convenient locale and friendly service.

I rarely write reviews but I feel I have to in this case. We stopped in because we were driving through and saw the exceptional Zagat score (27). I am completely baffled by this score. The food may be "good" relative to other mexican restaurants above the 45th parallel, but it was definitely not in the "Extraordinary to Perfection" range. The meat in our dishes was good (flavorful and tender), but everything else was average or poor. The tortillas, rice, and beans were typical of Michigan Mexican. The guacamole was the worst I have every been served. It appeared to be an artificial pale green colored liquid from a plastic packet with no evidence of actually containing any vegetables. The service was a bit sparse but acceptable. The decor was brightly colored, typical of a cheesy mexican chain, and the facilities were clean and well kept.
The atmosphere would be a great place to take a girl out for a nice dinner with the lighting and wine selection being perfect for the occasion. My evening started with a good service with a Jameson/baileys and Veal meatballs as an appetizer. The drink had more Jameson than baileys so great drink and the Meatballs were great.The first dinner plate (MINE) : The special, poached tilapia and rice; rice came out dry as if it has been in a warming container but not closed and i was served the top portion, but the tilapia was cooked well. Dinner plate 2 (Hers): The fettucini Alfredo sauce was watery with little taste. How do you screw up fettucini Alfredo? Thats the easiest entry to make. Im not one to complain but I paid $52 for this meal and I wouldn't care if my food sucked as long as hers was good because I am trying to impress her but she didn't even like it. Ill try it one more time before I never go back and hope that it was just a one time thing.

Very friendly and kept the drinks full. Food is really horrible. The restaurant needs to be cleaned. Not to many food items to choose from.
I decided to purchase my new car audio deck at ABC basically because they have "free" instillation. I knew I would probably slightly overpay for the deck to offset the fact it had free install. I paid a little over 130$ with install for a deck/install parts that would cost between 90-100$ on amazon so i came out pretty well. The install took only about 25-30 minutes and was clean, and the deck sounded great. As far as customer service goes, don't expect much. The guy at the car audio counter didn't even acknowledge the fact I was in the room , until i approached and told him i was looking to buy. He was pretty rude, but i never expect much when buying retail. While waiting for my install i bowsed the store and noticed much of whats for sale isnt priced directly, forcing you to interact with sales people. Do your homework before hand,[],no what yor buying, and youll be good
Frickin always packed on the fuel islandisland
Good food. Would be better if you could change up the menu. Did not care for oysters in every meal.
Food here is at sub-par. The Pho here is terrible, I know if it wasn't the only place that served this stuff around here, then this place would prolly be unsuccessful. The service here was, completely horrible. OB is known as a stoner community, and well this place shows that this is still a very real description of the area. I DO, however recommend their happy hour, they serve dollar beers here, not always the best beer, but for a dollar you can't complain too much. The only reason to come here is they have decent beer for a dollar at happy hour, but eat before you come...
A petit bar with good selection of wine.
Good, not great. I've had it both there and catered, and both times it was just OK.
very expensive
Good food but they keep screwing up the orders. And 1 hour and 45 minutes for 2 beefs with fries on a Tuesday night???
Very good fresh and delicoius goodness...if it is youre first one its a starter... :)
After dining in and ordering a salad and a regular slice I thought the place deserved a second visit. So on my second trip there I ordered a large Hungry Sasquatch (Pie with the works.) Which was actually pretty decent. The toppings were plentiful, the ingredients were fresh and the pie was cooked through without a burnt bottom. I was pleased with the size of the large as well. I also ordered a plain Sicilian pizza. Now growing up on Long Island in New York, I've always knew Sicilian pies to be a square pie cut into squares, with a lot of olive oil and sauce that drips down your arm while you eat it with the obvious chucks of tomatoes through out. I was super surprised and almost insulted to find that this Sicilian was cut into shapes that a normal pie would be cut into. The end result being a square pie with really odd triangle like shapes for slices...(I wish I could upload pictures here for you guys. It was quite a sight.) The dough was super thick almost like a bread stick and very dry. Very little sauce and not one drop of olive oil anywhere. I was actually rather amused and fairly confused by this Sicilian. I mean a simple image search on google will show you that a Sicilian pie is supposed to be cut into squares. I just found this lack of knowledge alarming and almost comical. The beer selection however is plentiful, the regular and specialty pies are decent but the Sicilian was an absolute joke. Not only was it cut wrong and dry, they didn't insert any pizza tables into the boxes to keep the cheese from sticking to the top of the boxes. I mean the mistakes they made are, I think, an insult to pizza 101. So all in all I give the place 3 stars. Staff was friendly and the place was clean from what I could see. A nice place to stop in for lunch and get a slice and a pint, but that's about it. A+ for effort.

This place has good food, but if you have kids dont waste your money on the kids meal. My kids got the quesadilla meals, and they were $4. They came with a very small cup of rice, a drink, and a "quesadilla" so small it could fit in my hand. My kids left this place hungry. If you have kids, send them to Barros next door before you eat at Cafe Rio.

I will start by saying that I like living in Park Lafayette. My boyfriend and I are planning on staying here for a few years, because we loved the amenities, view, location, and felt very secure. I also enjoyed the mix of residents that were young professionals and empty nesters, and that it's pet friendly. I've never experienced any fire alarms going out in the middle of the night, nor have I ever heard any of my neighbors through the wall, and I have never had to wait for a workout machine in the gym.
The fish from fish and chips was soggy and tasteless. The baked beans from the bangers and mash tasted like some beans straight out of the can warmed up in the microwave. The mashed potatoes were phenomenal. The flavor of the links was odd. Not to my liking, but it may be an acquired taste. The service was nothing to brag about, but no complaints either. TLDR: Pricy restaurant, the food wasn't great, and the service was average.
We moved to Missouri from the East Coast a year ago and Kato was the first sushi restaurant we found and tried. At first it was okay - not amazing, but good enough. I admit, I have pretty high standards coming from the coast with the fresh seafood variety and majorly impressive sushi establishments. As we've eaten at Kato over the last year, it has changed a lot. I'm not sure what is going on, -but- (1.) most of the nigiri I've ordered has been doused with lemon my past few orders (2.) I've had a few orders messed up (3.) the selection given with the sushi entrees have gone way downhill, forcing hubby and I to order piece by piece, which, of course, increases our bill by 30%. I hate to say it, but we're finally going to try somewhere new. Nice people, the staff has always been friendly, the place is relaxed and nice enough inside - but I wouldn't highly recommend it.

Clean and comfortable, the decor just isn't my personable preference. Lots of wood, so kind of feels like a forest
Really Good....best nearby medabakkam junction. Reasonable price too....

Great food for lunch or dinner.
Neuer Küchenchef, daher angepasste Rezension: Restaurant: Kleine Karte mit gehobenem Standard, netter und schneller Service. Auch für Sonderwünsche offen, vielfältiges Amuse-Gueule. Sehr gut, aber leider nur selten geöffnet, weshalb wir leider mehrfach auf die Bauernstube ausweichen mussten. Bauernstube: Große Auswahl, teilweise auf der Terrasse auf offenem Grill zubereitet. Speisen zwar auf gleichem Niveau, Service leider nicht. Von 6 Besuchen 5 mal Service nicht zufriedenstellend (z. B. 20 Minuten warten auf Getränkebestellung(!), 20 Minuten auf Getränke, 25 Minuten auf Rechnung). Daher leider 2 Sterne Abwertung. Aufgrund des miserablen Services werde ich wohl trotz des hervorragenden Essens nicht wiederkommen. Schade.
Menu di pesce: 1 insalata di mare(solo seppie e 2 gamberetti) 1 spaghetto allo scoglio(3cozze andate a male...1 scampo e 2 vongole) 1 grigliata mista non male 1 verdura del giorno(erba cotta)...prezzo del pranzo decisamente alto!!!
Driver was courteous and arrived promptly as advised on the phone. No credit card facilities available, cash only.

The nachos had a distinct lack of cheese.
Overpriced, I would not bother returning to this pub unless I wished to impress some Londoners! The Cumberland sausage was virtually tasteless. There is a good selection of beers.
I would recommend vikram hospitals a few blocks further down the lane if it's not an emergency.
Nice place for arts & crafts.
i have stayed at the spring hill before a couple of times and have had great customer service rooms are decent and love the free breakfast in the morning and the rate is fair so that's why i went back this labor weekend, but this time it was different when i arrived the front desk was nice, booked my 2 rooms and started to get ready for the concert when we came back we parked or vehicles right in front of the front desk in plain eye sight of the front desk, well lit area so we trusted nothing would happen to our vehicles but to our surprise when we woke up in the morning they had stolen one of our trucks and the front desk clerk was just seating in the front lobby watching TV and drinking coffee! we made the police report and the manager (general manager) David just pretty much said sorry we aren't liable nobody saw anything we don't have cameras outside. he told me you guys can stay a little longer because we needed to go rent a vehicle since we had 5 adults 4 kids and a newborn and only 1 truck now and it was almost check out time. he told us we could have complimentary drinks and snacks (i guess that was his way of making it up to us for having our truck stolen right in front of the front desk basically) when our husbands came back with the rented car we were still in shock about the situation and really hadn't eaten and still hadn't packed and the GM David told one of the kids, "i know your situation but when are ya'll checking out? tell your parents to call me" when i went to the front desk he was gone and a new guy was there i told him are keys weren't working so he reset them i asked him, are we going to be charged for staying over 12pm? he wasn't aware of our situation, i told him what happened then he said, "no don't worry about it, i understand" so i told him okay we are gonna eat then get our stuff ready and will be out and that's exactly what we did well not even an 1 hr later we get a call from the front desk asking when are we checking out anybody who has kids knows its not easy feeding kids and packing everything in less than an hr but we did our best and got out of the hotel. Its sad that this happened to us and we still felt rushed out by the hotel because we went over the check out time i thought they would have handled it better but never going back to that hotel. i would highly recommend you don't either not just because of the service but because that area is not safe the police said there was a high crime rate in that area with cars getting broken into and stolen at hotels we found that out a little too late.
My girlfriend and I had 2 completely different experiences. My experience: I love my personal trainer, he motivates and encourages me to do my best. He never forgets what my goals are and he's pushing me to try new exercises, which is something I needed because I was addicted to free weights. My girlfriend's experience: Her personal trainer would forget about their sessions, came up with excuses/lies and would constantly forget her phone number even after she would call/text him to confirm their sessions. She gave up and discontinued her service and her membership. The only reason why I am no longer continuing my business with them is because I can no longer afford it vs my girlfriend who had a terrible experience and was not getting the service she wanted.

Went here with a few mates for a general get together. Got there at 7.30 and ordered a Chicken Parmy as did all my mates. Was a bit pricey considering I would call this place a fancy pub, but then again, this place is in the city. It took over an hour for the Parmys to rock up at our table and it certainly wasn't busy in the restaraunt. They had gotten my order wrong and given me a Beef Parmy instead of a Chicken. I certainly wasn't going to complain but the waitress quite literally pulled the plate out of my hand and whisked it off to the kitchen without an apology of any kind. 10 minutes later my Chicken Parmy rocked up and all was good. The food itself was very good, one of the best parmys I've ever had however a bit of salad on the plate wouldn't go amiss. Overall would recommend this place to someone wanting to try a lot of different types of Coopers beers however their are much better and cheaper places to go.

If you don't mind a breakfast that appears to be inspired by AM/PM gas station, a charity mission, or re-heated rations, the Holiday Inn will do. Their rooms are smoke-free and clean, overall. The rates are reasonable, and the hotel is only 45 minutes from Mammoth. We just can't get past the breakfast: very hard biscuits, one kind of diet yogurt, green bananas, refill of bread, knives and edible food was a regular request...even when it was slow.

Desert Ridge Courthouse. SLLOOOOOW. They say that it's in order of sign in, but ppl in custody go first.... Which means, I have NO clue when I'll be going. Plus side- Employees are VERY friendly, even the judge, if you can believe it! It's clean, well lit, and plenty of seating.
Food: The only food items they had were fried (except hot dogs and hamburgers), No guacamole, Nothing was clear what kind of meat it was, and they were very stingy with the "Free" alcohol which they repeatedly emphasized that tips were not included. Overall the food tasted terrible except for the chips and salsa) Beach: Dirty, could not sleep on it because people would come by literally more than once a minute trying to sell you stuff. The excursions they suggested were not good at all and the "Jungle Tour" simply shuttled you from one sparse set of shops to another and tried to get you to buy things there. The final restaurant we went to was the only place you could get food as it was in fact in the jungle and it cost about 15 dollars for a piece of chicken and a couple of leaves of lettuce. I do not recommend this tour option. The staff, however, were very friendly and helpful when you asked anything of them. Almost everyone spoke both English and Spanish (So did everyone in Puerto Vallarta, it seemed)
Por manage poor food I don't like it shut it down.

In looking for a Plano Lawn Care, I came across these guys and had them service my rental property. They do a quality job and are pretty consistent.

Used to go here in 2012 when prices were cheap and portions were large, to be fair I still come here in 2013 despite prices going up and portions getting smaller purely because it's convenient with the kids. The play area is welcome distraction while we wait for our food to arrive (which could sometimes be up to an hour) and the food is obviously not made fresh on the premises (correct me if i'm wrong) but is acceptable. If you're looking for a clean establishment to take the kids to eat with semi healthy food options then this place is worth considering.

I bought a Numark NS6 on Labor Day. I paid with cash and was quite happy with my purchase when I left. After tinkering with the controller for about 5 days or so, the effects knobs stopped working due to some sort of defect. I had my wife take the controller back with receipt for an exchange for the same controller. When she came home, she returned with another NS6 but in an open box and with the power supply missing. I do not blame my wife since she doesn't really have any knowledge of the equipment. She said an employee did all of the work for her and seemed knowledgeable. So it seems to me that he did this intentionally. I don't know when it became acceptable to exchange one defected item for another open box item with parts missing. Unacceptable. We live an hour and a half away, so this will be our 3rd time driving up there to get a working piece of equipment. I'm tempted to just take my money back and walk away. I will only shop here again if I have to.
I used to like going there for a specific facialist, but then she got fired and they wouldn't give me her contact info or pass my info along to her. I really liked her too. :-(
Does not have a typical "café" atmosphere but the place grows on you. It's not a chain after all. Food was good coffee was good. Would recommend to friends.
Poor Service and ridiculous... wow seriously.... ridiculous

This is great pizza!! My only complaint is that they close the place down on some days without notice! Even on a Friday Night sometimes (universal pizza night). Management may want to think about getting some predictability with its hours of operation.
Near to my home....
They don't take foodstamps (ebt) there.
Food and decor were good. Service was real slow. Had to ask about why we didnt get our salads when the menu said it was part of the dinner and waitress said we had to request it. Had to keep asking for refills. Does give free piece of cheescake for b day.
This is the only 24 hour CVS in my area so this is my "home" CVS. I love CVS as a store but this particular location is one of the messiest stores I have ever been to. They often do not have the store tagged with the current sales until Monday or Tuesday. The photo counter is a HUGE mess stacked with boxes and trash. I wish this location would get some better management that would take care of this place....it has a lot of potential.

The teenagers who work there an incredibly unprofessional. I stepped on a wasp there last summer (ow!) an had to get first aid. First they asked me I I was allergic to wasps, I said no, and the girl responded with "good because were out of epi-pens." They took my vitals while talking about high school gossip and then had to ask three time for some ice to put on the swelling. (i did a first aid/cpr class and i know what to do for a single un allergic bee-sting) Then I asked if someone could get my bag bc it had my glasses in it because I was getting a headache from not wearing them. Nobody went for it, thank god my friend came to check up on me and got me my bag and glasses. I took an Advil I had in my purse then went home to get the stinger out myself. I worry about what would have happened if I had a serious medical issue

In 2006, I put a deposit on a corner-unit, ocean-view garden apartment with washer and dryer for $1900 though I couldn't see it because tenants were in it. Two days before I was to move in, I was allowed to see the apartment. It was beautiful except for the mess below at the LifeGuard station but I figured I would put up some potted plants on the patio to block it out and look at the ocean. While I was looking at the apartment, the manager told me the apartment was $2100 and if I didn't want to pay it that she had another tenant interested. Why had others seen it before me? Why were they even showing it when I laid down a deposit two weeks ago? We settled on $2000 but she looked at me like she hated my guts. After I moved in, I found workmen standing in my living room after I got out of the shower. Each one told me they knocked and when no one answered, they unlocked the door, came in and just waited for me to come out of my bedroom. They said they were there to let the cable guy in but both times they had the wrong address. This was not a good start. Once I was settled in and the weather was so nice, I tried working at home but the construction across the street was so dusty and loud that I had to close my windows and go back to the office. Evenings or weekends were better when one could sit on the patio, have a glass of wine and look at the water in peace. I loved walking down Washington Street to grab a bite to eat or taking a run along the Marina. The location couldn't be beat. When my lease was up, I was sad to go because every place becomes home after awhile but I got another job transfer. I gave a 30-day notice and the staff did an inspection of my apartment and said it still looked new so I would probably get my cleaning deposit back. I asked if I could use my last month's deposit for my last month and they said no so I paid the last month. The first week of the month, I packed and shipped most of my things but I didn't finish because I had a flight out to where I was being relocated. When I came back four days later, I was locked out of my apartment. I went to the front desk and the manager I dealt with when I moved in told me they threw out the rest of my stuff and cleaned the apartment. I asked how could she do that when I paid until the end of the month and they had a last month deposit? She said they inspected it for a showing (odd since I couldn't view my apartment when tenants were in it) and they thought I left so they clean it and planned on refunding me the difference. There was nothing I could do about my stuff because the trash had already been collected. Ironically, I received a bill from Archstone. I called their corporate headquarters and they did an investigation. The fall out: The manager never reported to Archstone she locked me out early of a paid month, the apartment didn't rent the next month so she used my last month's deposit and when the apartment rented two weeks later Archstone expected to be paid for those two weeks. After their investigation, I got a check for the days I paid when they locked me out early, a check for my last month's deposit and the bill removed from collections. A value couldn't be established for the items that were thrown away so I received nothing. In the end, I wish I hadn't ignored that first warning flag because I found out staff make a commission off how high they sell the apartment and I totally believe that manager threw out my stuff and tried to keep my money and hurt my credit because I negotiated $100/month less than what she could have gotten for that apartment. It was a nice place when I lived there and corporate did fix the problem but the manager was a complete nutcase and I hope they fired her for her actions.

This is a dirty old pub that we go to with our coworkers for an inexpensive fast sit-down meal. It is also good for 5a7 as the beer is decent. If you're looking for healthy food, this is not the place! (then, go to CDL club next door, they have health food.) So the beer here is good and good price. For food, there are certain choices you should steer clear from - like the Steerburger, it has been known to be undercooked and questionable. If you're going burger, ALWAYS order the Royal burger (btw, menu photos on Urbanspoon are out of date, the menu is surprisingly still the same or almost, but the prices are not. The Royal is 3 bucks more, for example). The fries are greasy but delicious. The rest of the menu is okay (i've tried the fish and chips and the tourtiere), but know this is a worker's pub, hopping at lunch and 4pm only (happy hour), so if you are a tourist, only go here if you're looking for greasy highway-stop food, and a heavy-belly + stomach ache afterwards! Enjoy!
Scheduling an appointment is very difficult. Long hold time. My family has been seeing different providers here for several years. Our favorite, Heidi Warner, is no longer with the practice. Medication refills take at least a week. On the positive side, most providers are very attentive to your needs.

Negotiated a great price over the internet. Got the model, color and just the accessories I wanted. Went to pick up the car and that is where they fell short. Even though I had given them all my information, including Social Security number, and a Credit Card for a deposit. When I arrived nothing had been filled out, or processed. So, I wasted over 3 hours just sitting around waiting for the salesman, business manager and financing people to fill out forms. I felt like they didn't respect me, or value my time. It was clear that as soon as the deal was done, it was no longer important to anyone in management that I dealt with professionally and delivery of the car be expedited.
No hours listed outside the restaurant. Stood in the rain while employees watched us look at an outdoor menu. Yankee magazine lists them as the best chowder. Too bad they couldn't mention that they have lousy service on June 13, 2013

Love taking my 4 year old here. Plenty of room . He's outgrown the waddle pool but the big one is perfect for.his age group. Plenty of space from the 2ft to 4 ft section. Pool goes up yo 5 ft which is just enough for me )
We went here a couple weeks ago and were somewhat disappointed. The atmosphere and decor was great! But the food left much to be desired. My burrito was soggy and the onion rings were tough/flavorless. I hope that they can fix the food because the place has a ton of potential!

Went once and received poor quality food (burnt pizza crust, hair in the salad). Gave it one last try a month later, and waited forever for a simple order of 2 slices of pizza, with almost no one in the restaurant. Seriously? And, once again...burnt on the bottom of the crust to the point of making it inedible. Fool me once...never again. The wait staff was trying, but the folks cooking the food need a review on how to bake a pizza. Done going there, and will take my business elsewhere. Just didn't cut it with me. To the reviewer below who said it was "the best pizza in NC..." I feel for ya...you obviously haven't had very good pizza.
Gun range was ridiculously hot. It was set at 91 degrees when it was 96 outside. There's not much point in shooting inside when the set the temperature just as high. Their rentals are $15 for a relatively small selection (except the glocks). They also box their ammo with some weird/random name but the ammo inside is something else (i.e. Independence with Blazer Ammo, and some other name with Federal ammo inside it) Also, they don't fully honor the Groupons they offer. The Groupon states two rental handguns and 100 rounds of ammunition total. However, when we showed up, they said the groupon is restricted to only .22 handguns and ammunition, which were only about 3 handguns and maybe a pair of rifles.
The food was great! The service was terrible! Never been to a restaurant before that didn't use a typical chart/section system for their servers. The servers here were all over the place. On the patio one minute, in the dining room the next, constantly flying past each other and flying past our table. If they had sections like most places I think it would have been a much better experience. We spent most of our time there waiting, and waiting, and waiting... Buuut the food was indeed tasty.

lots of potential but poor execution. very nice inside but poor unfriendly service. £15 for 3 courses good value but fish cakes were devoid of any fish and tasteless. Pudding good and Alacarte menu looked ok overall disappointing.
Park Plaza Pizza has been around for ages. Their food in general, is maybe best described as a guilty pleasure. You know the food will be greasy and cheesy, but it will be delicious. Their pepperoni pizzas are actually very unique, if you were to order pepperoni pizzas from the closest 50 pizza joints, you would be able to pick this pizza out from all the rest every time. They have a number of other items on the menu very similar to your standard bar food, but maybe a slight notch better than most bars.
Kind of slow pizza delivery, but pizza is usually great.
July 8th 2013, The overall stay was Fair to Good. The Bath Tub was patched, but not finished. I was a little disappointed to find out from the desk clerk that no rooms had Jetted Hot Tubs as presented in the last 2 pictured (#15 &16) on Roadway Inn's website. I think this a straight out Misrepresentation regarding the Jetted tub!!! The price is good, but you get what you pay for, so I guess it all balances out.

I have gone to this location a couple of times but last night will be the last. Their staff is very young so they seem disorganized at times but get the food out quick. The problem I have is I got food poisoning from there soup and have been up all night. I finally decided I was not going to sleep tonight and wrote this review. They have good food, average service, but beware of the soup!
These apartments are so Poorly managed. They lack the funds to renovate and the property lacks efficient equipment. For instance, the gates will close on your vehicle even if it is still crossing the gate. The weight machines in are rarely serviced and the treadmills look like they were picked up from walmart. The corporate office will not be calling you (a concerned tenant) even after leaving voicemails after voicemails. The Management is tricky. Sometimes they are great, sometimes they are not. For the most part the maintenance team is great. Quick and efficient. The biggest problem is that the buildings are old. I dealt with cricket hunter wasp for Two and Half months before being let out of the lease. They tried everything and the wasp were dying, everywhere in my house, but not disappearing. I did not have a good experience here, but others did. they didn't write a review but they have been here for years. Oh, also they have a huge cat problem. I have to smell cat poop every time i come home, not fun.

Certainly not the best Newbury Comics store I've been to. Took them 10 minutes to help me get what I needed. When someone did come to me and I asked for a "8.5 women size" pair of shoes for a gift, she arrogantly said "then pick up the one you want and give it to me." Then returned with a size 8.5 men's shoes (too bad I did not notice her error until the next day only), and when at the cashier he offered me a gift receipt, which I said yes to...and he forgot to print it. Really not a good service this time around!
Admitting that it is a good place to eat Sushi, I am always disappointed by the service there. There was once a bunch of friends gather here and order the buffet. No one attend to us 30 min after we get seated. Most surprising thing is, the first appetizer we ordered finally come, after we paid our bill :( . I notice that there are very few people serving the tables, and that might be why we get this terrible experience. Maybe it will be a better choice for lunch, if it is not so crowded and you have lots of time and great patience.

I have been a regular at this location for over 10 years. About 2-3 years ago, I noticed a big drop in the quality of the food - maybe under new management or using new ingredients? But whatever it was, the food does not taste appealing. We decided to give it one last try yesterday and both the meat lasagna and the spagheti with meat sauce had a very peculiar taste. If that's all there was to it, then I would not be writing this review, but there is more. We both ordered soups wioth our meals and told the waiter to upgrade our cups to bowls. I was expecting to pay an extra buck, or at worse, the difference in the price between the cup & bowl, but instead I was charged over $7 for two additional cups of soup. Not only is this ludicrous, it borders on thievery. So in addition to lousy, overpriced food, they look to rip off the clients who have supported them over the years, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!
Closed. :( I'll miss them - a great lunch spot.

The service wasn't that great. We had to really try hard to find the waitress when we wanted something. The kitchen for some reason was closed that night and all they had was plain pizza which wasn't that good. But the music was and the ambient was really good and engaging

We tried the carne asada tacos, ham and cheese torta, and milanesa torta. You definitely get more for you dollar with the torta. The tacos were small and came with no fixings. The taste was pretty good, especially the milanesa. They served a side of beans that I found too salty. I wasn't happy with the service. There were no smiles. It took a long time to get our food, and the order was not complete. We ordered baked potatoes but were given beans. Though I liked most of the food when we went, it seems like a place where quality may vary day to day. I have no regrets dining there, but will not likely visit again.

It was packed and the doorman said comon in, pleanty of space. There were no open table and no space by the bar. I waited by the restroom and waited for someone to leave. I got a seat at the bar and the barteneder pressured me into getting some weird south jmaican beer which tasted like crap and i didnt finish it. He was so exstatic that i try this nerw beer , it felt like he was going to die if i didnt like it. So i said it was good. IT WAS NOT. I ordered a burger and fries, the food was ok, I waited 40 minutes for it, but its busy so its ok. anyways Im not comin back, unless i have a reservation.
If you come here expecting good Thai food you will be disappointed, that is if you know what good Thai food is. if you want real authentic Thai you gotta try Chai Thai. Super small location serving up huge flavors at decent prices. I live 5 minutes walking from Bai-Yok and I won't go back, ever.

We've given them several chances as the awesome spot on the bay is right by my house but UGH first of all CHANGE YOUR OIL!!! Service is horrible I can go on and on about the crappy experiences I've had. I'm finally never going back.
Don't do the "Beers around the World" or the "Cocktail Cruise" at this pub - they don't put your names up. (6 months later and at least 4 enquiries). Food and atmosphere good. Pleasant and competent bar staff.
During Spec (Crappie) season the place is packed on the weekends, not to mention that it crawls with Fish and Wildlife cops so you better have all you need on your boat or expect a ticket. Sometimes its better to launch across the river.
LOUD, Overpriced, poor service. No place for a peaceful meal with friends.
All of their saltwater tanks look like trash and have cyno and other crap. But after looking around for a bit I got a frag that looked in good shape. Took it home and tested their water....Nitrates were 0ppm.

Seafood and vegetables were fresh. Food was delivered quickly to the table. Squid was a little overcooked in the seafood combo, but otherwise very good. The waiter was attentive but came off as surly.

Food was good but I am disappointed that a restaurant can't offer something other than fries as a side item. There should be choices at this price.
Halftime is under new management, apparently, and has an all-new lunch menu to go with the new management. I came in just after noon today for lunch, and was the fourth customer. The only waitress took my order (sliders and fries) and brought me my soda. My meal (3 small sliders and an order of fries) took about 35 minutes to reach my table. The waitress was friendly enough checking on me and refilling my drink, but never once mentioned the long wait, or offered to check on the food. The food itself was good. The sliders were well seasoned, and cooked perfectly. The menu claimed one slider would be dressed with the chef's homemade BBQ sauce, but I realize now that it wasn't. The fries were nicely done, crispy, but not burnt. The sliders and fries were served in a plastic basket with a paper liner - standard bar food plating. From what I could see, there isn't a seat in the restaurant without a direct line of sight to a tv, including a massive projection screen taking up most of one wall. A few "sporty" knick knacks line the walls, but not much else in terms of decor. Halftime has 4 beers on tap, two light beers, an ultra light, and Blue Moon. I noticed about a dozen bottled beers, the most "exotic" being Guinness and Dos Equis. They have a full bar, however, and appeared to have a few specialty drinks available. This seems like it would be a nice place to watch a game or two, drink light beer, and have some wings, or other sportsy food. As of right now, I can't recommend it for anything else. I want to come back and try Halftime for dinner, and to catch a game or two. I hope that service and meal times can improve by then.
Went here on a Thursday evening with my wife and two young daughters. Whilst the service in terms of taking orders was quick and pleasant we waited about 50 minutes for our food. When the food did come we asked if there had been a mix up in the kitchen, our waitress came back to tell us she'd checked and we'd only been waiting 20 minutes! It's a shame because the food was really nice but I can't risk going back with two young children if they can't see the difference between 20 and 50 minutes
The workers are nice and the food is amazing. The best dishes are chicken ceaser salad and shrimp spaghetti.

More of a neighborhood go-to spot than a destination gem. The pasta dishes are predictable and bland - the sort of thing your nephew in college could whip up from boxes and cans in the cupboard. The pizza is okay, but certainly not worth the price. You know why people love Mama's? They dump processed mozzarella cheese on everything and give you a free little ice cream cone for dessert.

I got the large chicken souvlaki dinner. The chicken was over-cooked and dry, the potatoes were okay - though not very flavourful, and the rice tasted like it came straight from a pack of uncle-bens instant microwave rice. For spending about $20 for my food, I was not filled up, nor was I satisfied by the flavour or the amount. Avoid this place - of course, when someone stands out front and practically drags you in saying it is the best Greek food, while the restaurant is mostly barren, then that should be large enough indicator to avoid the place.

It's a buffet with all that comes with being a buffet: huge selection, questionable sharing of communal dishes with strangers and children. Some parents don't teach their kids not to lick the serving spoons at buffets or stick their hands in. Some dishes are fresh and good, others have spent a little too much time sitting untouched. Always crowded though and the food isn't good enough to explain it for me.

I have never been in this place because they deliver they take almost an hour to get anything done. They are extremely pricey and do not make up for lying to you. We have probably spent almost $ 500 with these people over 6 months and its just sad.
The nature is good but there are too many drift woods on the beach. Wish the government can spend more time and money to maintain this place. It will be great if there is some experts can explain the geography to the tourist.
Ottima pizza ed ottimi prezzi soprattutto il mercoledì, sempre gentilissimi. Consigliato
The most arrogant servers I have met. Table of eight. Seven people received their food in 20+- min. OK. I had to ask about the last person. Waiter told me I should "chill out". Asked for manager. He said that the waiter told him I was unreasonable. Will never eat there again. We all know the food is mediocre at best....just wanted to have the coast experience.

Our visit was on Friday evening. The bar area was very busy but a table became available. We asked if we could sit there but a waitress informed us that a group from the bar was waiting for a table. We then proceeded to the restaurant area. My husband went to use the restroom and noticed that the waitress gave the table to a group that had just entered the premises. We ordered drinks and a appetizer and three dinners. The waitress asked us how our dinner was a we told her that my daughter did not like the Talapia. My husband tasted it also and it had a bad taste.(thawed out to long) My husband is in the Hotel Restaurant Business. The waitress did not even ask what the problem was, she only said ok and walked away. Unfortunately my daughter in all did not have a meal. I believe there should have been some sort of compensation. We just recently moved to Allendale from the West Coast and wanted to try out a restaurant in our area, especially a family owned restaurant that has been here for so many years. The parking lot was full of cars which is generally a good indication in itself. I would really like to come back to the restaurant and feel like this could be my neighborhood bar and grill.

I have to say the first few months were chaotic but, there was a change in company and there has been 3 changes in property manager since we moved in Feb 2012. I'd have to say things have improved greatly over the past few months with the latest manager. They have since opened a resident services building so people who live here don't have to wait eternity for the useless temps in the leasing office to help out. They also opened a business center. The Amenities have never been closed off to me as a resident and I appreciate the gym, track and fitness programs that have been implemented over the past few months. Originally I was disappointed because they sucked us into all the grandeur then, it sucked to live here but, they are finally making good on all their promises that influenced us to move in the first place. Maintenance is under new management and they have gotten better as well. Our entire building received brand new water heaters last week. The prices of apartments fluctuate wildly so, if you come in one week and the rent seems insane, try back again in 2 weeks and it will likely be reasonable. Ask about unrenovated units. There aren't many but, if they are available, they are a good price and the appliances work (at least mine do).

The food was alright but they were extremely rude. The servers gave us the bill after having only one plate. After eating we complained to the manager about the service and he behaved like he did not understand english and could not help us. We asked to speak to the general manager of the store he refused and then proceeded to call a lady who spoke to us and agreed that the servers and the manager had done nothing wrong so me and my friend decided not to pay for the service. The manager got annoyed and started running after us yelling and cursing at us. I will never go back to this place it is very over priced and the service and embarrasment was not worth it.

Beware: stay clear of this business. There are many other options in the Boston/Lexington area where your business is so much more appreciated. After a couple several mediocre experiences and one bad experience (blamed on large group and assumed they couldn't handle 6+people), I decided to give it one more try last weekend- which, now, I realize was my LAST time stepping into this establishment. On a Thursday night (mind you hours on their website indicate Thursday - Saturday: 11:30am - 10:30pm), myself and two co-workers perused in at about 7:45P for dinner and maybe a couple of drinks (at least 30-50$/person). As we were being seated, the waitress shed a vibe that she'd rather be dead then wait on us. Once seated, she told us the kitchen was closing at 8.....ahhh I get the sour look now. Isn't this the job you signed yourself up for? How else do you make money if you won't seat and feed customers? We then [stupidly] asked if we would be rushed out/could we still order all things on the menu/could we sit and have a few drinks? She gave us a BLANK look and then after much time said well, we have all been here since this morning and we are tired, ready to go home. I looked at my friends and collectively said to the woman as we got up to leave "No Thanks". As we walked out, she didn't offer an "I'm Sorry" or "I feel really bad, this is not how we operate". She only muttered, "well, there is the tavern across the street". Take NOURISH'S employee's recommendations: Vine Brook Tavern in Lexington MA (across the street from Nourish- which won't be in business much longer anyways). We had a FABULOUS meal, amazing customer service and we would ALL be back. I think the rest of Lexington was there too (not too crowded). DO yourself a favor, enjoy the Tavern.

This is some of the WORST Chinese food I have ever had. Honestly I refuse to eat here anymore . Since was the only Chinese joint in town I kept going back. The third time back I was physically ill. It is no surprise to me another Chinese Restaurant opened in the same plaza next to Food Lion not 400 feet away. There food is not "great" but it is a lot better and hours later I do not feel ill.
Very friendly prices are affordable I will use them again. Other florist in the area was 50% higher

Been traveling to Best Westerns a lot recently. This one is a disappointment. Hard to get into the driveway from the freeway. The place needs a little refurishment. The beds are small. The TVs are old tubes, their cable sucks (fuzzy and few channels). Bathrooms small and outdated. Rooms are hard to get around in. The fences between the parking lot and the rooms need more "holes" in them so you can get to your vehicles easier.
After much negotiation, my wife and I forked over $170 for initiation, to get the relatively low monthly fee of $49.99 (includes both of us). Don't pay any more than this. Bluff leaving if you have to. They are arrogant and jerky and will do anything to make a sell.
I went in the Valley Mall store at 1:10 PM on Friday June 15. I was in the store 3 minutes. I was seen by 3 salespeople who ignored me. They lost about $500 that day.
Insomma via. .. se ne potrebbe fare a meno di andarci...

Our server, Dan, really did not want to be there. It was a slow night, workers were just standing around, but we could not get anyone to refill my son's drink. Food was okay, not great. We went to have fun. Quite disappointed.
Clean Environment. Great Over looking Views
Over-priced. Pretentious. Booked a party of 11 over a week in advance for NYE, they even called the night of the reservation to verify. Showed up 10 minutes before the res, unapologetically made us wait over 45 minutes. Walked out. Will never go back under any circumstances. By the by, Javier's nearby was sympathetic to what happened and sat us immediately. Better food, prices, and environment.

Great airport for passengers, clean and efficient. Can't afford to park my car in the short term though at £4.60 for less than half an hour, absolute money-grabbing rip-off !! AND it's not even covered !!! Take a lesson from Glasgow EDI don't get in the same boat as Cal-Mac !!!!!
Beautiful and clean theater. Staff was a mixed bag, some exceptional, others just our right rude and amazingly annoying. You need to tell the dude that sits outside the concert venues who seems to know everything and explains it all at the top of his lungs to shut the hell up. The facilities are immaculate, albeit a tad stuffy, ideal for theater performance or low key music performance. This is not a venue for full out band performances. The rigid seating charts drastically takes away from the live music experience.
Small Shoppe. Good for the area but there's a Starbucks down the street.

Walked in to get ammo which they didn't have for any of my firearms. Tried to ask about a rifle on the wall and the employees blew me off. So I asked when they would get my ammo in stock and just got a shrug and I dunno. Not a very professional business at all and I'll never return

Read the reviews there and went because everyone said it was affordable. I just needed a trim and this place was closest to me. Not affordable compared to the big chains. Definitely not a knock on quality because I did get a good haircut, but it was a bit pricey for just a quick trim.
W menu pięknie w rzeczywistości po najmniejszej linii oporu. Do oscypka miala byc konfitura z żurawiny miodu i wina, a byla żurawina ze sloiczka. Podobnie inne dodatki np. miód z plastiku do herbaty.

The beef is not halal. I called on 7/14/2013 to verify and was told it isn't halal. I noticed a previous review mentioning that they had halal beef so I called to verify. I haven't been to this place yet but I think I will soon. I certainly love NY pizza and if their's comes close, I'll probably turn into a regular customer. I'm leaving it at 3 stars until I get there.

The hotel lobby is nice. The room (Biggest suite they had) was on the smaller side, and not too accomodating for a child. The room was really dusty / dirty, like it wasn't used or cleaned for a few months. THE WORST PART is the $40 a night for parking.
I've been going to this Chipotle a lot over the past year but recently (past 5-10 trips) the portions have changed substantially and not for the better (mainly the rice and meats). I'm not sure if this is due to a new company policy or the fact that the staff has changed. I'm paying the same amount of money as before, except now I only receive half of the amount of food. I've even said something to the staff, such as can I have more rice or more meat. For the rice they gave me about a quarter of a scoop more (at the most) and for the meat I was told I would have to pay double, however I used to get double this amount in the past and was never told I had to pay more. It's come to the point where I don't plan on going back, which is kinda sad as this used to be my favorite place to go for lunch.

I liked the sangría with sorbet, but frankly I have had better ones in other places such as Café Ibérico in Chicago and Dominick's in Ann Arbor Michigan. Morcilla Tapas is overpriced and paying $5.99 for a tiny cafe flan that did not have anything special was too much. Coffee at $2.75 per a cup, only because it's from Spain? Oh well... I am still thinking that $70.00 for two people was too much. And not really marvelous service, but on top of that I added a 15% gratuity. I will never come back.

Do NOT waste your time going here. I found it on a map, so we went and was really surprised to find it's a tiny nook in a convenient store and NOT an Italian restaurant at all. We ended up getting food anyway out of convenience, but it was bad and tasted like it been sitting all day.

We were given a fixed price as a group of 20 - only to find out that they put a so called 'service charge' on top of the price they gave us. Beware of that! They can con you! Also the portions are small and the prices are expensive. Not recommended as there are much better places for cheaper prices...
Simple, if you want good prices on dry goods go there. If your looking for live stock go somewhere else.
Man, Chipotle is delicious, but take one look at the nutritional facts and you'll see why you should make it a "treat" instead of an every day meal. The burrito alone has 300 calories... and there's enough sodium in anything on the menu for an entire day. They may say "Fast but not fast food", but it is fast food; shoot, they're owned by McDonalds...
My wife and I, usually will go to This Denny's Restaurant In Sawmill Drive in West haven Conneticut on sunday mornings...however, we visited a couple of times in the afternoon and the services ws a lot more to desired. The waitress never got the service at the table like before. We had to asked for utensils and compliments items like sugar and others. She kept forgetting things and I had to borrow from the next table. She never came by to ask if everything was ok. Another day we went and ask for coffee and cream( this time a different waitress) and she never brought the cream and we had to ask several times to another waitress. The floor is very dirty carpet should be replaced. Will try a different restaurant for now on.
I used to eat Chipotle a lot, but it was never a great place to go for me, and was really only tolerable. I would usually only go when a big group of us went. One day, however, I discovered Qdoba, and I haven't been able to eat Chipotle since. I finally discovered good food at Qdoba, and I couldn't tolerate the cardboard tortillas, plastic chicken, dirt beef, or Styrofoam chips from Chipotle any more. As a company, they do some neat things, like canned food drives and sustainable, cruelty-free ranching, but it doesn't make the final product any better, and they have a very limited selection of food options as well. I know a lot of people who love Chipotle and hate Qdoba, but those same people also love to eat glass, so I don't put much faith in their taste buds. My recommendation: try it once, then try Qdoba once, and get the same thing at both places (so you'll be limited to a burrito, and you won't be able to try any of the other amazing products Qdoba has on top of that until later).

Have been here several times for HH and while the prices are not bad the food is just not that good. And don't expect good service especially on the patio our group sat with empty drinks for a while...
Crummy food and hillbilly decor...Nascar stuff *everywhere*. The servers are great though. If you want the servers to serve you crummy food quickly and efficiently, this is your place!

The dining room decor, silverware, dishes and glasses should be upgraded to match the quality of the food.
ماشاء الله اجمل المساجد
This place is passable....in terms of quality of fish, it's decent for the price, but their interpretation of some things makes me laugh. It's clear this place is meant for speed rather than taste, I ordered a Salmon Skin Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll and Tuna Roll. All 3 were ready to go in 5 minutes...unheard of for what I ordered. I got back to my office and settled in to dig in. I discovered the "Shrimp Tempura" is really Diced Shrimp with Tempura Flakes. Not hot fresh from the fryer. The Salmon Skin was prepared clearly earlier this day or the day before, and the Tuna was good quality overall. I likely will not go back, but if you want inexpensive sushi that will at least fill you up, feel free to go.
Good overall, overpriced for live crawfish though. They usually run about 25-50 cents higher than other places.
I am a local small business located in this beautiful city. I always keep my entertainment local wben possible. I have been to this location on 3 occasions. The food is always good along with their drinks. The last friday I went for happy hour and dinner I went to the restroom and advised the bar tender that I was not finished wbile I went to the bathroom. Upon returning to my outside table my dinner had been thrown away to clear the table because they were very busy. I have not returned because they did not offer to replace my dinner that I had eaten 2 bites of. I intented on contacting the manager because the staff is good but very young. I just started going somewhere else. Good food, beware if you intend on taking your food home, it might be gone when you return.
Personally I feel it more MEH than YEAH!

The staff was nice, but the property needs to be re-done and updated. The photos are deceiving and leads the viewer to believe they would be staying in a much nicer place. The toilet didn't flush, shower didn't have any water pressure and the floors were filthy. It is a "economy" motel and basically served as a place to sleep. If you don't expect much this is your place. If you expect a little more, avoid.

Great customer service but i"ve been here a couple of times already and have gotten a gel manicure and next day it started peeling off. I had to go back to get it redone. Another time I came and got a pedicure and same day the whole nail polish just chipped off and some others started chipping off as well. I went back the next day and they were giving me a hard time with redoing it, said they would charge me extra because it wasnt gel polish and that it's It's likely to chip off. This is like the 3rd time this has happened to me.

Sympa ! La fondue est très honnête, la charcuterie est quelconque, le vin est bon, le tout est assez cher mais globalement, j'ai passé une excellente soirée.
The good: Friendly staff and quick service. HUGE portions. BYOB. Large pieces of shrimp in the Pad Thai. The not so good: Not at all authentic or even particularly interesting - gave me cabbage, not bean sprouts, no peanuts, no tamarind, no lime. No alcohol at all unless you bring it yourself. And the prices are expensive - I got charged $6 to put some meat into my pad thai, which it didn't say on the menu. The bad: They don't' accommodate larger groups very well. They won't take reservations for them and they made us wait a half hour to be seated.

My boyfriend and I went here for dinner and we are not going back again. The waitress was unfriendly, she did not provide good service (she put my glass on top of the drink menu), the hushpuppies were fifteen mins late, and she did not come by one time to fill our glasses. The food was not worth the price. We spent over $60 for low-quality fried flounder and eight grilled scallops. We basically paid for the view of the marina. I left unsatisfied and upset about our experience.

This goodwill is excellent for women, young women, and girls looking for nice upscale clothing. However it is lacking in furniture and there are rarely young children's items. The one time I've seen any kind of children's items in this store it was a small basket of maybe 2 onesies and a bib and hat.

Would have loved to visit but found it far too expensive.
I stayed on the Queen Mary for a conference and it was a lot of fun. The food was pretty good at the places we ate, and the staff was very nice. The downside is that the coffee bar can't handle a large crowd, nor can the restaurants, so there were days when we didn't get a chance to eat because they could not accommodate the amount of people actually staying on the ship.

Bland clam chowder - they should stop using skimmed milk and use the real thing. Chicken Marsala is to be avoided. The chicken was so tough that when trying to cut it with a knife I moved the table. My wife's shrimp must have been delivered three weeks ago. The waiter charged us for two bottles of wine when only one was ordered.

"" The food is nothing to brag about! I feel they need to work on it, I ordered pork fried rice, chicken and pork eggroll twice and have yet to been satisfied. Everything is cook too long because it's hard and dry. I will not eat here a third time around. I will stick with Tops China in Savannah off Skidaway I've been eating them for over 4 years and have yet to be disappointed.""
A rewarding experience. However, considering the long distances that had to be traveled while exploring the four-story facility it would have been helpful if the management provided better accommodations for handicapped and mobility impaired patrons.
Service work is expensive. $110 for a tire rod? At auto zone the part was $15. I came in for a routine oil change for $30. After the oil change they performed a curiosity check. They give me a list of problems with total over $800. The tire rod was the most expensive but I found it cheaper at auto zone. Did some research on YouTube, and I personally repaired 3/4 issues with my Enlantra for under $150!

We stopped in here with the family for a quick bite while traveling through on I-64 last weekend to eat and let our 2 year old stretch his legs in the playroom. This was by far the dirtiest McDonald's I have seen. Every table in the resturant seemed to be dirty, the trash cans were full. The floor behind the counter was an absolute mess. Flys were buzzing about and the staff was not friendly. The play room equipment while in good shape needed to be cleaned. Needless to say I've ate in "greasy spoons" before that were much cleaner than this place. Do youself a favor and avoid this MCDs.
Good society.. lots of apartments, lot of international cultural people. The main problem is we dont get parking for vechicles at night times
If I could title this review, it would be called "It's about the little things." Overall, the resort is beautifully maintained and has a number of very fine amenities for their guests. The staff was, in most instances, very courteous and helpful. But my wife and I went there to escape our normal realities and, even though we were not far from home, leave behind the world for a time. But unfortunately, the little things can matter a great deal in those situations. Little things like the menu at Pub 46 being changed, even though the website has not been (my wife wanted to go there for a specific dish). Or the "On the Potomac" restaurant being closed, even though all of the room materials state otherwise. That the phone did not work properly. That we had to call multiple times for several items to be brought up. That the bed required all of the extra pillows in the room, and an extra blanket, to provide sufficient comfort for sleeping. That, at Stonewall's Tavern, I ordered a rather expensive steak and was not offered a steak knife or steak sauce until my steak was nearly completed. I could go on, but you get the idea. My point is that while I am sure, to some, this will appear to be a series of minor complaints, each one gnaws at the relaxed illusion that vacationers and those looking to rest (particularly parents who get a weekend away from their kids) are looking to create until they add up to something that forces you to face the reality of the situation and remember that all of the imperfections of your normal life are never that far behind you.
I took my wife here for dinner on a date because I heard good things about this place. However, I did no expect the level of service to be so "casual". It is deli style ordering with sit down prices. The food was good, fresh, and tasty, but the service was very lacking for the price. I was expecting a nice little sit down, take your order and the table type service, but I got fastfood style instead.
Worse food
Was not impressed with the fettucini alfredo; very dry and not a lot of sauce. They forgot the hummus the first time and I had to go back for it.
I normally dont post bad reviews, but I posted on their facebook wall and they deleted the post. so I wanted to share the word about the horrible service I received there today. I have NEVER been treated like this before! So my wife and I found this place by doing a search on my phone after the "Bachelor Farmer" told us we had an hour wait today for brunch. We were very hungry and when we arrived, we were quickly seated (awesome there). The menu looked amazing given the prices. My wife ordered a brunch burger (with a fried egg on it) and I ordered this egg in a bowl pastry thing. The kitchen brought out our food initially, and the egg was only partially cooked. (sunny side up, runny whites). We can understand that since it was our first time, we didnt know how they prepared their eggs. So the waiter brought her plate back to fix it. They cooked the same egg a little more and put it back on the burger. Which meant that there was still runny whites left on the burger. My wife hesitantly bit into the burger and noticed that the burger was only partially cooked and was cold pink in the middle. She was then disgusted and sent it back and did not want to eat her meal. I did not eat my meal, and at that time I told the waiter we just wanted to pay for what we had already consumed (a scone, orange juice and a tea and leave) he brought the bill and it still had my plate on it. He said since he offered to fix it for my wife that I was on the hook for my plate (even though he promptly removed it and i did not eat it). Hang on here...we are getting to the best part. So I hesitantly paid... On our way out the manager called me over (he never had the courage to come address me at the table while I was still there), by waiving a gift certificate at me. I told him the whole story and why it was not fair that I had to pay for food I did not eat. His response was "Well its good that you are never coming back, because you are not welcome here" I have never been told that by someone before so I was shocked...I have been nothing but respectable to the people there, and I will be honest that I got really upset and told the manager to F- off on my way out the door ... they mocked me on my way out by telling me loudly and obnoxiously to "have a good day". Unacceptable
It's cheap pizza, not that good, not that bad. The Italian Cheese Bread is a must though, but as for the actual pizza... You would be better just to spend some money elsewhere for higher quality. Even so, cheap is cheap, and the butter and parm makes it really good.
Loved the self guided tour which let you wander around at your own pace and our dogs were welcome too! Also appreciated that they remained open late...after a long drive from Cheyenne and checking into our campground, a leisurely walk around this quaint replica of the old west was just what we needed before dinner.

Its no longer open on Sundays, just Mon-Fri 8-5. But it is located in the Westin on the second floor at the business services area and I was able to walk in and use the printer to print items I needed for business on Monday morning. Double sided, full color, loaded my own paper and had exactly what I needed. A bit pricey, but it was far better than no option at all.
As others costumers , also had bad "experiences" at Bayside! But I decided to give a try once more to celebrate my Birthday , yesterday 23 January. However I need to share that Erick, our waitress was so kind, so professional ,that make my birthday and my guests happy! I think Bayside, need more good workers as Erick! The girls that work there , look like they are making you a "favor"! Erick you are and was a plus to my party! Thanks so much!Any good sport bar or restaurante will be glad to have your service! God Bless you! Marisa Sarmento Edwards
If this place wasn't directly across from my office, I wouldn't go as much as I do. They are usually understaffed and I can end up waiting 15 minutes for a bagel and coffee. The two computer checkout system they have is bogus. If it had any benefit, Starbucks would be using it. All of that being said, food is good, clean environment.
Un sitio de encuentro, agradable ambiente y una esmerada atención, lo recomiendo para reuniones de negocio o tertulia.

Really attractive restaurant, but the food was overpriced and under-flavored.
The best thing this restaurant has going is the location and building; otherwise, it's just not worth the high prices. The drinks are usually very good and decently priced, and perhaps that serves to dull the sting of the over-priced, bland, too-cheesy food. I knew I was in trouble when everything I received had a huge tortilla chip garnish stuck in it, like a sad flag of tex-mex defeat. If you order guacamole, expect to find lettuce packed at the bottom. A bowl of over-salted queso is $8. By all means, go celebrate with friends here, but I'd recommend sticking to the chips and salsa if you don't want to feel cheated (and go home with a bellyache). Service is average, worse when busy. The last time I visited, it took almost 25 minutes for the waiter to bring the check, return, and run my card. It was a Thursday night.

Victory Bar does not take American Express for payment. We had a pretty nice experience at the bar with food, drink, and ambiance but not being able to pay with my credit card put a sour tone on the night.
Probably won't go back. Service was incredibly poor. Waitress forgot appetizer and then plopped it down when we were half way through our meal. She took our order and placed 2 dirty dishes of food on our table when she took it. A different waitress deemed it necessary to get on her knees at each booth to take an order. Food was ok but the waitresses have absolutely NO training and apparently no common sense.

Because it is in Terminal D but outside security, this is a fine place for those from outside DFW to await arrivals or visit with travelers during a long layover. Food is tasty is a bit overpriced. It is currently in the midst of renovation, so seating is limited, carpets are stained, upholstery is frayed and restrooms are less accessible — for now.
They would disable your room access just to tell you that you need to pay a certain amount of money for stays longer than 5 days ! Otherwise it is clean and comfortable. The are very few options on breakfast buffet. Good price as well
The food is good, but be prepared to wait a long time for your food!

This is the second time I tried tropical for lunch and was disappointed. The first time I receive about a half ounce of chicken in my flatbread sandwich. The second time I ordered the Wasabi Roast Beef on the Ciabatta bread. This is false advertising as the “Ciabatta” was nothing more than a puffed up version of their flat bread, nothing more than a mushy tasteless roll. Real Ciabatta bread has a crisp crust, a somewhat soft, porous texture. For something with Wasabi in the name it was amazingly bland. I understand the smoothies are good, I don’t recommend the sandwiches.
Tutto molto ben curato. Strutture, piste, snowpark ben tenuti e di ottimo livello. Unica nota negativa i prezzi per gli impianti di risalita.42€ per uno skipass giornaliero son un po' troppi, tenendo conto che il Mottolino si trova in zona extradoganale (esentasse), dovrebbe avere costi di gestione contenuti, e quindi prezzi più bassi.. invece ne approfittano

Waiting on a lawn mower that was getting their basic tune up package. It has been in for two weeks, with a max finish date of 5-17. Called to see what was up with it and it has not even been looked at yet...simple oil change and filter and blade sharpening. Gonna spend as much having somebody mow my lawn in this amount of time that I am on the repair. Not happy, probably won't use Sears again.
Do remember that do not take any bag or cellphone there. You will be asked to store those things in a 200m away convenient store, which I kinda hate.
The service was rather sub-par, but the staff were willing, helpful, and generally nice people. Food was nice.
Terrible service. long long wait, servers everywhere but no one stopping to see if we needed anything. never visiting there again.

Consistently the worst fast food service in town. It seems that the teenagers that can't hack it at McDonalds or Wendys get jobs here. Only reason to go here is if you are really craving a pretty good Reuben...and some attitude from a teenager who is upset you interupted their social time for their job.
Very dirty ...ROACHES EVERYWHERE DRUGS,PROSTITUTION,DRUNKS!! NOT A PLACE FOR KIDS
Arrived 20 min before checkin time and was told our room was not ready and would have to wait. While waiting observed 3 other patrons arrive and recieve there keys and go to there rooms? Now why did we have to wait??? Why didnt we get that room and they wait we were there first. Preassigned rooms would be my guess. Not good bad service.

The rooms are modern and comfortable, everything is very clean. However, breakfast is outrageously expensive. Of course, you will always check prices first, and we simply ate in a bistro next door. However, 18 € for an ordinary breakfast buffet is sheer impudence, and I rather look for hospitality.

Usually the service is pretty decent but the last time I went the service was bad. I ordered the lunch special because I wanted takeout they decided I could not have the soup. I asked was it the same price and they told me yes. When I asked to see a manager, I got a lot of disgusted faces and rude excuses. I love hibachi and loved the proximity to my home but as a person who routinely spends 50+ for 2 ppl. I'd rather go somewhere my patronage is appreciated.

It was my first visit and unfortunately I will not be returning. Our waitress, Lizeth, was great, but our chef on the other hand, was not. He overcooked all of our meats (chicken and shrimp) and gave us the wrong type of steak when it should have been given to the other party; we got filet and they had ribeye but he gave us the ribeye. Another party asked if their steak was cooked medium rare because it looked well done, but the chef said it was. The filet was actually good once we got it, but the chicken and shrimp for me was way overcooked. The service also took way too long to cook all of the food by far. The rice and noodles were good, but by the time we got our meat, everything else was stone cold because it took the chef so long to cook everything. I love hibachi, but I will be going somewhere else next time to actually enjoy it.
This was my first time at Cultiva. It is decorated nicely and I felt comfortable when I first walked in. I ordered a cup of the Dark Roast coffee and it came to me cold. When I complained to the staff they seemed not to care and told me that seemed unfortunate. There was no offer to replace the cup that I had with a hot cup of coffee. The music was obnoxious and way to loud making it difficult for us to have any type of meaningful conversation without shouting. Again, our request to reduce the volume of the music was ignored. The staff didn't seem to care for the music as they had their ipods on with their earbuds in their ears listening to their own music. The fan overhead on a cool June day was going at mach 1 speed causing a cool breeze to wash over us and making our beverages even colder than they were. If you want a nice relaxing place to have a hot cup of coffee and a conversation with friends, this is not the place to go. I will not return.

Es un buen hospital no lo niego pero he quedado muy triste, después de dar un par de vueltas y realizarme los estudios que pidieron, la doctora muy novata por cierto y su supervisor determinaron que mi problema de miomas no es tan urgente y me han aplazado mi próxima consulta hasta dentro de dos meses, mi estómago está muy abultado y sigo sangrando ¿cuánto se supone que voy a esperar? La recepción es buena y la promesa de dar solución inmediata da esperanza, pero ya una vez adentro es grande la decepción.

Positive notes: the place is clean and generally comfortable. The staff seem to be working very hard to make sure things are taken care of and pleasant. They have many discounts and coupons for the adjacent casino and shows. Negative notes: We were put in a room with an awful view and awoken at 4am to noise from a steam roller resurfacing the asphalt on the road outside the room. Refrigerator ice maker is broken along with other amenities. Considering how far in advance that we arranged this trip, I'm very upset about the room location. There is also an undertone throughout of sales for the timeshare which I don't care for.
I have stayed at numerous Residence Inns over the years. This particular place really needs an upgrade. The other Marriott Residence Inns across the country have been updated in regards to the televisions in the rooms, the lobby, suites in general ie.. furniture and bedding, and the lighting throughout. Still a decent place to stay and the value is great.

Pros: Good food Cons: Never got a refill on our water even though one glass was empty Dishes and silverware did not look clean. We did send back a spoon that should have never been used. The rest looked like they use a cheap dishwashing detergent that left water spots. Overall, while the food was good, it didn't overcome the rest of the experience.There is better asian food all around.
I came here for my first (and ONLY) time last week, and I must say they have a mediocre selection of decent beer......... BUT the prices are comparable, if not better, most other places that have craft beers. I will say though, the customer service my girlfriend and I received would be the only positive reason for returning.... although that does only go for the employees. I honestly have never in my life felt as weird and creeped out, as I did from the "owner". (Reason I quotation it, is because NO owner should feel it okay to conduct himself the way this one did!) As we arrived, we were greeted with awesome smiles and hello's. We definitely felt like it was a comfortable and warm environment, but that was only until we had a few sips of our ciders we ordered... about 45 seconds into them we were greeted by an individual named Steve, I believe, who I later found out was the owner. He started off very personable and nice it seemed, but in the next few visits he seemed to attempt to warm up to us (i.e. putting his hand on our shoulders, and complimenting on our looks). At first we were a bit weirded out, until we observed him inside siting at a table drinking what clearly looked like beer (which I believe is illegal?) . After that, we were a bit suspicious of the entire establishment. He continued to go around and talk to other customers, and it seemed as though he would be especially close and warm to women. We were VERY reluctant when another employee would be at our table, before the owner had a chance to stop. Needless to say, we are very indifferent on returning to the Hoppy, and I do apologize... but if we do return, it will only be made if the owner is not present. So if any ladies are reading this, and are planning to have a relaxing drink outing, try and bring a man with you!
My husband and I went yesterday to buy guitar strings and picks. There were not many people in the store, it was close to closing time, and as soon as we came in we were attended. We did not have a chance to browse or walk around the store. After our purchase, the sales clerk directed us to the lady by the door to check out. She took everything out of the bag and took like 5 minutes to check that the items on the receipt were the items we paid for. It made me extremely uncomfortable and I felt like I was treated like a thief. While she was there, why not include a freaking pat down. If the clerk put the items in the bag himself, there was no need for such an extreme order purchase verification. Next time, I will tell my husband to buy the items he needs for his guitar online through another retailer. I don't need to feel like the TSA is in a guitar store. Seriously...
Good food for such a small town. I'm pretty sure they have the same crawfish sauce that they put on every single meal. If you like that kind of sauce, it is delicious! But they put it literally on every single dish that they have. They're grilled chicken house salad was good.
Tea Talk is a small drinks place that you can go to for cheap freshly made drinks. I gave it a 0 for food because the place doesn't sell food. The decor was simple and bright creating a positive atmosphere in the shot. Nonetheless, it wasn't something fancy that required a lot of work. The workers there tried their best to attend every customer's need because the place is usually packed with customers. It's good service. I tried asking for one of the workers' phone number and she did not give it to me because it was against her work's policy. So the place definitely hire capable people to work there. If you're in Chinatown and looking for a place to cool off, then this is the place. Although there was a sign at the window that said FREE WIFI, when I went inside, my friend tried to use the WIFI but it was locked. Weird.

I read the first two reviews on this page prior to going into Ackerson. The office was nice and they were helpful but very sales oriented. I felt like I was at a car dealership getting pushed to add on all the bonus features because "I needed them." I decided to go elsewhere after seeing the price they quoted me.
The store part was nice. If you are a truck driver like myself you might want to pass on taking a shower here. You get a half of a drying towel no face towel and they want to hold onto your credit/debit card if you don't have cash. Normally that wouldn't be a problem if they put it in the register but the lady just sat it out in plain sight so anybody could just walk up and swipe it. I asked ifshe could take my drivers license instead she said no so I took my card back and went to the atm and took cash off. You would think with all the identity thefts places would be more mindful of how they handle your information.
As far as parks in Shanghai go, this one is basic. There are plenty of benches for sitting and great coverage with trees for lots of shady spots. There are 2 full-court, basketball court and a 1/2 (0.5) kilometer track for walking or jogging. An incredible number of street vendors and restaurants, of all sizes, border the park on 3 sides. The 4th side is the problem and that is the high-volume, trunk road, known as Yan'an Road East. Constant traffic noise, at high volume, plus the pollution that comes with it make this less than an idea place to relax or exercise. Combine this with the large population which always seems to be present, in the park and on the move I'd recommend other places to hang out in for a quiet morning, afternoon or evening. But if you just need to pass through for a bit of green in your daily working day this is a place you can enjoy for a short stroll.

I ordered `lamb shank pie` @ £13.50 when brought to the table it had a lamb bone sticking out through the mash potato topping. I pulled the bone, it came out and it had no meat on it. I decided then not to eat it but to have a look at what was in there first. The bowl was topped off with 75% mash the rest of the bowl was advertised as `lamb cooked in a red wine sauce` (6 small bits of lamb). There was hardly no sauce in there and it was not cooked any where near red wine (i tasted a small piece). I asked for some red wine sauce but all that was brought back was a small drop of gravy!. At that point the meal was sent back and i left hungry. :-( My point is £13.50 for a meal that would have cost approx £4 or less from `Brakes the wholesaler`. Not happy.

I went here with family and friends. Good property. Specious. Out of city. They are lacking in staff. Poor service. For every problem you mention, they have standard answer 'sir we do not have enough staff'. After we had hot discussion on first day with management, we started getting room service and water served on restaurant table. Very limited choice in menu and drink. I will not visit this place again.
Everytime i have a drive through the food is always cold... I have to request it to be cooked fresh to ensure its hot.
Service was slow but adequate. They try and play off as if they know technology but their ignorance shines through.

My wife and I have been eating at this place for about a yr. And a half, it seemed to be one of the best sushi places around mesa. About 4 days ago, we went with a japanese friend who lives in Mexico, and the waitress make me look as a jerk who doesn't know anything about japanese culture, just because I couldn't give a Japanese pronunciation while saying Mochi ice cream, besides a not very polite service, even though, we left about 13% tip; two days later, we give a second chance, and it was very busy, we had se waitress, Lindsay, she forgot our drinks, (chef concern) brought a very bad taste salad, put avocado on a sushi that shouldn't have, and my friend doesn't like it either, besides, she charged regular price at a happy hr, and adjudicated a 16% tip without saying anything, and we were only 3 adults, and my 4 yr old daughter. So this is it, that was my last time there, now will go back to the awesome ichi ban at 99 ave, or will look for some good place around Gilbert/Mesa.. I was very sad. Also scalops make me sick...:(
I am staying there last one day and looking ok.
Good value Tapas, self service, so easy to drop in for a quick bite. If you're looking for a place for a casual meal, in more of a bar setting, then this is perfect.
Disappointing lunch at the Ale House this past week. Of the most important components of business, People, are your number one asset. Your employees and most important are your customers. A few of my notes from our lunch time visit. We arrived and were quickly seated at 11:45. Of the 8 in my party, 1 wanted to order the wings, we'll he couldn't because the "rub" had just been placed on them and it would be 30 min before ready to cook. (not good, should've had rub on by 10:30, since they open at 11 for lunch). Next another person wanted their burger medium rare, they were told they could not cook it to medium rare. I order a Burger and it came out "medium rare" and the other person had a medium well...what is going on?? Before we order, we had been there about 5 minutes and I asked the waitress if the music could be turned down some, I could not hear the person that was directly across the table from me. They said they did, but it was still loud. I asked a manager and she said she did not have control of the stereo system and it could not be adjusted since it was programmed in. Unfortunately, she is right, but lunch time is used for business meetings...catching up with friends or saying good by to friends...not holding a beer feast... The music can be re-programmed and controlled better if they desire. I couldn't tell you the managers name since she wasn't wearing a name tag and she never introduced herself. I don't see going back there. And in the short time they have been open, they have just as many negative comments as they do positive. And I'm not sure if these post are even monitored or replied to by the management or owner. If you want to express your positive or negative experience with this location, I suggest you send it to the owner. Lou Moshakos at 6510 chapel hill rd Raleigh, NC 27606. He owns several of Ale house restaurants and I'm sure he wants to hear your comments.

Friends and I ate at this place last night and have on a few occasions. They have great food but the waiter that we seem to get every time we go in is horrible. He gives us our food and NEVER returns to the table. Not even to give us our bill. That's just the start of the problem. I can deal with bad service by not tipping well. However, after last night I will never return. We got our bill after asking for it and the numbers didn't seem right so I added everything up. it was 3.00 off. we asked about it and he openly told us that he added it on because we didn't tip last time we were in there which was well over a month ago. He said he doesn't work for free and works for tips. We told him he had better customer service he would get better tips. I am one that will leave 10-20 dollar tips if I feel it is deserved. But when my drink is never refilled and u never see ur waiter again it isn't deserved. Like I said tho I will NEVER go back to this place because of this which sux because they have great food!

Tires did not get reset to correct location after tire rotation. Engine Oil Life Monitor did not get reset after service. All our setting on Radio were messed with. Clothes we had hanging in the back were on the floor. Wasnt very impressed with the care taken to complete the service and take care of our vehicle.
This is a great coffee place of all time.Great for all workers or those on a budget! It's worth coming back again with friends, especially with those who are in London for the first time. Love it!
Bottom line... I've seen worse and paid more. I'd come back.

This is authentic South Indian food and some of the dishes can be really spicy if not ordered carefully. Masala dosa is very good here. The sambar is as spicy and tasty as it should be. I was a regular customer to this place until I ordered a a 4 dosa plate. The owners gave me a ridiculously small proportion of sambar to go with it although I asked for more at the start. In the end he blind sided me by notifying that extra sambar would cost me extra. At that point I was in no position to argue because I did not have anything eat the dosa with. So, beware of the cheap mentality of the people running this place. This is only a small start up and they have not yet got their policies right. The place is only large enough to fit around 10 people.

Happy to have my iPhone screen fixed in 45 minutes after smashing it on a sunday late afternoon. Not so happy to find that it now had many problems. Constantly rebooted itself, battery did not read correct levels and was barely able to function because of the rebooting. Sent it with repair... after 2 1/2 weeks almost they sent it back saying that i would have to restore to factory settings because a recent upgrade was most likely the problem. They also said that they would let me restore settings so i could back up all the contents. Turned on the phone today to find that all my photos, apps and contacts had already been deleted. Also found that problem STILL happened after resetting through phone. Now having to go through a three hour process on iTunes which i'm not even sure will fix it..... Very sad...
I was so excited to find Gluten Free Pizza, I had a coupon to buy one take out gluten free pizza and get one to bake later.

I'm a regular at this hm and it has its ups and downs. It is constantly packed, even in the early hours and the registers always go so slow! However, you can always find something to wear and they have a great variety. A lot of the staff is rude, but there are a few comical ones that definitely perk you up and make you chuckle. I, pretty much, only come back for the great prices.
Serves the local community with affordable shops, it's not a tourist attraction, unless you want some authentic Columbian doughnuts and coffee, it's out the back if you do - through the train station. Ignore calls for regeneration they'll only ruin it for locals.

The food is terrible. Great place to go for a movie but if you are wanting to eat there....don't.
Stale bread. Tasteless food. Poor service. Generally bad experience. I would not recommend it to anyone.
Service was horrible, I went two different days of the week and the service was slow. It took them 45 minutes to get 4 tacos to go on a slow day. Second time was with 7 family members. The waitress couldn't even remember to bring out all the food or bring silverware after an hour and 15 minutes of waiting to get our breakfast.
Previous reviewers are a little harsh, and must have a bone to pick. I've been to this McDonald's more often than any other, and I rarely experience any problems. "Food" and "Decor" categories are worthless here... it's exactly the same food and decor as pretty much every McDonald's. Service is usually fine. I've had a few "not-so-fast" experiences, but they've never messed up my order once, I've always been waited on in the correct order when waiting in line at the counter, and I usually get my order within 3 minutes of ordering at the counter or drive-thru box (and yes, I often actually time it).
Don't order food: it was served cold.
I just ordered an Italian beef and its gross. I hate the way it smells and the way it taste. Whatever season they used on it sucks plus the texture of the meat is off. But the ribs are great catfish too. But they need to hire someone else to answer the phone cause dude is rude as hell, no exactly what you want b4 you call cause he will hang up on you. Plus don't ask to many question.

Got a free stay here complimentary from Winstar Casino. It was an alright hotel. It was clean and they give you free breakfast. The service though could use a little work. First, I come in late from the casino and get all snuggled up in bed to find out my batteries were dead on my remote. I called the front desk and the guy told me I would have to come down there with my remote but he wasn't sure he even had batteries. I told him the kind of batteries I needed and asked him to let me know if he had some. He then waited about 30 mins and showed up with the wrong batteries. He then told me he couldn't get me another remote or batteries but would let me know if he finds some before I check out. Being a customer service freak, I would have pulled batteries out of a remote from an unoccupied room instead of telling my customer no. So breakfast comes around and I go to make me a waffle. I turn the button on and pour my batter in and this lady worker comes over, turns my waffle maker off, and starts wiping out my batter. She says "This one is broken. You should have used the other one" How was I suppose to know. There was no sign and the machine looked like it was working just fine. I think she was trying to clean breakfast up early and I was messing up her progress. Those to employees and the slowest elevator on the planet is what makes me glad I stayed on Winstar's Tab because I would have really been upset if I had paid for it.
Considering that there is alot a pasta places in the local area to choose from, I am finding that the general quality of their food dishes is only of average quality - doesn't quite reach the hype of their marketing campaign.

The Hotel Ballina is situated just off the N26, outside of Ballina town. The rooms are clean and well appointed, the food and facilities are good. However those guests at the back of the hotel will have to suffer the noise of air conditioners from the attached leisure centre. The hotel also suffered a severe lack of towels during our stay.
