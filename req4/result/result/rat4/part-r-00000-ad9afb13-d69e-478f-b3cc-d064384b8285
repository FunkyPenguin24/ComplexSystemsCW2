So unprofessionell ist die Berliner Nespresso Boutique - hier sind an einem Samstag zur Hauptgeschäftszeit die Mitarbeiter damit beschäftigt, die Regale aufzufüllen. Kenne ich nur von REWE nach 20h, da kostet der Kaffee aber nicht 60 Euro/kg. Aber wir wissen ja, wie schwierig es ist, in Berlin professionelle Mitarbeiter zu bekommen :)

Was hesitant at first as Essential Beauty salons have had a bad rep at some of their locations. However, I gave it a chance and was pleasantly surprised. This store just opened 3 weeks ago.Great if you live locally and just want a cheap and convenient place to go for your usual beauty maintenance i.e. waxing. Therapist are mature and professional. I plan on coming back again :)

I've going to Cafe Shane for years and my experience just gets worse every time. The food is good but my last visit I waited almost 30 minutes after I sat down for anyone to walk over and acknowledge we've been sitting there. No water, no beverage just sitting there patiently waiting. I see one of the gentleman walk right past and give a couple waiting on line something to drink. I was appalled at this and eventually I said something. No sorry for the wait, no nothing. I ordered my food then waited almost an additional 40 minutes for this guy to even comes close enough for me to ask for another water. I had to ask to pay my bill before I walked out. Still no apology from anyone except the waitress who I met before but was not serving me that day. The time before that there was another waitress who took our order then forgot to put in one of the orders then asked if we still wanted it. Are you kidding me? As much as I love the food, that was probably my last time there.
Not bad at all

Great no frills Thai food. This can get busy during lunch so I recommend off hours. Their pad se eew with seafood is delicious
Affordable, customizable, large variety, service was good, attentive. Lots of healthy choices.
I ate here a couple time but I won't again...wayyy too pricey
god burger og cafe mad , lækker brunch og billig . spiser der often
Delicious food but loud background music
This is the best place for fried fish fare in all of Louisville, without a doubt. I love, too, that they serve beignets throughout the week ... I'm addicted!

Staff mentioned their hotel is still family run, and they make sure to treat you as one of their own. My friend and I woke up 1 hr past breakfast, and the staff still made us biscuits & gravy, waffles, and served us coffee. A big thanks to them for such a personal and hospitable stay!
They have menu in English and big choice of dishes. Really cheap place which we like a lot. Fast service.
Great place for a drink or two. Luv it!
Reliable, efficient and very competitive on price, proplumb are the only company I use for my various properties. As a landlord they really do take the stress out of repairs and fittings. Thanks

I just moved to Cambridge, and a friend and I were looking for a place to hang out Friday night. Point Break was great! The bartender was extremely nice, and kept drinks coming all night. He let us sample a few different drinks without charging us for them. The other people at the bar were nice as well. We had a few too many (as happens when you're having a great time), and the bartender actually arranged for someone to drive us (and my car) home instead of us having to take a cab and collect my car the following morning. I cannot recommend Point Break highly enough!

Always liked Jos A and a very convenient downtown location if you live/work down there
Had the Ghost burger, extremely good and the fried mushrooms were just awesome. The only complaint i had was the waitress forgot my milkshake at first. this wouldn't have been a big issue but that burger was damn hot and i needed it!

We discovered Dot's on a recent ride down RT 32S. Just as we were telling one another how hungry we were, we passed by this sweet little home/cafe with an OPEN flag flying in the breeze. We weren't really sure what to expect but we certainly weren't prepared for the warm welcome given to us by Dot and her husband. We had walked straight into an old country kitchen, complete with woodstove and cast iron pots and pans hanging on the wall. It was difficult to concentrate on ordering an actual meal when we were surrounded by all manner of homemade baked goods! My breakfast sandwich consisted of a big fluffy biscuit, sausage, cheese and an egg perfectly done, along with crispy home-fries, the kind with onions. Yum. We spent the most delightful hour or so chatting with this fabulous couple who so obviously have put their hearts and souls into the place. Since I'm Miss Curious and peppered them with questions, they were willing to share what their days are like, how they got their start; we even swapped grandparent stories! I felt like I'd just spent special time with family and even got teary when I gave Dot a big hug and said good-bye. Loaded down with blueberry muffins, donuts, and cinnamon buns, we reluctantly went on our way, but we'll be back. Oh yes, we'll be back soon!
The drive-through is always quick and I haven't had a problem in over 20+ visits.
The Service Adviser was very friendly and helpful. I was able to get an appointment at the last minute without having to wait. The Service Technician called me personally to explain the situation with my repair and went out of his way to get the manager's approval for service, that was otherwise may not have been covered under warranty. I would have given Excellent Reviews had the original problem been fully resolved. I will have to go back at a later time to address the same issue; but I am sure I will be treated cordially again. It may take a few diagnostics to fully get the problem solved so I can't say they are at fault. Overall, I am happy with the service.

I was intrigued by their sign advertising "Authentic Thai Street Food," which can be very difficult to find. I tried their roasted pork on rice, which is like Thai cow moo dang, and while it was not exactly like you might find in Thailand, it was the closest thing I've found on the east coast. The waitress was very friendly, and I will go back next time I'm craving that dish!
Very comfortable service and slept really well after the treatment!
Coming from South Africa we found that the accommodation at Quest Warrnambool was great. It was self-catering, spacious and well equipped. Great to have a washing machine and dryer as well iron and ironing board. All these home conveniences made travelling easy and enjoyable. And everything was in excellent condition, clean and neat.

Overall, the course was pretty awful tee to green from a fairway quality standpoint but that didn't matter at all. This course is for family fun and once on the greens they are in perfect shape. Kids had a blast and that's all that I care about. The pro shop was great and the driving range was perfect and I'm adding it to my list of weekend must dos.

This is one of our favorite shops in Haleiwa. I love all the original designs!! They're simply fabulous. Keep up the great work! My only bummer comment is that I'm not a twig, so I can't wear any of the girls shirts. But it doesn't keep me from supporting you! Peace!
Amazing
The food was not good at all. The decor is OK if you like this sort of thing. Waitress was very nice. I had the crabcakes and my wife had the crablegs. Her crablegs were skinny and there was not much meat in them at all. My crabcakes should have been called hamburger-helper cakes. There was so little crabmeat in them that they fell apart by themselves, so what came on my plate looked like a pile of crumbs. It tasted like that too. I had a glass of white wine: here is a hint: add some lemon juice to the cheap white wine.

First time there and was very satisfied with the food. It was very good. Will definitely return.

Recently we were in need of dietary help with our 8 year old rat terrier. I tried calling our veterinarian's office for advice and was directed to this store. Upon arriving I was shocked by the number of varieties of dog foods among the competing brands they stock. One of the young ladies who works there was most helpful and suggested I look at the protein content of each one, as to solve our dog's digestive issues a high protein formula was recommended by our vet. The one she helped me select was, while more than what I'm used to paying for dry dog food, one that was designed for sensitive stomachs and higher in protein. While a bit pricier than say a Wal-Mart or Target, they were both helpful and courteous. I would gladly suggest them to anyone.
Inspector was very thorough in his inspection of our home. He found things that needed attention that we hadn`t noticed and we were able to take care of them. I would definitely recommend him to anyone who wants a thorough inspection of their home.
I have been going to Bear Tooth since I was in middle school. For over 10 years I have greatly enjoyed the food and movies here. Over the past year though, both here and Moose's Tooth, the service has been getting worse. By worse, I mean douche-y. No matter the time of day, it seems that service is completely dependent on whether or not you are a friend of the employee. It is has become commonplace to have servers, staff, hostess, and ticket takers that are short, rude, snappish, and un-willing to be understanding to people who are hard of hearing. Recently I visited the Bear Tooth to see a movie with my husband, who is hard of hearing. He placed our food order by pointing on the menu. When our order came out during the movie, it was incorrect. That alone, is not a big deal, stuff happens, I use to be a server. I walked out of the movie to return the entree and politely asked for the correct entree to be sent out (a burrito instead of tacos). When presenting my receipt as proof of purchase, I was confronted by a young woman who proceeded to ask multiple questions in a confrontational manner about my order. When she located my ticket to match up with my receipt to prove that it was ordered, I was told rudely, "Fine, we'll take care of it" and was dismissed. I was still willing to forgive, it's busy and I had a great movie to go back and watch. Within five minutes my husband and I were rushed by a young man who started asking my husband (the same one who is hard of hearing) in a leading and defensive manner about our order again. Specifically, he was telling my husband that he ordered the tacos (which he did not, tacos and burritos are on two separate columns of the menu, which he pointed to). Keep in mind, this is during a loud, dark movie which we paid good money to see, that is crowded. So not only we were disturbed, the movie goers around us were disturbed also. Finally, the rude young man said "You ordered the tacos but that's fine, I'll change it for you." It seemed that the whole exchange was simply an outlet for this young man to rant at us and interrupt our movie, especially since I had already spoken to the woman earlier who was taking care of it. Just to be clear, there was NO price difference between the items, nor did I mind waiting (it was a three hour movie, I had plenty of time to wait). So all in all, yes the establishment has excellent food and usually great movies, but don't expect friendly or polite service. You'd be better off going anywhere else in Anchorage. I do want to mention one helpful and polite staff, the young woman working the ticket counter that day. She was incredibly helpful in explaining the reserve booth section and the upcoming concerts. Staff like that at Bear Tooth and Moose's Tooth need to be rewarded and interacting with the public more than their run-of-the-mill rude staff.

Mully's offers flavorful southern favorites both deep fried and baked. The buffet is sure to please. I enjoy the mac n cheese. All the fried meats are crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Food is full of flavor but not overpowered by seasonings. I even tried the stuffed crab and it was great. The lemonade must be fresh squeezed. It is some of the best lemonade I have had. The price of the dinner buffet is about $8.99 and is well worth it.

Competent, honest service department. Friendly, not overly pressuring sales team. I totaled my beloved 2007 FJ, originally purchased at Boulder Toyota in September of 2012. I called up the sales team at BT again and told them about my situation and my desire to find the same truck to replace it with. Within two days they had the exact same vehicle shipped in from another Larry H. Miller location in Colorado Springs. Important note -- If you are financing a vehicle, be sure to ask the sales team about getting GAP coverage. I am lucky that I paid the extra bit to have it on my first truck, it ended up saving me over $4500 net when my insurance payout didn't completely cover the outstanding balance of my loan. Think of it as a very worthwhile insurance policy against the value of your vehicle. Boulder Toyota has done all the scheduled maintenance on both of the trucks I've had, and I have never been anything but satisfied with their professionalism, scheduling flexibility, and quality of service.

A2Z Moving has done several moves for me, including a few small moves and a larger move more recently. I had two different crews on two different days for the most recent move. Both crews were professional, but the second crew was much more careful. The first crew wasn't as careful with my items. The other crew took a lot more time and were a lot more careful with how they moved things. On the administrative end, they're great. Bob, I don't know if he's the dispatcher or owner, he's awesome. That's why I've used them several times, I don't have to worry. I just call them once, and I know it's taken care of. To a potential customer, I would say, definitely use them. Just make sure you get the crew I had the second day to do it.
eaten here and carried out regularly. food very good; excellent service a welcomed bonus,
Provided us with excellent and prompt professional services for many years.

Pretty sure this place is not open on weekends.
I made my way here late late Sunday evening. There were three other tables being served and I was promptly greeted and seated. The staff provided good service and the food was delicious. I'd definitely pop in again.

This place is a great "hole in the wall" type. I go with my co-workers occasionally when the weather is good (lots of outdoor seating). The smoking pit is outside on the front porch next to the seating area, so you can frequently chat up the cooks while chowing down on the grub.
Arriba is most certainly NOT authentic Mexican food, but I love it! We have tried many dishes over the years and I have practically liked all of them, especially anything with their queso fundido. I have also been to 4 other locations across the Valley and this is by far the best one. I am definitely biased when it comes to service because I have a few waitresses that I request (Oneyda and Dulce.) There is also a female manager and a girl that bartends that are really nice too, but I can't remember their names.
A traditional pub with great beers & wines. Great prices on Sundays.

The authenticity is important. Almost everything we had was flavorful. Haven't had anything from hibachi but probably just as well. Way better than California rolling on my opinion
UPDATE: 5/25/2012 - I was told by a friend that this store had a change in Managment and that it had changed around a whole lot. So, I gave it another shot, I am pleased to say that 8 months after my first review, this BK has made some very good changes. New signage was very nice, but most importantly the people skills and food were MUCH better! Thanks and keep it up! This is by FAR the worst BK experience I hve ever had. It took 15 minutes to get to the counter with 3 people in front of us AT 3 in the afternoon!! The staff were no where near friendly or helpful. And my tray was handed to me with the frys all over it!! Horrible and slow, real lazy staff. There is a sign on the door that states that it is proudly owned and operated by bugerking corporation... Well, I will be honest, I would not be proud of that one!!!
Very nice with gud music n ambience......worth to be here.....
Not fancy but clean. Nice people at office.
This restaurant was very pricey but satisfactory. 3 people with entrees, drinks, and 1 dessert cost approximately $90. The restaurant is located well, close to the entrance to scenic attractions near the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The staff is very knowledgeable about their offerings and extremely polite. There is live piano music as entertainment that I enjoyed as well. The food was very well done and my parents couldn't find anything unsatisfactory to say about the restaurant (trust me, this is a first).
Its a honest and geniun place to work with all type of web based application and frameworks.i am satisfied and happy.
Great food and drinks. Shisha is excellent but the location is not the best
I love their clothes!!! They could make some improvements though...
Pesce fresco e molto ben cucinato! Niente primi e niente caffè ma...fa parte delle caratteristiche di La Balena. Ottimo rapporto qualità prezzo. Abbondanti antipasti, ottima frittura, frutta, vino della casa e acqua: € 21,00 sono un prezzo più che giusto.

One of my sons made a purchase from here and it was handled well. The store often has ammunition even when others do not. They have a good assortment of items. It is not laid out like a department store but it is a nice "hole in the wall" place to find and add to your list of possible suppliers.

A "sure thing" if you want a pleasant meal in WHB. Great steaks, burgers, seafood, salads, soups, light fare. You can't help but find something you like. The outside tables are great for people watching and the interior is intimate - kind of an "Americana" feel to it. Not fancy or ritzy - you'll be fine in khakis and a polo shirt. Recommended but you may have to wait for a table at rush hour. Get your name on the list early.
Nice place
Place is clean and prompt service.
Best Chinese Restaurant in Lakewood hands down.
Great food and service, fair pricing, decor is a throwback in time which is very cool! My girlfriend and I go there every 1st day of the month to celebrate our relationship!
I've been a member for about 4 months. I joined when they waived the $35 initiation fee so I pay $9.99 per month plus once a year they charge $39.99 (they say this fee ensures you lock in the $9.99/mo. rate - we shall see). Even with the unnecessary extra $40 fee, if you do the math, it's like $13.33/mo. Considering there are at least 15 treadmills, another 15-20 elliptical machines, and at least 8 stationary bikes, I never have to wait for a machine. There are weights too! A large back room full of free weights and weight benches for bench press, et cetera. There is also quite a good selection of universal weight machines. They debit your bank account each month for payment and you cannot sign up without your bank details. Although I didn't really appreciate the additional $40 fee, I have to admit this place has all the machines I like to use and I never have to wait for them. What more can you ask for?

I have always had superb food there. Dogs are not welcome in the restaurant area, but you can ask to eat in the bar area if you want to take your companion with you. There is also an outdoor area, ideal in the summer.
very good food! i think it's very expensive if you're not going during happy hour. service is friendly and fast. recommend it!
Next time i will stay here... huh
Good food and well priced but i don't rate the currys. It can prove difficult getting a reservation on either friday or saturday night, which means its usually packed. Try to get a table to the right of the bar to avoid passing the congested entrance when getting your food.

Excellent Pizza. It's really good and the service at the restaurant is top notch.
I've been here many times because I live down the street. People are right, the food is mediocre and way overpriced for quality EXCEPT for the nachos, they are really good! Also, the margaritas are good but you should opt for the more expensive ones. My favorite is the Hectorita made with 2 shots of tequilla and fresh squeezed lime juice served on the rocks in a tall glass for 11$. The atmosphere is very pleasant on the outdoor seating area on a sunny day. The service is also really good! They can get extremely busy on the weekends so you should be understanding if its slow.
Great food. Wonderful staff

I've brought my two Akita for examinations, vaccinations and experienced no problems at all. I made my appointments personally rather than by phone for the place seems to be always busy... "Dr. G" (Giangola) was very attentive and helpful and went out of his way to help me financially because I am a disable aging veteran with a fix income. Last year He performed a successful surgery removing one of the testes with a tumor on my 12 yrs old Yoroshii, (the oldest of the Akita). Because of my poor financial situation he allowed me to pick up my dog the next day and gave me specific instruction to help its convalescence. Because I get discounts at The Best Pet Rx Pharmacy, Dr. G wrote me all the needed prescriptions for me to take to the pharmacy...The Place is small and crowded so I walk my dogs instead of waiting and when my turn comes they had called me on my cell to start heading them back. Rhonda is grouchy but I think is the overwork and the small area full of people that want to get her attention all at the same time. I can only speak for my experiences during the very few occasions I had visit the place and cannot make assessments about what others had experienced. However all in all I think Dr. G has helped many and tries to help as many as he can thus the overcrowding. I also consider him an excellent Veterinarian.

Es el hotel mas bueno que fui todo es excelente lo malo que tuvimos problemitas con la habitaciones
Been wanting to go here for a long time, and finally went today. It was brilliant. The 'hot sauce' wasn't hot, but was very, VERY tasty. The food is cheap, and definitely Mexican, but also has many other things if you don't want Mexican.
Clean, quiet and within walking distance of pubs, clubs, cinemas, restaurants and massive shopping centres. Some issues with the shower and TV signal but some building work was going on at the time so I put it down to that being the cause. Make sure you go to the Ask Italian restaurant next to Cineworld, the food was absolutely incredible, service was exceptional and prices were fantastic.
Newly renovated rooms, expanded breakfast menu and hours, decent rates, new management, convenient location to airport - about a mile, fast internet - what else can you ask for?
Everyone had treated us very well
Good food and prompt service, but the place is dark and cold. Mood lighting is one thing, but this is a pub. Use the flashlight app on your smartphone to read the menu. Beautiful 25 ft cathedral ceiling and window wall makes it tough to heat the place in winter. Far too many patrons dining wearing their coats. Nice selection of beer.
Best CARNE ASADA TACOS in town!!! Love it Love it Love it

Really great. Helped me pick out what I needed (brake pads) and gave me advice about what else to watch for while I was replacing it. I don't know if they gave me a receipt, though, which made it hard to take the part back that I didn't end up needing.
Yummy humus
Very clean restroom and decent food selection. If your going North on the 12, great place to stop since there is nothing else!
Great little book store and coffee shop. The service can be a little on the slow side, but there's often only one person behind the counter. It's hard to warrant having a big, speedy staff in such a small town so I can't blame them for not being the fastest shop ever. BTW, the coffee and live music is terrific!
Their Butter Chicken is Great!
Hotel was great for some friends and I this weekend. Very nice. Very clean. Very modern looking. Front desk staff was nice, they gave us directions too most places as well as gave us some information about pre-game festivities before the NFL game. Very good prices here as well.
A little pricey for my taste and they don't have a lot of options on their menu. Other than that their food tastes really good and their service is okay.
Great place to walk to from the beach for quick breakfast or lunch. Better for morning coffee. Breakfast quesadilla was great.

Professional, friendly staff. Offered numerous auditions for highly paid work. Won several auditions. Made a lot of money. As in, 10 times the amount I paid for my photo shoot. Jobs sometimes take up to three months to be paid, as the process is, Rosey's clients wait until they are paid before they pay Rosey's. The talent gets paid last. We were told that at interview and during the one day training course. I found Rosey's was a great way to build confidence and experience. Rosey's has been a great pathway for me to get started in the industry. The work requires skill and a great attitude. If you don't have what you need, do consider part-time acting and presenter courses. This approach helped me ten-fold.
Great pizza...a little on the greasy side
Das Preisniveau liegt im gehobenen Segment, dafür erhält man jedoch auch gutes Essen, vernünftig zubereitet, saftiges Fleisch und es schmeckt frisch. Sehr gepflegtes Geschäft, sauber und übersichtlich gestaltet und vor allem eine freundliche Bedienung. Übermäßig viele Fernseher (20 Stück!!!) machen Euch (des unnötig hohen Energieverbauchs wegen) jedoch den 5. Stern zunichte.

Its been awhile since I've been to Limestone, and I won't be returning because of a horrible lunch service that occurred several years ago. My first mistake was that I purchased Limestone gift certificates for all my work staff for Christmas, and then in January we all went to use them for lunch. We had a sizable party so we were given a private room and table. As the server made the rounds pouring drinks he managed to pour an entire pitcher of tea down my back. I was drenched and made a b-line to bathroom to clean. Not only did the restaurant not attempt assist me in any way, or offer to clean my business attire, they didn't even discount the bill. To top that insult, as we left my party paid with their gift certificates, however their meal did not cost as much as the certificate was worth, but instead of getting some sort of credit or money back we were informed they were only good for one time use no matter how much was spent. . GET REAL!! After this experience I felt obligated to write Chef Gerhardt about my experience, not that I should expected anything, but never got a reply. The food I've had there is great, unfortunately I'll never return again

Theu do a great job with my blouses and dresses. just the right amount of starch in my husbands shirts. Very pleased.
Nice Place :)
We would not buy from any one else but this place!
Pizza molto buona. Prezzi però sopra la media.
Food tasted great the restaurant was clean. I like that it's local, small and next to other shops. the staff was courteous and service was quick. I Will return.
Real ales, derby brewing co. Very nice pint.
A good restaurant in the hert of suri..excellent quality of food with good service...you wont find another restaurant like this around suri....
Helpful and knowledgeable. Recently replaced a forced air furnace and installed ourselves, they were able to help answer the many questions we had.
Good ambiance. Good people around.Very good sound quality, Can take family which is otherwise difficult now-a-days-elsewhere.Visit the hall very frequently
I wish there was a way to do a half star as I would give Todd 4.5 stars. I googled Mac tech support and up popped his name. I called him, he came over got lots of info from me - many of my passwords - and off he went with ALL my equipment, iMac, keyboard, mouse, external hard drive and my iPad!! I said to myself - "I sure hope your intuition is correct that this is a trustworthy person, cuz otherwise he just made off with everything!" Well, my intuition certainly was correct. Not only did he do EVERYTHING he said he would do, in the amount of time he said it would take, but he brought it all back, set it up and I noticed he had even CLEANED my dirty keyboard!! Something I had been meaning to do for a while. Those little touches speak loudly. He then spent 2 hours with me - educating, me about the best ways to use my devices, and get the most out of the amazing way they all communicate with one another. Being someone who also works with people and loves my work what I appreciated most of all was how clearly he LOVES his work and his passion for all things APPLE is clear. The only thing that kept me from the full 5 stars is that I wish that his hourly rate were not as high as it is... however, I do feel that his knowledge and experience is something I will continue to regularly use. Thanks Todd!
We just moved here and were really excited about all the offroad trails and exploring there is here in las vegas. Unfortunately we didn't know anywhere to get new tires and lights for our jeep. Luckily we found the largest truck superstore in Nevada! This place is huge and they had everything, lift kits, bed liners, all sorts of truck accessories throughout the store. They had camper shells & tonneau covers, towing hitches, side steps - it was all very impressive and my wife and I agreed this is now our truck store in Vegas.
I never had a bad meal here. Highly recommend it

I just had my first S&R membership sale and it was pure chaos. If you're really into bulk buying then this sale is for you. Be ready to stand on long queues and bring extra patience with you. If you intend to shop bring a partner or two. While you shop have your partner stand in line waiting for the cashier hoping that when you're done it's your turn to pay.

Great prices, great atmosphere, overall a great time....
My son and I went to Uncle Bo's because we had a Groupon, and it was close to his work. I had the Blue Cheese burger basket and it was great. Nice people work there and we had a friendly visit with Randy Hasten, the owner. I would go again!

Good food, lots of different meat options when making a bowl. I could do without the waiter/waitress and tip, but the food is good enough to keep me coming back. The restaurant is good size but the tables can feel a little squished together.

Is this place perfect? No, of course not. But if I could have given 4.5 I would have. We love coming here. We come a couple of times a year. Always a great deal, rooms are fantastic, beautiful pool. If you want to have a Las Vegas Strip experience, maybe not this place. But a great place to come and bake in the sun and hang out in this fantastic city.
SOB has Great food, a good singer on a Monday evening in the September, plus cheap drinks ($5 uncle Billys ice tea, delicious! $3.50 yuengling!). Will stop by next time I'm in FMB.
We got a couple cheap, single rooms while we were in the city for two nights. Overall, the hotel was great for the price. Liked: Room 209 had comfortable beds, the staff was friendly and helpful, the rooms were really cheap. Disliked: The smell of cigarette smoke in the lobby (turns out this is because the first floor is the smoking floor). Other Thoughts: The Travelodge entrance is on the left side of the building when facing it from the road. I almost missed it since it was attached to the Super 8. Always call and ask about pet fees before booking.
Having dinner here for the first time
Armstrong is a beautiful little oasis in the mid-town area of Long Beach. I love going there just to walk around and look at all the beautiful flowers and pots they have on display. The fountains and organization of plants are wonderful. Plants and supplies are a little on the pricier side - but I do feel their staff are professionals and extremely helpful, when it's not too busy.
Mata's isn't very impressive at first glance, but once you taste the pizza you'll be coming back for more. Deep-dish with lots of toppings, covered in cheese and cooked to perfection, this is without a doubt the best pizza in town!
I have been coming here since the 1980's. Still has great food, and exceptional waitstaff.

Starters are very nice. Stay away from any dish with speck. It's so incredible bad bacon that I'm surprised it made it into the city of Paris.

I was very nervous while booking with this company but everything turned out great. They do ask you to fax your credit card information to them even after booking online and they also e-mail your voucher for the hotel stay for check-in which I found pretty odd but all was well. The prices were cheaper than everywhere else that I looked and they even allowed me to postpone my trip for a year because I obtained a new job right before the originally booked trip for only $50. Giovanna was very helpful with everything and, when I e-mailed the resort to confirm the reservation, everything was booked. No complaints here. It does seem like a shady operation but I had a good experience.
The monchong with mushroom sauce broke da mouth.

I went here despite the reviews, based on a personal friend's recommendation. She had acrylics put on and she said this was the first time EVER that they didn't come off before her 2-week fill appointment. So I took a chance. I was 15mins late to my appt due to traffic and they had no problem with it. I had the girl (the one every speaks so poorly of I assume) and she was very nice. I had gel nails put on, french style. I am one week in and the nails still look good. I also had my eyebrows waxed as a last minute decision. It was my first time and she was very helpful in understanding that i didn't want a reshape, just touch-up, and did a beautiful job in a comfortable private room. I am going back in 1 week for a fill and pedi with my girls before my wedding. If you are looking for an inexpensive but good quality "typical Asian-run nail salon" for your nail and waxing needs, this is the place for you! If you are turned off by this type of environment, the cheesy decor and non-english mumbling amongst the employees, then this is not the place for you - go to Boulder.
Buono , ampia scelta, economico e servizio puntuale
We come here every year for a show! It's always a fun experience!! You can't beat the prices, and the staff is always happy and cheerful while working. The Drive-in is a dying venue but Big Sky keeps the fight going! If you're visiting the Dells or are in the area this is a great evening experience.
Always impressed how the staff treats my 12-year-old son like a valued customer even though he doesn't spend much money there, but always wants to talk about games like he knows what he's talking about. They make him feel good, not like a bother.
Their General Tso's chicken seemed uninspired (as if they bought Meijer brand breaded chicken and sauced it up). Other than that, the rest is reasonably priced and tastes ok. I've had better and I've also had worse.
Toys of old times theme. Food is ok.
I've never had a problem with service and they are usually quick
Best, affordable and comfortable place.
Located in the Chelsea Market, The lobster place is THE place to find something to eat from the sea.
This is good value for the money. We have stayed there several times, while attending various events such as FetFest and Dark Odyssey, and have found that it does the job.
Great food and excellent value for money
The Shawarma roll is really awesome. Try it.
Biker bar full of regulars. Awesome happy hour, two for one beers. Great place to avoid crowds and loud pop music. One of my favorite places to enjoy a PBR while listening to ZZ Top. Things get rough later in the night, so avoid this place if you can't hang.

I only popped in to collect a meal that I had ordered over the phone, but I recieved a strong impression. The decor was beautiful and seating delightful! The staff were incredibly friendly and gave my younger sibling a chocolate and plenty of smiles. Delicious food- my entire family agree.

I've been shopping here and i like the store but they have limited cashiers i waited in line for about 30 minutes. overall i like the store great deals.
Ask for the renovated rooms off of the Select Tower as they are very, very nice! The room key gets you into the Tower which a $18 deal. Go at night to see the incredible 360 degree view!! However, beware of the $17 resort fee per day which you can contest.

worlds smallest comedy club but I've caught some great headliners here over the years.
I love this place! But... Rides need new restraints and paint jobs. Food is good, but needs some improving when it comes to price. Bathrooms need cleaning! But other than that, the rides are really fun and exciting!!! The theming is starting to get better. They are including more and more family attractions each year. And the employees are super nice and friendly! They actually get the job done! Lots and lots of great improvements each year!

Thursday night was good. Upstairs Rap room was jammed but the electronic/techno area was wide open. Would come back
Great german-style chips (thin & crunchy rather than thick & soggy) and curried sausages at (for London) reasonable prices. There's room for a few people to sit, but traditionally it's "to go". A little bit of a german train-station near Charing Cross. Try the chips in the traditional "rot-weiss" (red-white, ie, with ketchup and mayonaise) style.

Big city entertainment in a small town hidden treasure.
I took the course for AdWords and the Analytics course in New York and the 5 days were an excellent investment of time and money. I was able to immediately take my learning and apply it to client programs that I was running. The 3rd day of Analytics is very technical and I would not take that again because I did not need the programming information. Other than that I have been able to use everything I learned to make our ad programs and our web pages more effective!!
A little hard to find and quite small, try to get there a little before the rest of the lunch rush if you want to eat in (limited seating). The lentils and feta side was delicious, the coleslaw was mediocre. The Sliced Corned Beef with Swiss cheese melts in your mouth, if a little under seasoned. All in all a good value and experience.
None
You are greeted with a sincere smile with substance, fast service (great customer service) where you may catch the front house manager serving great burgers; killer milkshakes with the great theme of Grindhouse movies playing in the foreground. I recommend traveling to Midtown for a burger - even for the vegetarian (like me).
Quick and friendly service. The pad thai was delicious. The appetizers are pretty expensive. Picked up a appetizer combo and it doesn't come with rice? $8.50 for a few appetizers is ridiculous. I called and the guy on the phone stated it comes with rice. The place is always a ghost town. Guess business is bad. I'll stick to 4 seasons down the street

Great Italian food for a good price. My roommate came across it while walking around our neighborhood looking for something to eat. I love their spaghetti (especially their Jumbalaya) because their sauce is actually a little spicy and has real tomatoes, herbs and spices in it (it's not too sweet like some Taiwanese-Italian food out there). I was very impressed with this place overall and continue to bring people to it. I hope it keeps up their dishes and doesn't change anything.
The Manette Saloon is a great place to hang out with a small or large group of friends. Great happy hour deals, tasty food, and friendly staff.
Good service, fair pricing. Usually excellent skate sharpening. Wide selection of skis.

The 6th street location is very nice, good quality product and atmosphere that doesn't look cheap and quick like competition. The service, however, is lacking friendliness. I found that the staff treats its friends and regulars great but newcomers are frowned upon. I have been coming here since 2010 for every friday night open mic night and poetry singing. Snacks is very as is everyone else except employed staff I enjoy coming here and probably will for a long time. The coffee, bagels and quiche are all great. Just wish service wasn't so moody and inconsistent.

The service is really good. It can get super busy sometimes and I know its hard to get all the dishes made since asian cooking requires a lot of preparation, but the waitresses are very courteous. The specialty peking duck is to DIE FOR and the portions are fairly big.
I love pe. And always will. Got to love general tso's chicken (orange chicken at pe)
We stopped in to just check it out and stayed for dinner and drinks. Our server was attentive and a lot of fun. The food was tasty and the beers were ice cold. Definitely a cool place for a casual night out with fun as a bonus.

Never had faster or friendlier service. These gals are the best I have ever seen, and they are proud of it. There is another Tim's in Steinbach, this one trumps that one, and is better than most Tim's!

Great atmosphere, food, and waitstaff... I will definitely go there again. However, they seem to have a couple of hostesses with really poor attitudes. One of them had the audacity to ask if we were "actually going to order dinner" after we had been seated at our table for a little bit enjoying appetizers and drinks with friends. Since when is that an appropriate question?
I bought a Groupon for 10 classes at this gym. So far, I've tried the spin class and liked it. There's only a small number of bikes, but the instructor was good and it was a good change of pace for me. The gym is clean and the staff are friendly. It's also in a great location and easy to get to after work!

I go there every Sunday morning. I love the place. Its a little dinner with a great food.

Best room and bath at a motel 6. Would have liked the front to be a little cleaner, but the workers were pleasant and helpful.
Great restaurant - I always end up eating too much here. The Strawberry and white wine sangria is incredible. I haven't ever been game myself, but they have a wall of pain for those with a higher tolerance for spicy food. I would definitely recommend.
Mmm, oysters bigger than my face!
We get our deer meat processed here & it's always really really good. They are always nice to my husband when he brings the deer. When I went to pick it up for him once they weren't the friendliest folks, but they did help me carry it out. The quality of the processing is excellent.
The food is amazing! And so is getting to watch him cook everything in front of you. But the service wasn't that great. We had to wait forever to get our food started and then wait forever to get our bill and wait yet again for them to come back and get our payment.
restaurant is good for home like food. medium spicy food with good home delivery service.
Don't let the the looks of the place scare ya off. Yea, it's an old house. Don't ya know the best food comes from these places? Try the flour chips... Mmmmm. Libby's special tostada is delicious.

One of my favorite restaurants ever! Authentic food that tastes absolutely delicious. I especially enjoy the machitos and yuca with bacon. If you like Latin food, I would highly recommend checking this place out!
Joe's is a hometown grill and bar serving american food at reasonable prices. Burger Mondays and Sandwich Tuesdays are the best days to go. Choose any burger on Monday or any sandwich on Tuesday for just $5. The burgers are great and the service is usually pretty good.
The food was below average, the service was very good, and the restaurant has a nice set up. Its worth going to once, but chances are I wont make the drive again.

I have had breakfast here a few times and had lunch once. On every occasion the service has been prompt and polite. Food and coffee very good. One minor annoyance - no Chardonnay by the glass and the only other wines BTG do not suite my palate. I've tried heaps of places for breakfast over many years and The Hutch is one of the better ones.
A simple wrap place, good options, including house-made hummus. Wraps have flavor and sauce without being a drippy mess. They may be the only dessert option, but at 2 for a dollar, the brownies are a good deal. They're basic chocolate sheet brownies, but with some large walnuts and dried cherries dropped on top. The lunch specials let you substitute brownies for fries!
Great sandwiches, burgers, garlic fries. Cash only for now. Call ahead if you're in a rush, everything cooked to order (& well worth the wait)
They have really, really good beer and food but unfortunately the service is often very poor and unfriendly.
Good food. Friendly staff.

You get a fair amount of pizza for the price, and it tastes reasonably good when fresh compared to any other food you can get at this speed and price. No comparison to papa John's and godfathers obviously.

high end italian food, arrived earlier to my reservation time, but had drink in the bar which is packed and a cool place to hangout. dinner was very good (tuna tartare and spaghetti with meatballs), authentic italian, very vast wine list, pricing was expensive, but well worth it. the DJ spinning nice tunes all night. everything was great UNTIL the dessert arrived, I ordered Tiramisu (my favorite) but the one they gave me it appeared to be out of a pre made dessert box from walmart, that was the only negative of my dining experience, otherwise it would have been perfect
They now don't open until 11am on Sundays

Excellent quick food, nice environment, highly recommend.
The grocery store has an interesting smell. I understand it smells a great deal better than the Ram's store downtown. Wednesday is the day the fresh fruit and vegetables arrive. The only meat here is frozen. Nice selection of frozen foods and a great liquor aisle. A superb selection of (East) Indian foods. Sunday hours are ridiculously brief. No grocery shopping day on St. Kitts is complete without having to visit all 3 grocery stores as each has some of the items you need but not all of the items you need.
This is what I call an excellent service. Me and my husband showed up at this place without a reservation and yet the staff managed to find us a table. Always a pleasure to eat Thai food. Good portion size and yes - they do deliver. So why don't you give it a try.
a comida é boa e o ambiente agradavel, recomendo .....
4 star only because Moxie is relatively new to us and we've only used them a couple of times. Reasonable price, good professional service. Our last call was handled by Tommy Kane who came and sprayed in and out of the house. When we said we may have a mouse problem, he readily explained our options, installed a deterrent, and gave specific instructions. No complaints, will recommend.
So agora arrumei tempo pra almoçar.
Not too much to say. I like the fact that the price is close to regular parking, and the shuttle drives right up to your car and loads the bags. I had no issues leaving the vehicle there for over a week, and pickup was fast on my return.

Clean, friendly and if you know buffets... don't be an idiot.... show up early or yes you may have stuff that sat in the steam tables for a while. It is common sense!

I really like this place, and have been going here for lunch a fair bit - until this week. I could be missing something, but they've been closed the whole week, without a sign on the door or any indication of what's going on via their Twitter account or on Facebook. The sandwiches are some of the best I've ever had. Portion sizes are reasonable. It's on the expensive side, but I think it's totally worth it if you appreciate well crafted organic and locally sourced food. They present the wares really well too, which I appreciate. The only criticism I have is that the wait time can be a borderline turn off. Bowich is smack dab in the middle of the downtown lunch market, and a 25 minute wait can be difficult to work on a government lunch.
Nice cafe with tasty pies. It's not expensive at all and a good place to relaxe.
Really, do we need another "K&Z's is great!" review.... ..too bad, it is! A great place to pick up a sangy to go if you're driving or taking the train home. A Portland institution for a damn good reason. Don't miss it!

I really like working with Angela. I have worked with many State Farm Agents, and Angela is one of my Favorites. She is sharp, to the point , and is a top tier agent in Idaho. I would call her for your insurance needs.
I am not sure if I am disappointed or satisfied. The Entree and dessert were superb but the main was very disappointing (we had fish). The service was excellent and the staff were very attentive. I will go again once I have paid off the mortgage

it is a very good shop where you can get most of your daily household needs
If you need a cup of coffee for a great price, Red House is the way to go. Although its not the best coffee in Weaverville, it is great for the price. If you go between 4 and 5 everything is half off, making a warm (or cold) coffee on the patio a vacation for the taste buds and the wallet. If your looking for great baristas and amazing coffee, and willing to spend the extra cash, Strawhouse or Mama Llama's is the way to go, but if your looking for a step up from Starbucks but with a much greater atmosphere and price, come by Red House!
Great place for a lunch on a nice sunny day. Good atmosphere.

A quality, family owned power-sports company. The best service experience I've ever had. They have a huge selection of motorcycles and ATVs, tons of gear to choose from, and all at as decent prices as I've seen anywhere else. The staff is very polite and helpful. they actually know about and use the things they sell. The service department was a dream. I called first thing Saturday morning and explained how my lights have been malfunctioning lately, that my last headlight had blown, and that my bike was my only ride. Toney welcomed me to come in ASAP and made sure my bike was looked at immediately. One headlight had blown, the opposite light's fuse had blown, and my speedometer light bulb had blown(all over the course of a few months). Corey, who was working on my bike, volunteered his own spare headlight bulb since the shop didn't have that bulb in stock. After an hour of service, I had a new headlight bulb, speedometer bulb, headlight fuse, air in my tires, and a recommendation to get my chain and sprockets replaced as soon as I could(which I knew). Toney only charged me for the headlight bulb at a discounted price and the labor. I was out of there in less than two hours.

I remember when that little spot was a diner called The Ring. Best hot dogs and burgers in town for a long time. Now it's a really good spot for great Thai food at a very reasonable price. A friend brought me there, and I was impressed. The jerky was great, and the "Awesome Noodles" actually lived up to the name. My friend ordered food that would melt the space shuttle, so I didn't try it, but she said it was great. The decor is very old-town, which helps with the charm. You can hear the bands on the stage in back of the club next door, but that's not a bad thing, depending on your taste in music. Our waiter was very cool and knowledgeable of the food. We waited for our check for a few minutes, but that's understandable because they were very busy. That in itself is a good sign... and to add to that, there were quite a few people of Asian culture eating there, which is considered to be the first sign of a good Asian restaurant. This is one of those cool "hole-in-the-wall" spots with great food. I'll be back there frequently since I live only a few blocks away.
Caros los tragos, bueno el Whisky Blue
Can't get enough of the tater tots!
The rooms are well appointed, clean, and well laid out. The breakfast in the morning is more than just a bagel and some coffee, and the fireplace and dining room are large enough to hold a meeting if needed. The staff is polite and the location is quiet, which is great for a good night sleep. Oh, and they keep a bottle of hot sauce out for the eggs, which made my day. :-)
This place is great for breakfast and lunch. The prices are so reasonable and the service is excellent. If you're a regular, they call you by name and remember your order. I'd definitely recommend this place, especially if you work downtown. :) xoxo
Burgers were very good. The chili was also delicious as were the desserts with portions big enough for about 2 to 3 people. Service was okay but in their defense the location was near closing. The waitress was pleasant but at times a little absent. Overall a great experience and would definitely recommend.
Dr Chai is great!
Food is great! Got some sushi and some other great tasting meals. The staff was nice and very attentive to refills and the delivery team is awesome as well. Guy forgot my sprite and went and got it within five minutes! Would definitely update inside but great other wise.
Très bonne musique, le service au bar est rapide. Cependant les toilettes, c'est pas le top, et la piste est un peu trop petite !
First time there, very good. We had the Parmesan Chicken and appetizers. The wait staff were very attentive. I would go back.

Was told the order would be ready in 15 minutes. 15 minutes later the food was ready! Everything tasted pretty decent. Not the best Chinese I've ever had but it was above average! My usual rating for a Chinese food place is 4 or 5 out of 10. This place was easily a 7.5/10! I will be going back next time I get take-out or delivery.
i had been in contact with James Anderson for a few months before I made my purchase of my Passat from West Broad, He got me everything I asked for in my car at the price I was looking for, the follow up care from the sales and management team at West Broad made my purchase an easy and enjoyable experience.
The Space Apart London had everything we needed to feel at home in London. Although it was small it was well organized, comfortable and clean.
Love this place! The potions are big. The brisket rocks, great pecan pie, more kinds of beer than you could drink in a month and the kids (and us adults) love the mac and cheese balls!

I am positively addicted to the taco salad with shrimp and the mango salsa. And, yet, everything I've tried is really good too. The service is always exceptional and the prices are comparable to Chipotle and/or Qdoba and taste much more unique at this point. I say, "go!" and go often.

I worked with Alan G. at Leith VW to purchase my first used car. Customer service was great from the very beginning. I never once felt like I was being corralled into buying a car. Alan provided genuine and honest advice. I love my new Jetta and would highly recommend this dealership!
No wait, straight forward, efficient yet thorough.
Been there several times, the staff is always glad to see you and make you feel at home, good ambiance, and menu is priced well. Everyone that we've taken has vowed to return on their own.
Google Maps zeigt das Hotel an der falschen Stelle! Es befindet sich auf der anderen Seeseite in Vogorno direkt an der Hauptstrasse/Seestrasse. Nur Basis-Frühstück inklusive. Wurst/Schinken und Käse kosten extra.
I have been here for almost 4 years. Here are things I like about Celio 1. Great Location - Short walk away from Alphabet District, Grocery stores, Down town Portland, max station , Jeld wen field (home of Timbers) and list just add up. 2. Great maintenance service - My work orders always get done on time. 3. Parking availability 4. Great Rooftop view - Clear view of Mt. hood , St. Helens. 5. Friendly Staff 6. Safest area of Portland
My daughter really enjoyed her visit. The staff catered to her needs and concerns as well as ours, they answered all of our questions, provided a thorough examination, and made sure to include her in the conversation. Although the cost was more than we had anticipated it was nice to have options to work with. The office is also inviting for children and Chloe was able to see other patients being treated which made her feel more at ease. We hope to work through insurance options and move forward with her treatment.
High priced hotel, but nothing included. Breakfast, WiFi, refrigerator are for additional price :-(
wie immer köstlich, gemütlich, ausgefallenes Menü & cooles personal!
I love Chipotle. Their food is great quality, and they give you a generous portion. When i first started to go to Chipotle, the portion sizes were slightly larger because they gave you more meat. I always get the burrito bowl, and the food used to make a small mountain that they would have to crush when they put on the lid. Nowadays the mountain is pretty much level with the rim of the bowl. But it's still enough to feed you. And as for the lines, i can see why they're so long. What Chipotle needs is a drive-thru. After all, it wasn't meant to be a 5 star restaurant. So if they're going the route of fast food burritos, then they might as well add a drive-thru to alleviate some of the heavy traffic from inside. They could be like In n Out: another place that makes its food fresh, but serves it fast food style.
A good place to stay and dine with family...good reasonable rates gud fud and clean rooms...
This was our first time at any Johnny Rocco's. In general it was a pleasant experience. The restaurant was very clean, nice environment, the food was very good and the service was very good as well. We went there for lunch and we had great time. We would recommend this location to a friend no problem. My wife ordered a New York (steak) and I ordered something called Nonna's meatballs (not sure about the name but it was kind of a sandwich) with Parmesan potatoes. I would give 5 stars to the stake and 4 stars to the meatballs. The service was fast and we were in and out in about an hour.

I visit Ventnor around twice a year and every day enter for a drink and coffee and dinner at some point. El-Toro is the best things about Ventnor.
Nice place. Its calming during weeknights and crowded and clubish on weekends. Smart dress code on weekends too. Never tried the food but cocktails are well made and overal I recommend it.
Does not look great from the outside just now. But clean and with lots of helpful residents. A good condominium. There is even wifi from somewhere. We just rented for a week.

We love to go meander a bit with the kids here. Plenty of open space as well as trails...and kids love to hit the playground before we leave.
Divas is a great place to go for straight people as well as their advertised gay/lesbian crowd. There is always a mix here, but they are very friendly so as a curvy goddess I don't feel self conscious dancing here :). Their drinks can be expensive but they usually have specials like $3 jello shots. The themes they come up with are pretty cool, check their fb and website for info. While the inside does look a bit run-down it's not anything you notice once the lights are down and music up. Great outdoor smoking/cooling off area. Recommend for girl's night out, birthdays.
Decent portions of lovely chips
First time I've ever had crawfish ettoufee that had rosemary in it and it was horrible. When I sent it back the lady there told me that they would not replace my meal without an extra charge. BTW I am from creole land and have eaten and fixed this style food all of my life. Never heard of it being fixed like this and this place is sayid to be owned by a creole. They don't have file powder and they dont serve Community Coffee, REALLY!!!!

We recently bought a dish washing machine, but when we arrived at our home we realized that our kitchen is not adjusted for our new machine. We called these guys and they arrived on very next day. They installed proper hoses and taps and mounted our washing machine. All that was done for less than one hour. Few days later we discovered a small leak, when we called them they said "No problem we will arrive after half an hour" and they really did it - came to our house for second time and fixed the problematic hose for no extra charge.
I've heard nothing but great things about this place! When I finally went, I promised the Manager I would leave a positive review. Most People only go on these things to leave negative reviews about the places they go. I must say, wonderful place to dine! lol Great food cute atmosphere and nice people :)

Last Friday I called these guys. We have a big three seated sofa and a couple of cushions in the living room that needed cleaning. I explained that and the operator was very fast with the quote and the booking. After some days, a team came with some king of modified vacuum cleaner, made specially for the case. They did a great job with our furniture and I am definitely saving their number in my contact list.
Very good

was looking for a burger and was surprised to find that the night I visited was $5 burger night. My only complaint would be that it didn't match the Tavern Burger on the menu - no pretzel bun (which I would have loved to try.) Server was friendly and attentive. Had a nice evening.
Not much of a sandwich person but boy oh boy do I love Sammie's. You can't go wrong with the Santa Cruz!
Called at about 6 pm for an 8:45 car to JFK from Prospect Park South/Flatbush. The dispatcher was friendly, and she called back just before my scheduled time to let me know what the (unmarked) cab looked like and that it was three minutes away. No complaints at all about the cab ride itself! Will definitely use again.

Great in education but still needs more activities because It's collage not a school.
It's rare to find a spot that both parents and their kids can enjoy at the same time. The “wind powered” Outer Banks Brewing Station is just such a place. On sunny days, parents can enjoy a brewed on site beer, while the young ones play on the pirate ship playground found in the brewery’s grassy backyard. I think that's the epitome of "Win-Win". I love the Lemongrass Wheat Ale and the Irie Tropic Stout. I wish I had taken more time to explore the food menu. I understand the Pho Night menu (each Thursday) is really good. Oh well, good reason for a road trip back to the beach!

Our stay at the hotel was goo. My children really enjoyed the pool area and game room. The room was clean and the beds comfortable. Breakfast could use some improvements as we prefer fresh fruit to canned fruit cocktail.When we went down there was no breakfast attendant and many of the things we needed were empty. I was very disappointed to find when i got home that I had been charged twice for my room. The lady who checked me in had trouble with the credit card machine and charged me twice. When I called the hotel to get this fixed they said they couldn't do it right away as it was a Saturday and that I would need to call back Monday and have them fix it! :( This to me is very frustrating!

A friend of mine produced his own show with the help of the Dog Story Theater so I went there to see it. I really liked both the play and the venue itself but then again I'm not that hard to impress. The most important thing is that I really enjoyed myself that night and might even become a regular.
If you're looking for homey classic Polish food, this is the right place for you. It feels a little like my aunt's kitchen, it's authentic. The wait staff is friendly. The decor is right from the 70's, but you should overlook that because the food is good. I recommend the potato/cheese [Ruskie] pierogies. The saurekraut/mushroom are good too. The best deal is the Polish platter. It's a smagoaboard of different Polish dishes. For dessert [if you have room] get some blintzes.
Very spectacular show. The female act with the large hoop was particularly impressive. Male lead singer was poor. Given the time of year, the show could have had a more traditionally seasonal content.

Nice hotel with basement car parking. But ecpensive. I paid 500 rs /night for 4 single beds.
Good Food.
The best chicken wings ever!!! They have an exclusive Sauce called "the combo sauce" it's the bomb!
Los burritos, tacos y tamales son muy buenos
music depends on the day, price of drinks is acceptable (5euros/drink, 6euros Mojito). Really tasty and refreshing Mojito. I've been there 3-4 times. The place has a unique character, colourful, and alternative. Definitely one of the bars i like going when I go out in Amsterdam. Open also during day, and there are a lot of workshop, etc. Visit their site, they usually have a music happening, etc.
Very good Chicken iteam & Chicken Pokoda is very testy.
Amazing service! I recommend this place to everyone looking for help & a fair price.
Very fun & excellent service, but WAY too expensive. If the price were practical, business would be booming. The day I went (a beautifully sunny June day) we were the only people there. I feel like with how short the ride is, maybe $20 for 3 rides down the hill would be reasonable. That's still on the pricey side, but I would probably pay it. $50 should give you unlimited rides all day, not a single minute long ride. It's like paying for a day pass at Dollywood but only getting to ride one ride. Does that make sense? I feel like it doesn't make sense economically, there's so much opportunity to make more money.
Excellent, tasty, filling and cheap.
Love the ambiance with all the old, very old photographs that cover the wall. Good home cooking.
Its a lot cleaner than the TB on Bridge street and the staff is always friendly. Food is Taco Bell quality so if your looking for a 5 star place, then this isn't it.

This is a nice Japanese family owned restaurant. The cuts of fish are good and the service is also good. It's just a little overpriced, I would understand if it were port-side and the fish couldn't get any fresher, but that's obviously not the case.

I have been going to Ancona service forever and O'Neill's process just seemed smoother. I felt like they were a bit more professional. They did not find the odd clicking noise with my brakes, but I hope to show them soon.
The overall atmosphere was nice. The food was excellent, but our waitress was a bit of a... "female dog", if you catch my drift. I won't mention names, as these things are public and I don;t want to be the reason for someone else's trouble at work... Needless to say, despite the waitress, I was very happy with the overall experience. Will return in the future.
This hotel is a gem. It's walking distance from the University and the fun Downtown and Haymarket areas of Lincoln at a great price. Rooms are clean, beds are comfortable, kitchenettes are well stocked, Staff is friendly. Rish, the general manager, is a friendly face to greet you every day.

Charley was very helpful in finding health care for me as an individual in the $100/month price range. He went over 3 options surrounding that price mark in an unbiased manner and allowed me to choose the best plan for my personal situation. That being said, I am lucky in that I have no pre-existing conditions. Reading the previous reviews, I find it unfortunate that Mr. Mallon would throw himself more in line with the insurance providers than the clients he serves. I believe it is an unfortunate state of our society that insurance companies want to know of a client's pre-existing condition up to 10 years back! I can understand 6 months, but anything more than that is a ploy to charge higher premiums to less fortunate individuals. But, for my fortunate circumstances, Charley proved very helpful. I'll put the blame on the system over the individual who has to work in it.

I love this place. My first visit was the day they opened. The food was great then and it still is. The staff is friendly but since it is more of a buffet don't expect to be waited on hand and foot.
They have awesome burgers. i live in Ft Worth and they also have the BEST onion rings. But we rarely go there because witha family of 5 I can't afford to eat there. Most times it costs nearly $10 for 1 person to eat a burger w side and drink :(
Went with my husband & he loved it, great place here in Eagle Pass to go to. Food was good and pretty good service :)
Great food but delivery was extremely slow! Took over an hour and I am less than 10 minutes away.
I served an LDS mission in Germany and the food really brought me back to those days. Great food, great store attached. A little pricey, but definitely worth it.
I like this Store
Railway crossing a big problem for home delivery. But for me pizza means domino's pizza and when it gives that offer one on one.. Its xcellent.
Great hamburger, perfect kettle chips, very good onion rings, great French dip. Bowling alley decor, an obvious local favorite!

Definitely worth a visit. The atmosphere is great, the beef was awesome and the prawns were delicious. Only the clams were a little disappointing, definitely stick with the BBQ food. All up a great meal for 500k VND for 2 people.
The only store in Austin that can justifiably claim to be the go-to place for professional photographers. (Years ago there were competitors, but no more.) The Repair department is very good. Sales Dept includes my favorite knowledgeable, helpful photographic equipment consultant in town--if I tell you who he is, I'll have to wait even longer to talk to him. (I've heard of other salesfolks not being so helpful, but I find the service great from him.) Rentals is pretty good for almost any need. Used equipment choice is pretty good, too. If you're a pro, or advanced amateur, you'll find it your best bet for solving almost any photo problem. I'm a 40-year working professional photographer, and a fan... If there was no Precision Camera, Austin would be a bleak place for the working pro.
Bring your own bag, I cannot stress this bit enough. The clothes I got are some of the best I've been able to afford in a long time. I understand that I can only return clothes for store credit, but that's okay, because I can always just pick out something new if one thing doesn't fit. Overall, I really liked it.

This me introduced to the world of waterfalls. I hadnt seen any waterfalls before. And when I got a glimpse of this piece I skipped a heartbeat. I was taken aback that it would blow me with it hurricane like force. The water was flowing with gushing speed and the sprinkles of the falls could be seen and felt from quite a distance. Prefer the peak monsoon season to visit this place as without that the place not be quite a waterfall. There is a sesa goa mining place below that fall, after a temple and the "moksh dham", which is connected by a small iron bridge which is quite exciting to walk on when there is a lot of water flowing through it. Also for the Gujarati friends there is a "Mahaprabhuji Baithak" temple. There were also some caves nearby but due to heavy rains we didnt go there. But overall a place worth visiting in the peak of monsoon.
A great curry whether you eat in or get a take away. Always pleased to see you. Definitely not closed as the status seems to say.

Very nice pub and grill. Food is decent and the staff is great. Great place for a beer and some pool.
Very pleased they could repair my favorite winter work shoes at such a low rate!
I've always had a pleasent experience when visiting pho so. The food is good the portions are good all at good price. Customer service never disappoints. All in all great place.
Try it you'll like.
Now that Borders is gone, B&N is the best bookstore in the South Bend, Indiana area. They have a great reading area and a comprehensive periodical section. The staff has always been helpful and very knowledgeable. This location does offer a Starbucks licensed (not the same as a Starbucks) cafe. Wireless connectivity can be unreliable. Parking at the University Park Mall must have been designed by someone with a sick sense of humor or total incompetence since getting in and out is beyond challenging during busy times.
Our group went to Lipstick Dallas last week & found out they now offer free cover everyday till 1pm which is good. The place has been cleaned up & has new dancers & waitresses also a few new managers. You cant beat the long happy hour till 9pm everyday with $2 beers & $2.50 wells. We know Lipstick is not a highend Club although it has a laid back feel to it where you dont get hasseled by high priced dancers bugging you for $$$. We noticed there were food menus on each table with lots to choose from so we took a change on strip club food & must say were impressed. Nachos, tacos even steak was good. To sum it up we were there for 4 hours & had a great time, we will be back. Keep in mind the negative reviews for Lipstick here our 2 years old & this Club has changed for the better so you have to see for yourself.

I love Tool Town Pizza, but I must say that I really, REALLY miss how they used to make the pizzas before the current owners. I used to be able to almost polish off a large pepperoni pizza all by myself. It was that good. I still give them a 2 though, but beg them to try and make it like they used to!
I've always loved this Bugatti's. The service is friendly and professional, the food is great, the atmosphere is nice, and prices are very reasonable. It's one of our favorite go-to places, a place we like to take out of town visitors. The thing that really makes it stand out though, is the complimentary focaccia bread and olive oil for dipping. My husband, daughter and son in law were there last Friday night, and it was very busy. We had to ask for the focaccia bread and oil, which usually come automatically. After asking twice we finally received it, and then only one small serving. I hope that this was only because the restaurant was so busy, and that it isn't going by the way-side. As I said, it's the thing that really makes Bugatti's stand out in my mind. If they do away with it, we won't go there nearly as often, and it'll become like any other Italian restaurant. So please, keep it coming!

Located right by Termini Station, the location can't be beat. After discovering (later) that Italy generally doesn't accept Euro Traveler's cheques - Hotel Chicago did. The friendly hotel staff allowed me to use their computer. The room was well kept and the decor was nice, location was quiet. Breakfast was brought to your room in the morning and included juice, buns, jam and toast. Milk, coffee and tea available as well if desired. The breakfast wasn't incredibly filling as compared to other continental breakfasts, but it did fill a space. The Free Wifi didn't have the strongest signal and I needed to stay by the window for the best signal, which was a nuisance. I would stay here again, but this was my first time in Rome so I have no other comparison in this city, but I have traveled before.

Ich habe im Januar 2011 eine Nacht in einem 8 Bett "Dorm" Zimmer übernachtet. Für gerade mal 10€. Das Checkin war auch mitten in der Nacht kein Problem. Check Out Zeit war mit 11 Uhr halbwegs großzügig bemessen. Zimmer, Betten und Sanitäranlagen waren sauber. Ansonsten ist in der Dorm Zimmern alles einfachst: Dünne Matratze, Bettdecken & Kopfkissen nur mit Synthetikfüllung, Bettwäsche & Handtuch nur gegen Aufpreis. Die Übernachtung mit eigenem Schlafsack oder mitgebrachter Bettwäsche ist kein Problem. Ein gewisses Risiko bei den Dormzimmern: Man teilt sich das Zimmer mit Fremden. Evtl. also auch mit Schnarchern. Die eigenen Dinge können, wenn ein Vorhängeschloss mitgebracht oder erworben wird, im Zimmer eingeschlossen werden. Dies bietet einen leichten Schutz. Wirklich einbruchsicher sind die Schränke aufgrund ihrer dünnen Rückwand nicht. Frühstück gibt es für 4€, habe ich aber nicht getestet. Alles in allem: Eine Top Leistung für 10€!
Tons of stuff for camping or hiking (of course). A ton of stuff in stock. However, there wasn't a lot of people staffed to trying to find help was a bit of a pain but overall not a show stopper.
Great place to get all your printing needs done quickly and professionally. They will go that extra mile to make sure you get the best service and print job possible.

This restaurant was simply a delight. The food was well prepared and delicious to the last bite. Our waiter was polite enjoyable as well as engaging. A fantastic restaurant we look forward to returning again soon.
The breads are tasty and full of body. The texture is nice and chewy with a good crust. The Taro Oat bread is nice without being overly sweet.
Not our first choice, but Soho just before Christmas is busy! It was full in the restaurant so we were offered a high table with fold-out bar stools - not the most comfortable table ever but it was good of them to accommodate us. Decor is fine - unpretentious, functional, quite middle of the road. Verging on boring... The service was very friendly - especially considering service charge was included. A refreshing change from the hurried, bustling service elsewhere in central London. I had the pork - it was tender and well cooked, and £16 was probably about right. My companions had the steak, which was a big piece of meat - £48 shared between two - perhaps a little on the expensive side but it was well cooked and tasty. We finished off our meal by sampling their home made vermouth - which was very impressive, especially the white, which had lovely herby, earthy flavours. All in all, I prefer somewhere a little more intimate and with a stronger sense of identity. It was a good evening, with helpful, friendly staff, and tasty (but not extraordinary) food.
Good food, nice variety, Great environment.

The staff at Elk Grove Pet Clinic are friendly and knowledgable and care about your pet. The Pet Clinic has hours that are condusive to working families and offer a wide range of services for cats and dogs. I will continue to use their services for my dog as long as they are around. Susan Pearson
excellent company would recommend using them. very professional and reliable.
Bel locale in stile irish pub..bella fornitura di birre irlandesi e pietanze veramente apprezzate sia da me che dalla comitiva..consiglio vivamente =)
Great friendly service. Pretty decent food.
Stayed last year for Mobile World Congress. Going again this year
Excellently located probably the best sea view hotel in the area. Falls short when it comes to dinning. Overall value for money. The staff is courteous and extend assistance willingly. Although I have stayed during off season my experience was excellent.

Best Mexican in Lakewood. The open air breeze feels good on a nice day.
Love the wings! Service is so-so. I've noticed lately they seemed to be closing early. I hope they don't close.
I worked here for quite sometime, food and coffee is good, I loved the customers and my coworkers... and it SUCKS to see so many bad reviews about customer service... Customer service sucks because one person is scheduled to work morning rush. Being stressed or overwhelmed you forget to do things for the customer, it's not good for business or the customers satisfaction obviously. From my experience employees try their hardest to assure the customers have a good experience... but you can't be barista, cook, server and hostess all at once. Simple solution for a simple problem.
Love working here, the people are friendly and management dose a wonderful job.
Went there a week ago , and from the outside it looks deceiving, with its out dated look. But the food was great I love their wings !!!. It was weird though they only had 2 ppl working their at the time , but they cooked our food quickly and were very friendly . Their wings are AMAZING !! I got cajun , and it was delicious !! . THe wings are like covered in the sauce which is , to me the best part about eating wings is getting messy . And I sure did the sauce was out of this world and the wings were great !!. It is a must EAT !!
U have a very amazing exellent student so called Indriana Puji Lestari
Great pizza, great prosciutto and tomato and mozzarella sandwiches..... Probably the best meal I have had since getting to Rome.
I enjoyed it but for 2 of us we spent $80.00 before tip. I thought that was pretty pricey for mexican food. I probably won't go back, because of the price.
Great sandwiches and b's burgers. Farm fresh food!
This is the best charter I have ever been on. We caught a shark and a sailfish on the same half day deal! My kids fed the tarpon on the way in and we were so excited. The crew was the best, Captain Lige and Chaz were so fun and professional. I would recommend this to everyone.
The Asiago bagels are fantastic which keeps me coming back for more!! Love the cinnamon crunch bagels also!! Just one problem is the bagel slicer does not cut the bagel well and I never get the bagel sliced all the way through!!
Loved the stay at the hotel, very friendly staff and ambiance. The only downfall was that though i informed them i will be coming with my wife for our honeymoon, and they said they will sort something for us in the room, nothing was arranged!
Delicious food, good atmosphere. well family oriented restaurant.
One of my favorite places to get gluten free and absolutely delicious pizza. Build your own or try one of their specialties. A "green" restaurant will also make you feel good about helping the environment. Definitely try their infused oils on your pizza.
Excellent food - great service - my wife and I go there often for what she claims is the best coffee on the coast (I'm not a coffee freak). Used to go most mornings for breakfast, but now she is working in Brisbane she insists we go both days of the weekend without fail. Try their club sandwich for lunch. Great.
I first say Dr Ornoff when I found a practice that would accept my dental plan. I had was long overdue for an exam and a crown for a root canal done years earlier. He was attentive, friendly and answered all my frequent questions. He did not scold, but did recommend more frequent visits (duh!). After the cleaning, he fitted me for my crown and installed a temporary crown. While the temporary crown did not stay attached, a call to Dr Ornoff assured me that all was ok and that no damage would be done by simply waiting for my permanent crown. I've had that crown for 4 years now, no problems, better quality of life and worth every penny of co-pay. The office staff was never pushy about payments, but they did keep me advised of what was expected prior to receiving services - no surprises. All in all it was a good experience, No pain, everything explained, no surprises and great outcome for reasonable price.
Very good pediatric surgery department
I love going to Crooked Tree. They make the best Chi Latte's and I enjoy trying their seasonal Latte's - creative mixes and YUMMY!! And the food is great there too!!
Auditorium looks very good...the stage view is great...
Good egg rolls and crab rangoons. Good chicken fried rice, decent hot and sour soup. Nice deal on delivery if you order more than $25. Driver took just under an hour.
Very friendly staff, clean facilities, wonderful water access, and definitely seems like a lot of repeat guests year round. We would totally stay here again. We stayed at the rustic sites beachfront and used the community grills.

The best Mexican restaurant in town! We don't have a lot of money so we don't get out as often as we'd like but when we do and want Mexican food, this is the place to go. Service is terrific, the food is very good and the atmosphere is great.

pretty good. If they dont have it they will get it. Only problem is that they are ALWAYS VERY busy... I think its because each customer gets a lot of time with the guy at the desk.
Definitely think this garage needs more of a reputation and more people should know about them! The guys working there are all super friendly, and care about the cars they are working on. My car was hit by a transmission failure and it looked as though it was going to be expensive to fix, but I stumbled across Automatic Man. They had my car back up and running, good as new, within a week. I was so pleased with the work they did, and that I wasn't without a car for too long! I didn't pay too much money, and my car has never driven better! Four months on, and still no problem with it!

We have been here both on/off season and have had great food and the service has always been excellent. Crab soup is delicious. We were here just a few days ago as a family of six and had comfortable seating. Larger parties may have to split up. Its not a huge place, so be realistic and expect to wait during the summer. Overall, I would recommend, and we definitely plan to go back!

We were welcomed in at 6.30 pm . Friendly and courteous. Served by Steve who was excellent, friendly and very helpful, Food was served promptly and was very good. We go to our local Harvester in Solihull on a regular basis.Always delighted with service and value for money. If you're on holiday near Westbourne or Bournemouth, the Durley Inn Harvester is well worth a visit.
Ho scoperto l'agriturismo del cimone sul web. Di solito prendevamo una casa per una settimana a Sestola, ma l'ultima volta nel 2010 avevamo speso 700€ per una settimana in appartamento e quindi abbiamo indagatoi un po' su Internete. Le foto del sito erano invitanti e devo dire che già salendo per i 10km che la separano da Fanano si torna indietro nel tempo, Se siete abituati agli agriturismi di campagna o di mare questo è un'altra cosa. Il posto è magico, il panorama mozzafiato e le strutture ricettive in pietra e la cura per i particolari in stile montanaro hanno proiettato me e la mia famiglia in una dimensione "antica". Abbiamo provato nel gennaio 2011 ed ormai da tre anni è una vacanza fissa. Nella settimana da noi trascorsa agli inizi di gennaio di quest'ano abbiamo anche potuto provare la sauna e la tinozza calda all'aperto, durante una nevicata e questa esperienza unica e che resterà stampante per sempre nelle nostre memorie ci ha spinto a fare questa recensione positiva. Ma torniamo a noi... Il cibo è abbondante e genuino, con cucina tipica fananese non vi aspettate salmone, caviale o frutta esotica. Qui la parola d'ordine è kilometrozero e a parte la farina per il pane e le spezie arriva tutto dalle stalle! Il servizio a volte è meraviglioso a volte lascia un po' a desiderare (dipende dalle emergenze che la famiglia che gestisce l'agriturismo deve affrontare - bestie scappate, recinti rotti, nevicate copiose..) La sensazione è che sia una famiglia come tutte con alti e bassi, ma gente cordiale... tranne quando sono indaffarati a spalare la neve e magari c'è da mettere a tavola 50 persone...meglio fare due chiacchere dopo cena davanti ad una grappa. La camera che ci è sempre "toccata" è carinissima, calda e accogliente. ma la struttura e complessa e ci sono diverse sistemazioni... non abbiamo visto le altre. Se avete figli under 14 si divertiranno sicuramente e staranno una settimana senza guardare un solo minuto di tv. Le piste da sci a 5 minuti di auto, sono sul versante di fronte, le potete vedere la mattina quando vi svegliate e scegliere in base alle condizioni atmosferiche se dormire qualche minuto im più. Se volete ciaspolare, passegiiare a cavallo, a semplicemente fare due passi c'è solo l'imbarazzo dell scelta.

They did pro-rate for me and have always been very helpful, giving me some good deals and discounts. The fit for a truck is very tight and I would prefer longer hours but you can't beat the central location.
Surprisingly nice airport with helpful staff!! Flight landed early which was a bonus!!
Want to wish team HRR the very best. They are doing a great job. Finding a right location for my organisation would had not been possible without their help. Great going to team Osim and HRR
A very homey greasy spoon type place to eat joined to 44 truck stop. It's usually pretty quiet, they have free wi-fi, a couple tv's, and very nice waitresses. We're almost known by name down there by now, and our favorites are the burger and truck stop chips. I tend to be partial to the mini corn dogs and chili cheese fries, but there is also a wide array of home-cooked type foods. They've always got a good selection of cake for dessert. They run specials all the time too. If you're hungry in the middle of the night in this area, it's about the only place to go, but it really hits the spot.
Every sandwich is a winner! Never a disappointing lunch trip.
agradable alojamiento
This place was recommended to me by a fried. Good beer selection, quick and friendly service, and great food with reasonable prices. Will definitely visit again!

Not so bad
I live closer to the Panera on Indiantown Rd., but I much prefer this one on PGA. More generous with the dressing and salad ingredients, not giving me just a lot of lettuce. And for some reason, the sandwiches are better, too.

Motel 6 is not my favorite chain, but this one is a gem. Everyone is friendly and the room and the grounds were spotless. Staff was out every morning sweeping the sidewalk, parking areas and planted areas for rude people's litter and cigarette butts. The room smelled great when we entered - and it didn't have that Just Disinfected smell either. I plan to stay there again. When you consider the reasonable price, it's even better.
A good point to park in the old market town of Newark, easy to get about and shop safe, pay via cards or cash at the machines and card only if you pay as you go out at the gate.
Excellent customer service from the first call to the end ... Jen is a highly skilled technician with a delicate touch ... highly recommended.

Price value all here
For take-out, especially sushi, this is one of the better places around. The quality is very good for the price - be sure to order similarly priced rolls if you want the best 2-for-1 deal. Eating in at the restaurant isn't quite as appealing to me, as others have mentioned the service isn't very friendly. However I will say that the service is prompt and competent.
The Royal Albert is a beautiful pub in between New Cross and Deptford. Down the back they have an open kitchen where you can watch the chef cook up a storm. Up the front you will find some quiet corners where you can sit and play a board games or (occasionally) listen to a live jazz session whilst sipping your artisan beer of choice. Veggies beware the food is not particularly designed for you but meat eaters will love the gastropub menu available. #DavidBowieIs

Wings were delicious!!
I honestly have no idea what the other people are talking about. I eat here as often as possible and love the food. I wouldn't exactly call it upscale by any means, it's just a diner, and so you should expect the usual diner atmosphere (loud) and help (won't wipe your bottom for you), but man the food is good. The batter-dipped fries are the best around, and their sandwiches are great. Breakfast too.
A step above your average deli, this establishment focuses on vegetarian offerings, and good coffee. Their iced coffee is a real treat, especially when paired with the baklava. Their falafel is reliable as well.
The roast beef is hot and the beer is cold. The wings are pretty good too.

Hey Treasure Coast, SGA is all new with great food and a very nice atmosphere. Many weekly events and Special events as well. The new owners are awesome and always available. Even better is the staff, always friendly and ready to help suggest menu items. I have been there many times and always enjoyed myself. I would recommend you stop in and take a look and experience the difference. Tell them I sent you.
Great atmosphere for the family if you choose to dine-in. The staff and owners are very friendly and I love the tv's on the wall. If delivering, the ingredients they use are top notch and very fresh. The family size pizza is more than enough to last a couple of days for a family of four, and there's nothing like eating pizza the next morning when you're starving! They do tend to burn the cheese a little bit. It's not often, but every now and then it seems the pie gets left in the oven in a little too long. I love this pizza place, though, and feel it's a gem within Homewood.

They did a fantastic job. I need wall repair and paint, kitchen faucet replacement, and grout work. Everything was done well and they cleaned up after. They even proactively painted some other nicks on the wall that I did not specify. In addition, when the faucet did not work properly, they went out and got a replacement and installed it. I was very satisfied with their work.

Când am mers la ei eram destul de fixați pe niște idei dar, prin experiența și profesionalismul de care au dat dovadă ne-au ajutat foarte mult să ne (re)organizăm și am ajuns împreună la un rezultat final foarte bun. Dacă va mai fi nevoie, vom mai apela cu siguranță la serviciile lor și îi vom recomanda și altor persoane.

Went to Fitz's quite a bit, and generally enjoyed my experiences. There's been a few times that service was slow, or the food order's were incorrect. Things like that. Nothing too terribly drastic that you would take heed to resist the place though. I love their floats and the wraps. They have the best bottled soda around in my opinion. Definitely a place you should check out.
I had an apartment complex with tar/gravel that was leaking bad. Black Hills was pretty diligent about studying the situation and helping me think through my options. Ended up going with 80-mil TPO membrane. They did almost 6000 square feet in less than a week, and it's guaranteed for over 20 years. Looks fantastic. Price seemed competitive with others I checked. They could have done a little better job in cleaning up those nasty old through your shoes roofing nails that ended up on the lawn, and maybe guarding against stuff falling into my apartments below, but overall these things were minor in comparison with the job.

Me and my best friend, both very critical of food went. We were impressed. As for the decor. If you grew up in the gulf you know most crawfish places are outside on picnic tables. Not sure if I like the picnic tables inside. However, the food was great. We will go back.

VVC isn't a bad school. VVC is just as good as any other community college as far as education is concerned *went to Mt. Sac in spring 2003*. I'm not going to say VVC have a lot of the top tier connections like other community colleges such Mt. Sac or SMC (Santa Monica College). However, students transferring to four year colleges for academic or athletic purposes still attend good institutions like Ohio University, Kansas Wesleyan, CSU, and UCs. I can't say VVC doesn't have its flaws. One noticeable flaw are the people that hang out at the RAM center doing a whole bunch of nothing. The food court definitely needs an upgrade...BAD. The football field needs a huge upgrade. It's time for VVC to invest in a multipurpose field and stadium. Finally, I wouldn't mind seeing a bridge built over the lake. Sometimes it's a pain having to walk around the Lake to get to one class to the other. lol However, much of the flaws are due to lack of funding. At the end of the day VVC is what YOU make of it. I enjoyed my time at VVC by playing football, attending parties and clubs. To this day I keep in contact with former teammates and coaches from VVC. Upon transferring I was accepted into Azusa Pacific, Chapman University, Cal Poly Pomona, and University of La Verne. I chose to attend University of La Verne, thus allowing me to play an additional two years of football before graduating.
They Are Very Good ,And Have Good Products .
I really like this spot... the food is good, fresh and natural tasting no extra just good seasoning which I like.. they don't abuse salt like most places. The portions are good and their shop is clean...the 9 to 12 bucks you pay for a fried fish or shrimps with fries is worth it. Hope they maintain for a long time! Yum!

Un personnel vraiment attentif et charmant qui se rappele de vous quand vous revenez. Un excellemt rapport qualité prix et surtout restaurant ouvert tous les jours.
The food was awesome! Really good. The service down right pissed me off. If I wasn't on a date I would have gotten the management involved. I ordered the Diane, but since I'm on a low carb diet I asked to sub rice with broccoli. The server commented on how that was a good low starch option. I don't know who made the mistake (server or kitchen), but when my food came with broccoli and rice the server tried to make it seem like I didn't specify it as a substitution. I didn't say anything else because again I was on a date. This is obviously the server lying to cover the mistake because it was clear from previous conversation that he knew what I wanted. It was rude, dishonest, and condescending. I'll be back because the food was really good, but if I get the same sever I'll ask for a different one. He has red hair, a profound nose, and a beard.
I've never had roaches, or any other bugs. I've never had a problem with the staff or their policies. The gate works perfectly fine. Sometimes it gets broken and then it gets fixed. Top notch. Great community, staff and events for tenants. It's safe, peaceful and friendly here. The view and landscaping is incredible. Very pleased.

I was sat down and promptly greeted by my server. She took excellent care of me. They have this jalapeno cheese sauce that is brought out with the chips and salsa. This sauce is addicting! I had the vegetable enchiladas with the rice and beans. Very tasty. I loved the green sauce as opposed to the red sauce usually on enchiladas. The only thing that I wasn't crazy about was the house made flan. The "caramelized sauce" was nothing more than simple syrup poured over an overbaked custard, then topped with canned whipped cream. Otherwise, very good service, fun atmosphere, and overall, very good food. I'll definately be back.

Fantastic Food! I think it is slightly better than "Our Place" off of Macarthur. The only complaint - if this is even a complaint - is that I had to wait awhile to get my check. The staff is very pleasant; filling my table with naan and water ever 10 minutes. The food is rather spicy, but I'm pretty white. The desserts are amazing! I give it 4 stars, and hope to take my wife this weekend.

My experience at First Christian Church has been pretty good. I came here from San Diego and I began attending the Saturday evening service along with my wife before we got married. The atmosphere was informal (which I liked), and though the church was large, the atmosphere was intimate. The music was good, too. I'm a rock guy--always have been--and the music on Saturday evenings is not what you'd expect. It spoke to me powerfully and still does. I read the review at the bottom, and I'm very sorry that person had the experience they did. I have no idea who they spoke to that made them feel the way they do, or why those people said whatever they did to the person offended, but I want the offended person to know that not every person is going to make them feel uncomfortable. I don't know what kind of day the "holy" person they mentioned was having. I don't know anything about that person at all, but the truth is, that person could also have been anyone. It made me think about how it is I respond to people I don't know when I see them at church if they look different or act different than I do, or what I think people should act like at church. It's so easy to turn people away from God, and I never want to do that.

The steaks are excellent. The owner/manager I'm not impressed with. He greets and talks to everyone except us. I spent over $300 for dinner feeding my family. I have to give credit where credit is due. They have the best bone in ribeye I have ever had! I felt he could of stopped by and greeted us as he did everyone else. Given we are both people of color (Mgr and my family). I would hope he will make amends if I ever go back there.

I am a new bike owner. I went into Berts just to look around and see what's out there, since I had never been out in the bike market before. The salesman at the door, Kennedy was great, he was super helpful showed me around and didn't make me feel like a moron. I did some research, went back again to sit on a few more things and met a different salesman, Dino. My experience with him was not as enjoyable. He could tell I was new and was trying to do whatever he could to get me to buy his bikes, today. I told him my price range, and was immediately told that there was no way I could get a sports bike for $4,000. When I told him where I had already found some his tune instantly changed and he was willing to discuss a bit more. I however was instantly turned off. The prices at Bert's for me personally were just too high. I found what I liked, went to craigslist and found my bike there, for under $4,000. I would go back there to shop, but probably not buy unless the price was right. Now that I am smarter I am better prepared for the salesmen of Bert's Mega Mall, before I felt like I was being taken advantage of, especially by the second guy. Bert's is huge and they don't need my money, and they made that clear based on how I was treated, the first guy brought me back, the second guy helped make my decision to look elsewhere. Overall, Bert's is a great place to look, a great place to sit on a bunch of different things, and if you have the money a great place to buy. If you're new to the bike scene get educated and be careful, and if you have a strict budget, get real familiar with Craigslist.

A bit overpriced, but a cool little spot on Melrose.
Absolutely beautiful location. The visitor center is well cared for and the garden is serene (aside from the occasional passing train, but just work that into the experience and it's perfect the way it is.). Inside is a great collection of photographs and a replica of a typical worker's shack. I found the experience well worth the stop.
Good service. Creative menu.
If you are looking for a sold, traditional restaraunt then this is the place to go. We were greeted by a humourous waiter who was enthuisastic to serve us. He recommended wines which were excellent for the food we chose. He provided some great suggestions on local food specialties and we appreciated some complementary aperitif at the end of the meal. Service was excellent, food was tasty with good presentation, the setting of the restaraunt had a homely feel. Overall we had a wonderful experience at this restaraunt.

The bakery section is delicious, but the pizza...not so much.

In a world where people use Google as a forum to complain about everything, I figured I would buck the trend and say something positive. Our first trip to Jake's was today for Sunday brunch. The food was very good for a 15 dollar per person brunch. It had both breakfast and dinner items on the bar. Sunday all you can eat brunch and football on the TV, whats not to like. We will be back.
That's our kit

Such a cool, cool old school restaurant. Love everything about it -- except the prices. Definitely needs to be a special occasion. Awesome food and atmosphere though. Pro waiters - feels like a step back in time.
whenever i watch, Australian football at Woolloongabba stadium, my perfect spot for the crash would either this restaurant or a french one nearby by heading towards inbound from stadium (right above the subway tunnel). and a special compliment for the lady who, makes the dish hot.
Was surprised at how cheap it was. 2 chicken pho and 2 thai tea boba drinks came out to 9.50. There is a 10 dollar min for credit cards so we ordered 2 more drinks and the total came to 11.30. The food and drink was good. The pho was pretty plain, but they provide sauces at the table so you can flavor to your needs
Good food. Good times.
This "Y" is without any tension, Jezebels, and other uncomfortable common issues or people found in other Ys. You can get a decent workout without any hassle (with or without your kids). The staff is accomodating and that makes it worth it all. The other members that come there are decent people too. Two thumbs up definitely.
Must see place.
Arocon was quick to respond with questions and follow up. With the bad weather, they were in frequent communication letting me know where I stood in regards to their schedule and managed to get me in on the day promised. They also reattached my gutter that was falling while they were up there. Thanks Guys!

Not a fan of the food here, nor the menu in general. There are a couple good things, but as a whole, most of the selections are pretentious and overly done for a neighborhood tavern. The side salad is a great example of this. Not much in the way of "bar food" here, outside of the wings, which are awesome. Would love to see an updated menu with some comfort food type items like a bar pizza or mac and cheese or familiar appetizers in general. Avoid anything with chili, or any breakfast that includes eggs. The beer selection however, is awesome. The decor is also great, with plenty of TVs and just about any game on you'd want to watch. The service is hit and miss, although you soon learn who the friendly bartenders are, and who to avoid. Service on busy football Saturdays and Sundays is almost always really good.
Location thoda alag hona chaiye.
Darryl and his whole team are pros, I trust them with all of my landscaping work.
Si mangia bene, servizio efficiente e cordiale! Da non perdere!
Ah! I have been dying to go to Global Fusion since I had heard about it a couple of months back. Today was the perfect opportunity as it was a company sponsored lunch so I wasn't bothered about burning a hole in my pocket. But jokes apart, I must say I was not disappointed at all and it is as good as it was described to me by my fellow foodies! The place is huge & surprisingly even on a Monday afternoon it was bustling with patrons. Talking about the food, it was just yum. The spread is incredibly extensive and ranges from Japanese, Korean, Thai, Chinese, Malaysian & everything Asian! Especially the seafood preparations are delectable. I was spoilt for choice between the wide array of Sushi both veg (yes, veg sushi) & non-veg, salads, appetizers, tempura & dimsums. Honestly speaking I could not taste everything at offer! Only a superhuman can accomplish that feat. :) The sushi & sashimi were as close to authentic as they could get while the dimsums were perfectly steamed with moist & mildly flavoured fillings. The soups were totally yum (I had the chicken tom yum soup which was a delight) The starters that I could taste included Chicken Satay (tasteful, juicy, bite-sized chicken in peanut based satay sauce), Chicken Teriyaki (the best Teriyaki I have had so far), Tenderloin (finely sliced succulent crisp strips of tenderloin in a sweet & sour chinese sauce), Baked Prawns (whole prawns baked with some cheese topping, can't get better then that), a paneer starter (didn't bother about the name, but it was really tasty), a corn starter (again very good), a sweet & sour mushroom starter (the best of the veg starter options we tried), and a few more starters at offer. We couldn't help but call for multiple rounds of starters and were half full by the time we moved ahead! Besides these, they had a host of dimsums & tempura dishes at offer and they were as good, if not better, as you would get at an outlet at their place of origin! Then came the round for main course, which I must say was good for a Non Vegetarian but disappointing for a Vegetarian. If you are a vegetarian & not a big fan of stir fries, the only things you are left with is Hakka Noodles, Fried Rice, Steamed Rice & Red Thai Curry. But being a non vegetarian I had better options which included chicken, prawns, fish & crab (the crabs were really awesome) besides these! The desserts were okayish, with a few pastries, some interesting jellies, mud & cheese cakes, and ice creams from BR! All in all, it was a delight since I am a meat-&-seafood-lover! Ratings: Ambiance - 4.0/5 Service - 4.5/5 Value for money - 4.0/5 Food - 3.0/5 (Veg) - 4.5/5 (Non Veg) Overall - 4.0/5

Went to Hula Hut for a late dinner and was not particularly impressed by this lauded establishment. The service was at best average with only a single serving of chips + salsa being delivered to our table despite the original serving being devoured in minutes. I got the Fajita Beef Pipeline Enchilada, which was also average as far as enchiladas go. The cheese sauce was pretty tasty though. Just as a tip for our waitress: Don't tell someone that they can't order the shrimp quesadilla without cilantro because it's prepared ahead of time and is therefore only available as listed or with only shrimp + cheese. No one wants to hear that food is pre-made.

Lou Malnati's: Overall, good experience. Pizza is hand-made, quality, interesting stuff. The building itself is seemingly new with ample seating. If you want some good pizza at a cool place, Lou's is the place. See below for uber critical review and why it receives 4 of 5 stars. Critical Details: I am new to chicago style deep dish. Me and my buddy split a small(feeds 2) butter crust pepperoni deep dish. This "pizza" is special and takes decent time to make, so order early and get an appetizer for the 25 min wait. I put pizza in quotes in the previous sentence because it's not really like stereotypical pizza. The pizza is around 5-6 millimeters thick of actual bread, then gobbs of cheese. In fact, the cheese to sauce ratio was very high, around the order of 30:1(in grams) of cheese to sauce. When the pizza was first brought to the table and put on my plate I had no idea how to even attack the thing. As you dig in and start on the slice, usually from what would be the center of the pizza and then moving toward the crust, the pizza becomes exponentially tastier heading crustward. Using my fork, I whittled it down to the crust line plus 1/2 inch of flat pizza section. I then broke that section into 4 parts, and thats when the pizza really tasted best. The pepperoni was thin and I thought for a pepperoni pizza that there would be much more . Overall, especially since i'm new and open to the chicago style deep dish, I give the pizza itself a 7.5/10, as it could use more sauce for the amount of cheese, more flavor, and thicker bread. After the pizza(I had two slices) I was very, very full. This dense deep dish pizza really fills you up! Needless to say, the restroom was calling. The BEST part about the experience at Lou Malnati's was the bathroom. Yes I just said that, and MEAN it. Walked into the restroom, and fell in love. There was music, and it was loud! That is one thing many restaurant owners neglect, the music makes people feel much more comfortable to release a large load of feces without worrying if others heard/felt the seismic waves of the smell expansion, sound, and pressure differentials. The bathroom felt new, was very clean, and nice and small. The only complaint here was the fact that the toilet was too close to the wall, and the toilet paper dispenser was too low!! Like, is it that hard to mount the thing higher so you don't have to awkwardly reach down to get TP while your buttonhole/gooch area is still nasty?? Yeah, didn't think so. Overall, I give the bathroom at Lou's a 9/10, which is considerably higher than 95% of all public restrooms. Bottom line: GO TO LOU MALNATI'S!!! 4 full stars.

Excellent food for decent price. Awesome that it opens late for night owls
Very clean, plenty of room for a large party of diners
I just purchased a Corolla 2014 from Elmhurst Toyota through Patrick Finley. This was my first new car and the whole experience was excellent. I left with a feeling of immense satisfaction on the deal offered to me and my family is very happy with the car. We would definitely recommend this dealership for new cars to our family and friends. Thank you so much!!

Just like at home. If i were in Saun of the Dead, this is my Winchester. No other like it and i love every bit of it. I can bring my daughter here without worry of snotty service or weird things she can't/won't eat. Great place through and through.

Am petrecut 3 zile in acest hotel. Din punct de vedere al calitatii, pot spune ca depaseste cele 3 stele, camera in care am stat era spatioasa, curata, utilata cu cele necesare. Baia era de asemenea curata si fara probleme tehnice (usa baii insa lasa de dorit, se bloca de foarte multe ori, clanta acesteia cam subreda...). Serviciile hotelului sunt satisfacatoare in cea mai mare parte, cu minusuri pentru personalul de la restaurant care in timpul micului dejun este atent la fiecare miscare, nici bine nu imi terminam masa ca venea sa imi stranga farfuria sau ceasca de cafea, fiind nevoie sa rog sa mi se lase pe masa deoarece nu am terminat. (*Ca o paranteza, am mers prin voucher la hotel si trebuia sa avem inclusa o sticla de vin. Aceasta se afla in frigider in spatele altor sticle din minibar. Nu mi s-a parut corect faptul ca nu a fost lasata sticla la vedere. Practic daca uitam ca o avem inclusa in pret nu am fi avut parte de ea.) Per total sederea in acest hotel a fost foarte buna, cu cateva parti negative, peste care personal as trece si m-as mai intoarce cu alta ocazie. Il recomand!
Only went to the bar below. Very comfortable, great bartender named John. He was an awesome mixoligist!
We went in for a viola mute, and although they didn't have one, the woman called 4 other music stores trying to find one for us! We were blown away by that and have committed that whenever we need something we'll be going to Danman's Music. We also have several family friends that send their kids to Danman's and have nothing but great things to say about their teaches - in vocal, guitar and piano.
Esta muy bien atendido
Hammer Laden, nur leider fast immer voll. Essen ist super und Preise fair.
I love the food & the young employees are always great. Keep it up.
Nice place to watch the games and play NTN Trivia.
Su menú degustación es una autentica esquisitez.
One of the best and most friendly cafes I have been to. The breakfasts are great value and the homemade bubble and squeak was fantastic. Always leave happy and would highly recommend

My overall experience at this dealership was GREAT and I would refer anyone looking for a car to them because Freddie C & Jimmy both went far beyond their normal duties to help me and even though we had to back and forth with the banks the actual dealership was wonderful!!! They have helped me to start a NEW BEGINING CHAPTER in my life after an awful DIVORCE it wasn't looking to hopeful for me with buying a NEW car but THEY DID IT and I am SO THANKFUL TO ALL OF THE GUYS AT NORTH BRWD JEEP......GO SEE FREDDIE C & HE WILL GET YOU IN A CAR TODAY!!!!
Bryan from Home Heating came to do a clean and service and check on problems with fan turning on at proper time. He was very professional and gladly answered all our questions. He went through the through all the connections to see if there were any problems and made a few wiring changes to see if that would solve the problem. 2 of the 3 fusible links were bad and were replaced. He determined the problems may have been caused by the thermostat and recommended replacing it if I felt comfortable to do it on my own or he would be glad to do it but did let me know that it obviously would be a fair bit more expensive to have it done professionally. I appreciated that he would not try to push that it needed to be done by him for a price, if he thought it could be handled by the homeowner in most cases.

It is a bit overpriced here, but if you're looking for caps, jerseys, t-shirts, sweaters, hoodies, gloves helmets etc of your favorite team. This is prolly the only place in El Paso that has it all.
My Friend recommended taking Bikram Yoga so I searched online and this place seemed to be the studio with the most reasonable pricing as Bikram Yoga or any Yoga class is not cheap. I must say this is not a cup cake class but I will go again, I wish they had more night classes other than just Tuesday and Thursday so I could go more than twice a week.
OK a la carte lista, hinta/ laatu kohdallaan.

Although it's well established that the food at Pizza Villa is wonderful, lesser known perhaps is the fact that Cheryl Will is a longstanding and very active member of her local Central Pasco Chamber, is a tireless supporter of worthy causes and she collects $2 bills! A business with a 'heart'. I like that :)

Accidentally found myself in this cool watering hole on a late night in the cross. While it's only a stumble away from Kings Cross (literally across from the Coke sign), it's another one of Sydney's hole in the wall spots that serves a strong cocktail, dishes up a sweet ambience, and serves as a great point to kick on from, whether you're heading towards Shady Pines way or back towards the Coke sign - depending on how many cocktails you've had!
Fish was fresh. Sushi was very good. The only thing that I did not like about this place was the service. Didn't bring us any water at all. I'm really big on drinking water with my food.. Especially because soda is just not healthy and its $200 for a glass usually filled with more ice than soda. My bottom line regarding service is that my waiter be attentive and focus on our needs...WATER being something most Americans enjoy with lunch or dinner.

Clean and well equipped. Friendly staff. Knowledgeable personal trainers. Flexible membership terms. Program options are fairly spartan. Make sure they are offered at the times you are available. Would appreciate if all the TV monitors worked and were hooked up to all the equipment for all the stations. Would like to see daily yoga classes.

I have been going here for yrs. and never had a problem until recently when I used my cc to pay for our meal well I wasn't 100 percent sure we had enough so I ordered it online and it went through no problem and I got an email confirmation. However, I decided to go above and beyond by calling the restaurant to ensure that I did in fact have sufficient funds they assured me I did. So I got my delivery no problem until a hour later when both manager and driver knocked on my door to tell me I owed them money because my cc didn't go thru. Told the regular manager I did not have cash on me and he essentially threaten me and the driver yelled at me and my son was there to witness it all (he is 6 1/2 yrs. old and started balling) and told them I would pay them when my hubby got home and to get the hell out of my house. I called the district manager who was amazing and couldn't apologize enough and thanked her for her assistance with this but I would not be going back to this particular restaurant again to bad too we had been going for years.
Most award winning extra virgin olive oil of Turkey. Excellent vegan menu as well.

Invictis was a fantastic bar that was open when we needed them the most. The staff are extremely welcoming and friendly and the menu is great in both the bar and restaurant. Can't wait to go back!
I stayed there for over a month. I found the staff courteous and helpful, the room clean and well equipped, and generally had a pleasant stay.
Tout simplement les meilleures pizzas à emporter de la capitale, et sans oublier tous les autres plats de pâtes excellentes. Mais si vous mangez sur place, choisissez une table très loin de la porte d'entrée car ils sont victimes de leur succès. Ou optez pour emporter à domicile.
I had a Strep test which is very unpleasant because they swab your throat which makes you gag and it hurts. When the doctor swabbed my throat I naturally re flexed by grabbing her wrist tightly and pulling it back. She was very understanding although I did hurt her a bit probably. But they were all very helpful, comforting and, understanding of how distressed I was to have had Strep. Unfortunately it's been one month since and I have to go in again for Strep, luckily I think the doctor will be ready this time. P.S. to all you Soccer mom's out there with sick kids who go shopping and decide to touch everything which results in germs and viruses being spread...WASH YOUR HANDS! Because I wash mine and yet I'm spending Christmas sick and unable to celebrate it.

As tourists in Cuiaba with an outdated guide book and limited Portuguese, we turned to Google places for advice. Tiered of buffet style food we opted for the highly rated Japô Restaurante. We weren't disappointed. The waiting staff, with their limited English and our two words in Portuguese, were helpful and professional. The food was great too. A delicious Brazilian-Japanese fusion. Popular Square is a trendy place to be on a Friday night in Cuiaba and we managed to stumble upon one of the 'places to be seen in'.

The Thunder Bay Museum is a great museum. Wheelchair accessibility is pretty good with a ramp up to the front door and elevator inside to access the the other floors. My impressions with the museum is that, for a small city, it is a modest museum with a decent collection sure to be of interest to children and adults. They do have a small gift shop that is worth checking out as well.
Anoushka Bhatt was a little unfair as the owner agreed with her complaint and made her a free second one. The owner is so nice and often gives out a free coffee to very regular customers. Coffee is the excellent Drury Lane blend. Free Wi-Fi.

A great place in the city to get lost in on a rainy Sunday. Don't go here looking for a specific book, as you'll be disappointed. But definitely come here if you're just looking. A great place to find hidden gems, inspiration, and surprises.
The location is fine. Just be warned if you are an AT&T cell phone customer, you will not get service here. So if you're looking for a place where you can conduct business and take calls, this isn't it.
Good price vs other hotels/motels on the bay and was able to book a room for 1 night, last minute, without an upcharge unlike the bed and breakfasts. My wife also used an online coupon for an additional $10 off the quoted price. Staff was awesome, place was clean and updated.

Had a lot of fun at this place. The food is good, but nothing to rave about. Mostly it is the local color of the restaurant and the friendly service that you come here for. I really like coming here.
Great selection of shows for this size venue. The girls working the bar are quick to keep your drink full. You won't have a problem with the bouncers if you're not a problem for them.

Excellent food - well prepared - not overpriced. Improvises on traditional Indian style. Over priced in my opinion - will not survive with these prices. Music also a bit too loud.
Wow, Loved the store, great prices, good employees, the parking spaces are a bit tight so don't bring a van.
Great Customer Service, Great for family visits, great deals throughout christmas
Nice supercenter.
The Buddha is an icon in Fort Myers. It's still the ONLY true rock club in the area. It's not a restuarant, it's not a sports bar, it's not a cowboy club, and it doesn't have a buffet-line. They've got the area's best sound system and book top bands. Come to The Buddha if you want a great drink, poured by the area's top bartenders while you rock out. The Buddha is where locals go for great music, great service, and great drinks. You know what they say...go where the locals go! Drink, Dance, Rock Out... what else do you need?
Pacific Palace ia not a mall for Average Indonesians (maybe that's why they added Kidzania). The place is not so crowded on weekends, but if you're planning to go to Kidzania, came in the early morning.

It was very simple and easy. Damien helped us and was very friendly throughout the entire ordeal.
I have received wonderful service from Park 'n Fly. My most recent visit I was upgraded to covered parking without the additional cost. I thought this was kind to do! They are also prompt with getting us to the airport and picking us up. Very friendly staff.
Fantastic food and good decor. Indian Chinese food is good too. I feel it is much better than the much hyped food joint Bombay Chinese in Pt. Chev.
Went here for the Oh Snap! Festival and had a blast! Great outdoor space and you can get close to the bands and still be comfortable. Good drink prices and the people are friendly. I would recommend it to everyone I know !

The professionalism of the staff is a highlight. I have lived in Atlantic Beach since 2002 off and on, this is my favorite restaurant to bring friends to when they come in from out of town. The bar atmosphere is enjoyable while waiting for a table (they're usually pretty booked), there's a nice waterfront porch out back as well. Big thumbs up!
Far better than other cheating bunks in city.. Premium petrol will give better pickup and mileage..
A quaint little Bengali restaurant. Chops! try the chops.
Great service for hair colour and stylish, it's now my fixed place to trust my hair. Unfortunately extremely poor service for nails.
Flavorful food. Nice portions. A bit cold inside so bring a jacket. Never came here when run by previous management but the current, but current management seems good. I will definitely be coming back here again.
My wife and I went on our honeymoon and loved it! Food and service was great but the best part was the show! Brenton Keith & His Bag O' Tricks was amazing! Includes the crowd a lot and is quite funny.
Best place for REAL Hip-Hop in the city.

This hotel is CLEARLY not for everyone. I have stayed at hotels across the country from 1 star to 5 stars. I'd rather stay at Super 8's, Motel 6's, and such. Marriott was seriously lacking in the necessities department and they charged excessively for EVERYTHING. Parking...I'm a guest. I should have free parking. Internet...This is a business trip. Charging me for Internet? No Refrigerator...That means no fresh milk whenever I want it. Very aggravating. No Microwave...Fantastic. I don't get refrigerator, why would I have a microwave in my room? That's ok, for the price, they got to have one in the lobby where the continental breakfast is served...oh wait...no free continental breakfast. They charge for it. And no. There is no microwave in the lobby. Now, they do have a large work out facility which is nice. You don't find that it a lot of places. The staff was friendly and helpful enough. Maid service was more than adequate. My thoughts: For the price, they need to step it up and add the necessities. Microwave and Refrigerator and Free Wi-Fi are a MUST.

Always use drive-thru and don't believe I have ever had a mixed up order. Everyone always greets okay too. My compliant is the grilled sandwiches (breakfast). More often than not my breakfast sandwich is just bread with butter on it and the cheese is never melted. It would be nice to have that bread toasted as the picture shows on the menu board and cheese melted. Other than that, no complaints.
Nice fajitas in a family-heavy but margarita-rich environment. Nice outdoor bar area with tables. Warning: Don't call for reservations through Disney but rather call the restaurant directly if you want your reservation to get through.

Excellent food and service with classic personal style from classically uniformed crew of waiters, who bring your food to a separate serving table for final preparation. Quite expensive at ~70 CHF for dinner not including wine, but perhaps worth it considering the attention you get. I recall the waiter had to set an extra place for me and he precisely arranged each implement "just so" with a small smile. My osso bucco with pomme fritte was perfect. The green salad at 14 CHF is overpriced, with a dressing that I found too sour and salty. Everything else was good. Like all restaurants in Zurich, it is a bit loud when full.
Next to the great funny service from the owner of Pearl's Burger the food is very good. You can choose what kind of burger you want to eat, cooking style, toppings and even the type of cheese :) The fries they have, even we are from Belgium, are really tasty
I love this place, it's like a dine-in fast food experience but with asian food. Hainanese chicken rice is so fresh and light, beautifully steamed chicken every time. The laksa is superb too. You can't complain with great service and very cheap pricing. It's not somwhere to sit for a long lunch, but for a short, quick lunch with really good food - highly recommended.
Small place with big attitude. Food was great, service was fast and the server was nice. It feels like a small corner restaurant but the food was damn good! I highly recommend it and id return if I lived in this part of the U.S.
Very nice Church, but the most important is the people. I went a couple times with my family and not too much sensible with persons. It was many experience, but I think so its a good church.
Non-keralites say, its the best airport. Unlike other airports, you dont have to travel hours to reach somewer to find hotels or restaurants. Everything is available right outside the airport and yeh lotsa greenery and golf course nearby...good one except for facilities...
Cabin was clean. Owners were nice. New bath towels and a couple little extras and this place would be perfect.
love it.
Super fun love all six flags
Food is totally awesome. specially the sekh kabab and the saag chicken. Will definitely visit this place again
I Love Loni... But It's Just Personnal... I Recommend You Dan Thompson Who's a Wonderful and a Pleasant Teacher... I Will Come Back Later to Tell You More about That Wonderful Place... Take Care and Enjoy...
I was a tenant with Premier and was very pleased with them. When we moved in there were several issues at our house one of which being mold. This was at no fault to anyone since it was up in the attic which is not normally part of a move out inspection from a previous tenant. The mold was due to a loose exhaust vent from a bathroom fan which caused venting in to the attic creating moisture. They responded right away to remedy the issue and notified the owner of the house. There were other minor repairs that needed to be done and those were taken care of in a timely manner as well. Before our lease was up we had a family members house become available. Linda was very willing to work with us to find another tenant to move in to the house right away. There was a smooth transition and no lag in rent income for the owner. We left the house free of needing repairs and clean. We were not penalized for breaking the lease since there was no loss to the owner or Premier. I would recommend them for both owners and tenants.
Very good and fast delivery. Went in to see whats so special abt taco bell. But i dont think i will be going there anytime soon. Service was good and fast. Burrito was good but it tasted lke a combination of south indian(rice) and north indian (roti) alng with small slices of chicken. Always i wanted to know whats so special abt nachos they were so exp,I still dont know the answer for that. If u lile soft drinks though u will like this place. Unlimited soft drinks of ur choice.
Ótimo local para descansar em Jacumã/PB.
This place is just amazing.... do yourself a favor and go hang out there on a Saturday afternoon/evening. Drink some great local beer. Eat from a great local food truck (Kokyu!). Play some cornhole... What more do you need?
I show up to Dunkin Donuts every morning and get the exact same thing. The people are very friendly, however, whether or not I get the right order is hit or miss. The problem is always my coffee. I ask for the caramel swirl coffee everyday. I look forward to it. They don't put in the caramel swirl half the time. If there was another DD close to my work, I would go there because this is ridiculous. Especially when I repeat that I want caramel swirl, they act exasperated because I said it a second time, and they still forget to put it in the coffee. It is not a complex coffee order. It is a matter of putting the syrup in a cup and pouring in the coffee. I have not gotten my caramel swirl coffee in a week. I finally decided to review them. My take on the establishment: great people, but check your order because it probably won't be right.

My husband has his hair cut here and so we brought our 18 month-old in - they did a great job on his first cut and were swift!
I hired them to do a carpet cleaning after I found out they were cleaning the carpets at my office, which always look impeccable no matter how many customers have walked on them that day. The cleaner arrived almost on time, which a tiny delay of about 10 minutes, but I didn't mind. What I hadn't foreseen was that the service we use at the office is in fact a dry carpet cleaning and the one I ordered was just an ordinary one so I ended up with completely soaked carpets. I had to wait almost a day for them to dry out and couldn't set foot in my living room the whole day.
Hotel looks nice, prices are too high, the water features in the spa were out of commission our entire stay. A free complimentary breakfast as replacement would have been nice. At least the front desk warned us of the cost of breakfast, she suggested going to a cafe to save big euro.
Great store. Clean good customer service and dedicated team of employees.
nice bar close to best western hotel. music, darts and beers. all good.
Cocktails are the best!!! Most extensive menu of mixed drinks I have ever gazed upon.
Schöne Anlage mit viel Möglichkeit sich zu bewegen. Inlinerbahn rund ums Rabet und allerlei Spielplätze sind vorhanden. Is nett hier.
I'm not a lover of Chinese meals, but those from Everest are nice enough to eat. One issue I do have is the Beef. It is always under cooked, and takes effort to chew. As a family run restaurant, the atmosphere, and friendliness of the staff, is excellent. Although the restaurant is usually empty of customers, and the decor is simple, do not let this put you off having a meal there. A quiet meal for two would be ideal.
The service and staff are excellent. The customer satisfaction department is second to none. They solved both of my issues very quickly.
In terms of 'star theatre' as movie hall i wl give it 5/10 only because of its online information facilities.....but there is a nostalgia effects as its the place where the great Girish Ghosh had performed 'Noti Binodini'.....apart from that, roof top food court, an awesome place to spend some special quality times with your loved ones.....also its an ideal destination for hanging out with friends......the ambience is very good....but avoid suuny weather.....

I like the place. Had a pizza, salad and a flight of beers. Cozy and unhurried there. I'll be back.
Great food. Great service. Pretty small dinning room though, made it pretty hard and a long wait for a table.

I believe because it's located in the heart of Chicago is the reason for the high prices. However the atmosphere makes up for that!
Ein sehr gutes Hotel in einem wunderschoenen Tal, nahe an der Piste. Einfach perfekt zum Entspannen und Regenerieren.
Best Sweet sumptuous Honey ribs...! The other kind!!
Of course we went there for wings! Got the mild version and they were very tasty. Not cheap, but the sauce was very good. Certainly not a gourmet atmosphere, but we'll be back, next time we're in the area.

A lot of people may come here because of a court order; but the service they provide to the community is truly priceless and should be given more recognition. Very few establishments promote mental health in the Latino community, and this place is changing lives.

Tried it for the first time two weeks ago and have already gone back! Our dinners were delicious and properly spiced (my lamb vindaloo had the degree of hotness I like). On our second visit we tried the cherry, raisin naan and although I was skeptical at first, I did really enjoy the flavors. We will be going back for dinner and I want to try the buffet sometime. I recommend this place without reservation!

Su decoración de estilo rústico regional es muy buena. Su comida igual
Just a normal pawn shop, with alot of stuff crammed into a small place.
It's often been said that Sungai Wang Plaza is the bellwether of the economy. If things are going well for businesses in Sungai Wang, all's OK in Malaysia. It's central position makes it important, and for some time it was the most important shopping centre in Malaysia. Make sure to eat at the maidan selera on the 4th floor; it's still great, after all these years!

Best Hotel in Manipur......can get good north indian food
The menu is well crafted and the food is fantastic and well cooked. Wine list is great too.
Whole foods offers a convenient shopping experience. With a variety of prepared food great for meals on the go. Whole foods has a large selections of cultural/international brands and products that are sometimes hard to find in one location. It can be pricey and the lines are long but do move quickly. Check out their website for recipe ideas.

My ratings are particularly concerning their basil salmon roll... When you go there, get that item. It will be like taking NZT (from limitless) for the first time. basil salmon roll -> write it down Have fun!
If you get a soda ask for no ice because you only get one free refill after that. Want more gonna pay for it

Some of the best fried pickles I've ever had. Great locals place. Service a bit slow, but food and friendliness worth the wait. Unfortunately, cannot get a wheelchair in the front door (didn't try the back). Clean and restroom was very clean. Very accommodating to my vegetarian friend. Home made potato chips on the table first thing were excellent. Large beer menu -- I'll be back for dinner to sample some. Really good crabcakes, too. Yum!
The owner come from Rochester NY. They brought with them some of my hometown favorates. Beef on weck and the Plate. I come here all the time. They have a car show once a month, it's fun to see everyone gather to have a good time.
Great Reliable place. Food is always enjoyable. Nice to always see the owner. Hard to get there in the summer...not their fault
Great scene

First time eating here. Food was fantastic. Husband had ribeye steak. I had chicken alfredo. Both meals were fantastic. Our waitress was great. The restaurant is in a older building but the decor is bright ,happy,and clean. We didnt get to try their desserts because we were stuffed. So pleased with the low prices for the amount of food we got. We will definantly be back.
We love Abe's it's our all time favorite restaurant. Got great service on Friday night by Scott. He was very attentive and one of the best waiters we've had in awhile. Highly recommend Abes!

VERY happy with Dino's!! Low cost but GREAT food. Just move to NC and we are so happy there is a local delivery place with such great food at such a low cost and NOT just another pizza place. Will be ordering from here many, many more times
Very happy with my website and the return on the investment

The Myakka River is a beautiful backdrop for this campsite. The folks behind the desk at check-in, check-out are fantastic! However, campers are almost on-top of each other whether in a tent, trailer or RV. While the few tent-only sites face the water, there is no privacy there, as folks park their lawn chairs on the other side of the water to fish all-day-long and watch you. Alcohol is permitted, which seemed to be the catalyst for 6 middle-aged, extremely disruptive campers to pound beers both Friday and Saturday nights (nobody is at the site to keep campers in-check)...enough to make me never want to return to this campground. I had complained at the front desk Saturday morning which didn't change anything, as the misbehavers did not alter their inconsiderate behavior for their fellow campers the second night. I went to chill out for the weekend and returned home frustrated and angry I wasted my time at Camp Venice Retreat.
It's not a fancy place, but the food here is always hot and fresh and the people who run the place are wonderful. It's a pretty popular place, though, so it can get pretty crowded (particularly on Friday evenings around 5PM).
Love the pizza pasta specials they have in winter and the generous (and free) bread and chili paste you get on the table when arriving. And sitting in the walled courtyard in the old Cape Quarter.
Those attempting to plan a private event beware: I called three times and the sole person responsible for contact for planning events never returned my calls. There was no other manager or planner available to help. I could never get any information from Lindey's staff about event planning apart from having a message taken and never receiving a call back. Very unprofessional handling of this matter and quite surprising given the caliber of the restaurant.
Great prices....

Great hotel, about £35 a night. Lovely staff, big room. Mark down one point because of road noise. Be aware that this hotel is about 20min drive from central chandigarh
Bästa Chicken cashew jag ätit i Sverige. Rekommenderas verkligen!
Needed my sigma lens to be autofocus adjust so I left them with my lens and camera. They had it over the weekend. Everything went smoothly and fine. I'm only giving them 4 stars because it would've been nice if they actually called me to let me know my gear was ready. I had to call them.
Ultimate in backpacker hostels. Amazing hosts and it's based directly off the beach. Perfect for a holiday on holiday.
Didn't even know Slackwater existed until after playing with Google+ local. The food was great, and the beer selection was... greater. Best beer selection I've seen in Ogden. We ended up going with the "From The Earth" pizza. Their banana, peanut butter, nutella, dessert calzone hybrid was awesome too. We'll definitely be going back.
Universal Journeys is always proving to be a great travel and touring company. We made a family tour trip with the help of this travel agency. It was a very nice experience with them. The whole team was very cooperative and helped us to make our decision right. We would like to recommend this tour agency to all our friends.
Inredningen är mycket rustikt, kanske lite för mycket så. Maten är väldigt god, med utsökta möjligheter till privata varianter.
A very nice place to visit and see Yerevan from top.
The Bellevue office is about a 30 minute drive for me but it's worth every minute behind the wheel. Everyone that works there are extremely nice and courteous. The ladies at the front desk are great and even helped my wife keep my 3 year old entertained during my visits. Chris, the office manager is great about explaining the treatment plan to you and will help you in any way possible to get everything he can covered by your insurance. The ladies in the back are very sweet and caring and will make you feel totally comfortable even if you're absolutely terrified of going to the dentist like myself. Dr. Rose and Dr. Dan are the two best dentists in Tennessee! I'm not just saying that to be polite in a review, I'm trusting them with $40,000 (before insurance thank goodness!) in dental work to repair my teeth that were in absolute horrid shape from having to take antibiotics for an extended period of time because of a motorcycle accident and it literally ruined my teeth. So you can take my word for it, you won't regret making these guys to go to people for all of your dental needs. They will give you a beautiful smile that you can be extremely proud to show off! They can take care of everything from routine cleanings to same day crowns (CEREC) to dental implants to replace missing teeth and if you're scared of the dentist, Dr. Rose is even able to do conscious sedation and you'll never even hear or feel those dreaded drills! I'm actually smiling for the first time in over 20 years instead of trying to hide my teeth. Don't take my word for it though. Go talk to them, meet them, and find out for yourself! You'll be very happy you did!

I agree with those who enjoyed both the food and the atmosphere. Unfortunately, however, I also agree with those who were put off by poor service. The owner is very friendly and well meaning, but seems to fail to realize that his patrons expect faster service. I mean we had to wait a LONG time, putting us in a difficult situation with our gracious babysitter. Bottom line: take your wife, have a good time, IF you don't mind waiting a long time for your food and drinks. The place is excellent if you don't mind hanging out for a long time. Enjoy the live music while you wait, it's pretty good. And I also echo those who said try the flaming cheese.
I had heard good things about this place and after having tried it a few times I have to say I'm kinda disappointed. The Vaca Frita was extremely dry, almost to the point of being inedible. I might go back to try the walk-up window because everything I saw there looked really good but aside from that I doubt I'll be eating here again.
Tennis, skating, football and play ground. Yay fun.
Great place and staff.

Service and atmosphere is great here. Though it does get annoying when i have fireworks in my face 10 times throughout the hour that im there. I also wonder about their cooking ability in some dishes. For example , every time i have gotten the vodka riggies(which has been atleast 5 times hoping it gets done right) it tastes just like they poured it into the dish and never cooked the vodka into the sauce. I wanna taste flavor in my pasta not have a shot of it. Other dishes there though are amazing.
I had one of the best blueberry muffins that i can ever remember eating at the 109th street location. And i always really enjoy getting an iced latte to go, cause its good, and i love it. KEEP ROASTING BEANS. AND IMPORTING THAT CRAZY NORWEGIAN HOPPY BEER PLEASE!

Nice food
Very nice staff
I really like Altamont Gardens, just outside Tullow in Carlow. I only rate it 4 out of 5 because I think it's a total shame that the house is not open to the public. Aside from that it's a great place to relax and stroll around. Beautiful gardens any time of year.
So at first sight, I didn't like the area that the place was in. But the inside was much better than the outer appearance. I really can't complain the washers & dryers were the newer up to date ones. I actually put way too much money in the dryer it dried my clothes in half the time I expected. And I had blankets & towels in there. Awesome!
First time here. Stumbled on it. Very pleased! Service was great!

Really liked it, wan'st that busy during the week. And they have garden at the back with additional tables.
My burger was great and the atmosphere was pretty cool. Also hard to beat a place that serves "boozy shakes and malts."
I haven't used this Realty yet, but I have flipped through their catalog and they have beautiful homes for rent. Nothing like visiting the OBX! It's my favorite place in the world.
Best villa with private pool. Really worth for family with kids. May be service will improve with time. Some issues here and there but the resort is worth.
The food is gross, the rent is affordable, the rooms are small. The place is filled with young interns, mostly from germany. The position is fantastic and you get a good place to stay. Everything is clean.
The staff in this Starbucks are the friendliest I've seen.

Overall we were pleased with our visit to Luccas last night. We started with their higher end, $32, Robert Mondavi Cabernet (meh), followed by the garlic parmesan wings, which were crispy and tasty. For our pizza, we tried the Margherita and the BBQ Chicken. Both were very good. Service was somewhat slow, but the place was hopping, so no worries, and the waiter was very responsive. The atmosphere is fine and everybody was friendly. My only advice would be to bring your own wine and pay the $10 corkage fee, rather than drink what they stock. We'll be back!

I'm really fussy, but the meal I had here was very special. Highly recommended.

Altid tilfreds med service og maden er skam fanatstisk
Bardzo dobre sushi! Byłem z 15 razy i nigdy nie podano mi niczego nieświeżego. Być może komuś się trafiło, ale jest to zdecydowanie wyjątek. Pyszne jedzenie, tylko troszkę nieudolnie przygotowywane, bo np. hosomaki i futomaki strasznie się rozwalają i niestety trzeba często jeść je palcami...
Our dog Zoe had injured her leg. She was favoring it, but we didn't see an instance that would cause her to start favoring her leg. Called one 24 hour place near us and they were not helpful at all. Clearly just interested in having us come in and give them money. Called Animal Specialty Group and Suzanne was extremely helpful. She talked us through all the possible scenarios when we gave her the symptoms. She was very forthright and helped out a lot. I understand that there is a liability issue and no one wants to make a diagnosis over the phone because the only way to be 100% sure is by bringing the dog in. But unlike TLC Pet Medical on Santa Monica, this place would at least talk to you on the phone about the issue and discuss your options. Their obvious care for the pet and the pet owner would make me drive the extra distance to visit their clinic over the one only a mile away.
the movie i see.it's wonderful.
This is my favorite place to direct people
Target is better than Wally World, it's neat and clean, organized. This particular one is just a tad bit short on the availability of floor staff... however they are very considerate
Burger is very tasty and just like other places in the US, the serving is quite huge (to Asian standards).

The variety of coffee and food you get here is really good. The best part is that coffee is cheaper than other places with similar quality and level of service.

Sea World is great for a nice get-a-way with your family. There are mainly show attractions to view. Its only 2 roller coasters so don't expect much there
Had a problem with my cell phone battery and they didn't have the replacement in stock. They did however spend 20 minutes fixing my phone and got the battery to actually hold a charge so I didn't need to buy one. Says a lot about a place when the people there are really motivated to help versus just trying to make a sale. They will be my first stop from now on for anything that they carry.

have been at Saint Hill and that area came over like a peace wind. Quiet, very nice maintained. people treated me very friendly. Good coffee and cakes, seerene. My own experience. No hassle, no money burglars, no electro shocks, no bandages, no torture to me. I liked it very much.
Went to the restaurant upstairs, which was nice and quiet, compared to downstairs which was heaving. Quality pub food.
Crabby Patty and Falalfel are a must. Highly recommend Blind Bob's. If you're looking for a great atmosphere and great bar food, check it out... Have 5 beers on draft, not a big selection but they rotating frequently.

Seems real nice. Greens were in nice shape as were bunker sand considering it is a Par 33. Figure on a dogleg par 4 that is 285 to the green over water and big trees. Stayed at Holiday Inn next to it and for $9 (senior over 55) + cart for $7, looks to be a nice quick 4 iron and PW get out and get around.
Decent place though expensive
I have tried them in the past in Vegas. The first time I ate at the new location in Austin, I was underwhelmed. I thought it was not as good as in the past. This most recent time I thought it was really good. They might have worked out the kinks since the opening. It is a good fast food burger. Take that however you want to take that. I like their fries and it's cool they serve sweet tea here. I do not like P. Terry's and think they are a ripoff of In-N-Out. I will be back.
Food was great, service excellent and fast. Jarrod was our waiter and he rocked, very fast and attentive. Music was good rock and roll, not too loud...just right. Menu is typical greasy food faire, but well prepared and very tasty. We hit thunderbird's on our way out of town and definitely would recommend it.

I stayed here a month after returning from a deployment while integrating with work and finding a apartment. The staff was excellent with a good clean crew once a week. The building and facilities are older and there were a few minor issues like the toilet getting clogged (a quick hit with the plunger and it worked great the rest of my stay). The exercise room was a bit lacking (only cardio stuff) but everything worked. You can somewhat hear the other tenants especially if they are being loud. No bugs anywhere which hasn't been the case with all extended stay places I've been to. The price was amazing $47.99 a night which is hard to beat for the area especially at the last minute. The place was very safe. I totally recommend this place if you need a place to live out of temporarily while looking for something more permanent or for buisness travelers on a week or longer short term job.
I've had a pleasant experience so far with Storage Kings on 290 west. Unit was cleaned, office staff was friendly, and paperwork was quick. Found it easily on Google Maps (new to the area), and facilities seemed clean and safe.
Went on Christmas Eve for a birthday meal good value for money.bush tucker trial good fun
Great BBQ! I've had most of everything on the menu and all of it was really good. The pulled pork and the brisket stand out. Great portions did the money also pretty good sides. Forget Wallabies and head to Smoking Apple or 5 Star BBQ on Geneva both are excellent.
enjoy n relax
Good setting, friendly staff, decent pub grub but a little way from exceptional. Disappointing that our first choices had sold out and slow to top up our empty drink. For a less costly, less formal alternative to City food, well recommended.
It's good place to enjoy & hang out with friends. Though the mall is under maintenance but still you got few good options as Mcdonalds where you can have a movie with snacks makes a complete party pack. Screen's good, Sound not that great but good value for the money spent.
THe property that this company manages is in good hands. I have several properties around and I always like to tip my hat to the good ones when deserved. They've earned it.
Great jazz club, when les paul was alive he would play here all the time on mondays! Now the jazz club recognizes him and the amazing man he was by dedicating mondays to him and his music. The food is always great and they have a lime gin and tonic that is amazing. Also i would recommend to get any of the appetizers. The shows are also a good price, always a fun night

A wonderful place to stay with your family, next to colva beach and all the things that a family may think of while planning for a holiday are here. An exquisite property maintained amicably with high ambiance and best part is staff is cooperative beyond imagination. Rooms & Dining Area: To start with room was neat and tidy, Room service was good, hot running water 24 hours, dining area/in-house bar on first floor, with opening towards sea gave a wonderful view. Pool Area: Pool Area had sun bath beds, clean water with available attendant during pool open timings and was neatly maintained. Food: Good as felt like home. Health Club: Feel need to do some improvement here, adding more machines, Otherwise basic machines for cardio are available. Ayurvedic Massaage: Available at Hotel but did not try. Ambience: Excellent, No match No comparison. Overall: Excellent place, loved the resort, visiting again in Feb 2013 and have pre-booked my room in same hotel.

Not many choices for pizza in the area, but Trail Rider is definitely good pizza!
My wife and I ate there last week, our server, Cammi was outstanding. The place was very busy but she still managed to make us feel like the most important people in the restaurant. The place was loud, and very busy but the food and drink was very good we look forward to going again.
Great Doctor! Someone is always available to help. They are also technology friendly and I can book appointments, get referrals, and refills via email!
Found this place last minute and was able to book a room online. They accept Google Wallet so booking online was very easy. The Hotel Owner was very nice and patient with me when I decided to change my reservation from one two nights to one. The owner also furnished an iron and board on request. The location is great because it's in downtown Eureka. As far as the exterior goes it looks cheap and the inside of the room is small. The neighborhood seems to be a bit rough around the edges and I saw a few people sleeping in the street. Other than that it's a good spot to crash after a 10 1/2 hour drive.
Good atmosphere. Food was great.
Nice little park. Not too many trails but plenty of not so dense woods to explore. Park stretches front a beautiful overlook on the Susquehanna down the river shore.
Service good need to open earlier and serve food fastr is recomended
This place continues to provide wonderful and prompt service.

I love it here! The seats are a little bit worn out and have some miles on them. They do a good job of keep the bathroom descent. The movie sometime will flicker maybe once or twice, and I wish the sound was more surround....but again 2 bucks. $2 for a movie...can't beat it. I use to do the $8 theaters...not anymore! No more "I PAID $8 FOR THAT" mistake.

My 6-year old saw people with Lego bags and justly assumed there must be a Lego Store somewhere in the city. We asked around and when we arrived we were greeted with large lego structures of animals and characters. As far as product goes, they have a great deal of collections and sets and even a "pick-a-brick" section where you can fill up a cup with as much as you can for $15. We enjoyed ourselves. It's worth finding even if you don't have kids just to gawk at the large structures.
Loved the setting. Food & Service were great.
Stumbled accross and found the biggest lasagne yet. Tres bon.
Good pizza, did not skimp on the ingredients. Not a complaint, but the crust is chewy soft all the way through, and I do prefer a bit of a crunch to the crust with a soft center. (perhaps brush with olive oil or sprinkle with water). But that is just a texture preference. It is more pricey, but you get what you pay for. You want cheap go to little ceasers and get a crust made from the same material as the box it comes in.
Excellence price, good movies, but sometimes the facilities are lacking.
Cliff was great, really makes you feel comfortable. I liked the combo of massage by hand, hot rocks, and tuning fork. Personally loved the hot rocks.

Without question, the best Italian restaurant in the area. The absolute definition of a diamond in the rough. It's hidden away in a crummy little shopping center, the decor is inconsistent, the lighting is dark (which I don't mind, but I know that's not typical), and at first glance, you wouldn't think much of it. The food though, is beyond compare or reproach. I've been all over the country (and outside as well), and this place still has the best pizza I've ever had. Their pasta dishes are superb, their service is friendly and prompt, their prices are reasonable...it's basically everything you could want in an eatery. If you're visiting and pass them up, or have lived here and somehow never been to Cosimo and Suzie's, you're only cheating yourself.
Tequila runs a great place to see bands. More venue than museum.
Our kids had the best time here and thoroughly enjoyed it. The prices are very reasonable but make sure you get discount tickets, this saves you about 20% on each ride.
Hours for the DMV is 9-6 m-f. And 9-2 on sat
Went in to watch a soccer match, the waiter was really nice and attentive. We had the pork egg rolls they were really good. I like it because it's in the heart of boystown, you get to see everyone walk by if you seat by the window.
I found my experience at Pell City's RadioShack to be very shocking! I thought that because of the ages of the employee's I would not get very much information on the products I was looking to buy. I found that the 2 young females were very helpful. They not only new what I was looking for but had information to help me get the best out of the product's I was buying & even one I already had. Even though one of the items I wanted was out they had another one that was the exact product just a different style which I was ok with going ahead and purchasing. Thanks girls for such great work.

Very nice people who are interested in building long term relationships with their customers. Several times I have had a problem with a recumbent trike I bought from them, and the always been very helpful and seemed much more interested in getting me back on the road than making a buck. They also worked with the manufacturer when I had a warranted failure of the frame. I didn't have to do anything, they took care of it all. Great folks and very UNPRETENTIOUS!

Very good rubin sandwich
The second best pizza I ever had. I couldn't resist keeping eat 4 pieces.
Good all around place! We get food here often!
Rooms are nice and cozy. The service is decent. The menu is quite diverse and the food is really good. A good enough place for a short stays.
Great offers but still quite expensive. Staff fantastic 12/10/2013
love the food hate the website is not helpful at all the food is really good but u have to go in or call them so u can figure out what u goin to eat website is not helpful at all
Very nice park to see both white n black rhino.
The atmosphere is great! This is a great place to go for desert on a date! The coffee menu is VERY impressive, and the desert counter is to die for! The prices are very reasonable for the quality!
I enjoy taking my children to the small town theater. It is nice to have something close and very enjoyable.

Only a 45 minute drive from Portland, this is one my favorite places in the Gorge to go and relax for a weekend. For less than $30 a day you can soak in a mineral pool, swim, take a nap, read a book and feel so good afterwards. I love their lobby and beautiful fireplace - it is nothing fancy but it sure is relaxing! Well worth the stay
One of the better Park & Ride lots, employees are friendly and courteous. will keep on using.
The environment is great. The fantastic building provided great atmosphere for the excellent performance of Much Ado About Nothing we saw here. It's worth spending the extra £1 on a seat cushion though!
Good IKEA, not as busy or big as the Etobicoke Ikea, but that is almost a benefit. They have the main important products. Staff are good, and I have typically been able to find parking not a mile away most of the times I have gone.

Bonnes quantités/qualité pour le prix. Service drôle et agréable.
Very cheap hiring and easy to get things' one down side is there website does not have the products on it so you need to phone them and ask them what they have and if it is in stock. Otherwise they were easy to deal with.
Lo maximo
I would echo others' comments on entrance needing a little work, getting fit walking those stairs and the fast internet. The internet did not work immediately, but the owners and the unit's contact person were quick and very responsive in getting it up and running. It was much appreciated given I was there on business. (great location for getting to Austria Centre).
Worst coffee I've had in my life.
Update: Service seems to be back in good shape. Food is still well worth it. I used to be a big fan - tonight when I went for dinner, I had an awful experience. They filled two large to-go orders for customers who ordered *after* me, and when they did bring food to my table they got one item right. Out of five items, they got one right. This is unacceptable service.
Nice clean rooms, friendly front desk and pretty nice professional staff all around. The grounds are beautiful. The pool is super warm and welcoming, my kids LOVED it. I would stay at this hotel again, no problem.
If youve come this far, then do make it a point to visit phoenix market city, just across the road.

Good Stuff!
Food always consistently hot & tasty! My fav is corned-beef hash & eggs, w/ wheat toast. This place is a keeper! Laura is the best ;)
Jason and Gene were easy to work with. They gave a fair value for our trade (higher than trade value on KBB) and also gave a fair price on our new Acadia. Finance didn't push us when we said we didn't want any of the add-on's. Will return for service and will post another review at that time. Overall a good dealership that offers good pricing.
Old is gold
Best spring rolls in the city! Rare beef soup is fantastic, love the broth!
Great lunch prices...!!!
This place has good pizza. It takes about 30 for it to be made although its worth it. The drinks were not that good honestly. It looked dumpy inside, total ghost town, surprised this place is still running. Might need a heath inspector or something, this place looked dirty. I should have got my order to-go.

I'm a current resident here and it very good considering the price and location. The grounds are kept very clean. I see cleaners cleaning the halls, steps, and laundry room every day. Front office is nice and respectful. I only have two real complaints. Maintenance doesn't show up with any urgency. Also the surrounding area about two blocks away is pretty shifty. So far I have enjoyed my residency and plan to resign my lease when the time comes.

Admission TB100 adult. Nicely set out, lots of info boards, plenty of aquaria for different species. The walk through tunnel was a disappointment (after Aquaria KLCC, no tunnel compares, sorry). We also followed the nature trail down to the turtle pools. What we liked best was the hatchery - a short walk from the main building. Where fish are being hatched & bred before being returned to the sea. Got better views of some than in the aquarium. Also several pools growing corals & anemones to assist with colonisation: fascinating! Nice little restaurant - Sawsadee Restaurant & Bar - just along the road. Varied menu, not too pricy. Immaculate toilets. Visited April 2013

Nice place with very good food. A little more expensive but well worth it.
I've been coming here since mid-late 80's. Food is always excellent. I have to say though, went there this morning, and they evidently have some sort of sewage issue. It was very overpowering, and ultimately ended up leaving. Reminiscent of a port-a-potty in the sun, mid August. Hope they get this resolved!

Found this shop when searching locally for Kayaks. I wasn't originally in the market for an inflatable but the guys were great helping my wife and I get what we needed. Prices were great as was selection. Wished they had a showroom rather than just a local pickup option, but great nonetheless. -M
Неплохой клуб
The appointments due tend to run a little behind, so I never really count on getting in exactly at my scheduled time... Everyone is very nice. They don't hold you down and force floss you like some dentists I've been to. My first visit was due to an abscess caused by a degraded wisdom tooth... Thanks to them, I finally gave in and agreed to getting all the dental work I'd been putting off for close to 10 years. I had all 4 wisdom teeth pulled, a full periodontal cleaning, and 8 cavities filled in just under 3 hours, all while completely asleep for most of it (I was woken during the fillings to give the anesthesia time to wear off so I could walk). They really know how to educate you about their procedures and the best way to do things to avoid complications. The best part was that I was in no pain the next day and was even out running errands with no swelling. It would be nice if they would work with more insurance companies and discount dental programs to make their practice and option for those of us more financially pressed, but there are a variety of payment plans available through Care Credit which has been very helpful. The only real negative thing in my eyes is that I selected sedation dentistry because of my anxiety with dental appointments, but I can't seem to get gas for those appointments. I will stick with them until I find a place that will do gas though because again, they are really nice :)
I enjoy the every corner of it. Fun place to roaming around. Varieties in commodities and options to choose.
This was the second car that I have purchased at this CarMax in Plano. My sales representative, Jack, was very helpful and took care of me in a timely manner. 10 days with my new car, the engine shut down and gave me a few warning codes. I called Jack and he instructed me to bring the car back ASAP so that they could look at it. 3 days later, my car was fixed and I was able to pick it up. I was a little concerned that my "new" used car was safe to drive, according to their point inspection, but I know that coincidences happen. My only disappointment was when I picked up my 10 day old purchase from the repair facility, it wasn't washed or fueled up. It probably wasn't policy for CarMax to have to do those two items, like they did when I purchased it, but having the car for only 10 days and then already having service performed on it, I guess I was expecting "over the top" service. I received good service but better then poor service, right?
The better one than any other internet service provider. Worth paying, reasonable. Good service within the expected time.
Delicious steak tacos.
Absolutely love it! All time VISITOR! They've got my vote!

Really Simple BUT Good & "Cheap" Asian/Island (American) style food...they have a Great Location as far as Neptune Beach distance! About 2 minutes away (walking) But Parking is Limited since there is a Hotel right in front and next to this Restaurant. I've personally gone twice now with my Pregnant GF and we both have had no compliants. So based on what we ate, I'd say it's a Must-try if your anywhere near there visiting the beach. Also they are Open from the Afternoon and stay Open until 9pm. Usually by the time the Sun goes down ;) Perfect Snack, Lunchz or Dinner

Easy walking distance from the north gate of Education City Community Housing. Western-style supermarket. Full range of groceries (meats, dairy, fruit, veg, frozen foods, dry- and canned goods), household items, personal items. Some very good quality, locally sourced produce & dairy, but mostly brand-name imports (USA, Australia, India, France). Their Egyptian feta cheese is to die for. Pretty much everything you need for daily use. Accepts MasterCard. Store hours: 9 AM to 1 PM & 4.30 PM to 10.30 PM; Fridays: 4.30 PM to 10.30 PM.
ING Cafe is an awesome place for meetings ... they have a small room with FREAKY good acoustics and will open up the main room for events after-hours. Good, reasonably-priced coffee and food, plus free computer web access and wifi.

Eddie Aguinaga the salesman was really helpful. He showed me all the cool features of the car. He also let me test drive other cars. The whole process was enjoyable for me and my wife.
Very professional and comfortable atmosphere.
Had salad that I created. Was good, fresh and large. The service was OK but push the customer through more like a process to move them on than to help. We were thinking of ordering some extra's but could not get any help. Relaxed eating with an open and bright feel.
Glentanner Park was the ideal place to stay during our visit to the Mount Cook area. It was less than a half our drive to the Mount Cook Village, and so many activities are offered right at the park. We took a magical helicopter ride around Mount Cook, including landing on the snow. We stayed for two nights in a powered site, the amenities were modern and clean including a state-of-the-art barbeque area . We were a bit disappointed to find that, despite what we had read on the website, dinner options were restricted, although, the meals we had were tasty and freshly cooked (sausage and chips for me and an omelette for my husband) and the service was impeccable. Apparently the cafe has recently been taken over by a new catering firm and they are still finding their feet, The decor is a bit tired, but there are plans for improvement. During our second night, when I expressed my disappointment at not having the tasty roast lamb that had been promised on the website, out of nowhere a beautiful lamb roast including vegetables and gravy was produced in under forty minutes! We didn't mind the wait, as the view from the cafe of Mount Cook and surrounds is absolutely breathtaking. If you are planning a visit to Mount Cook (and why wouldn't you!), please visit Glentanner Park, the staff are keen to make ongoing improvements and it will go from strength to strength I am sure.

I'm a freshman there, and for the time being, it hasn't been so bad. You can retake tests, there is after-school tutoring, there is debate, sign, Stand and Deliver, and a bunch of other clubs, and the teachers are mostly nice with you. Also, we leave at 2:40 If you look like you got the flu, the nurse will send you home, so... Bad side is that it only has 2 languages, Spanish and French, unlike SPHS. The time to move between classes is 2 minutes, but it is flexible here and there. They force you to take Engineering for freshman year, but it's not so hard/bad. At least we got more AP than SPHS! :)

I have been to the Lakeland pool a number of times. Once as the parent of a guest at a birthday party. Once while hosting a birthday party for my 10-year old. A few times individually with my family of four children. Each time the children had a blast. We feel as though the value for the enjoyment is top notch. The only reason I am giving the pool a "2" rather than a "3" is due to the parking situation and signage. We had a hard time finding the parking lot the first time. The most recent time we went, we parked near one of the large ventilation tubes coming out of the ground. When we got back to our car it was covered in a rust-colored film. We washed it as soon as we got home, and it did not all come off. We're very upset by this damage to our vehicle. There should not be parking near this exhaust.

Elias did NOT close their doors until November 8th 2013. EVERY client that Elias could NOT complete a short sale for due to the Freddie Mac issues, were offered to go to a different agent with a full team of negotiators so that the Elias name could NOT hurt them.Not ONE time did I hear Will or any of his other employees tell the client sorry we can't do your short sale peace out. Yes they were hard to get ahold of sometimes but that is because they were busy on the phones processing the short sales. EVERY client was able to call the front desk and speak to a person. Don't believe everything you read.

Excellent place with awesome concept. Menu comprises a very nice selection of simple but fine food. Be there? Go there!
We decided to try this place on a whim looking for ribs. We were very happy with it-from my 80 yr old grandma to my 4 yr old! Monday night is KIDS EAT FREE w/ adult purchase that was AWESOME! The trip tip was good but nothing exciting...get the ribs!
The cashew almond chicken was delicious and the portion was generous. But I ordered on the phone and when I came in to pick up my food (11pm on a Friday night) no one greeted me at the front or asked if I needed help while I waited there for 20 mins. I had to flag down one of the passing servers to get them to show me where to pick up my food (at the bar -- how was I supposed to know that?). The experience at Cheesecake Factory was much more organized. They told me where to pick up my food (at the Bakery) and called out my order when it was ready. That being said, the food -- once I found it -- was ready when they said it would be and the price was reasonable.
Thai City food is awesome and very reasonably priced. The sticky rice is original and the Pad Thai was great. Really enjoyed the flavors. The service was very good and friendly. The portions are plentiful too. I look forward to going again.
Me gusta el servicio que ofrece esta compania, me han asesorado muy bien! Lo mejor de todo es que me trataron con mucha familiaridad, ademas tienen el servicio en espanol, recomiendo esta compania. Gracias.

Park Bar is a go-to neighborhood bar for the Union Square area. It's pretty small and intimate so it's good for after work or after dinner drinks. It's a good place if you want to actually talk to the people you're going out with (as opposed to a louder, darker downtown bar).
We always get delivery. Food is always correct and fast. The people that delivery are very nice. We order once a week.
I'm from the south (TN), and this is one of the few places I can go when I'm jones-in for my southern fix. The fried chicken is delicious!
this museum has one BIG surprise up its sleeve: larger than life bronze sculptures, including kouroi - extremely rare, bronze kouroi: even the Athens Archaeological Museum doesn't have any, and the statues are in amazing condition. there's also a slab of marble carved with various units of measure (hand, foot, cubit etc) , to scale, from both greece and other countries such as egypt - absolutely unique. this was a couple of years ago and my memory is foggy - all the more so that photos I took, without flash, all came out bad (film camera...). you'll need a lens with a big aperture, say f2.8 or bigger. a nikon 85mm f1.4 or f1.8 would be perfect, as flash is prohibited. the museum does not allow photography in a couple of galleries of small objects. the bronze statues are AMAZING. just go. the museum staff enforces rules strictly but is friendly. almost forgot: the yachting port is just next-door. go have a walk around after the museum, to unwind your legs and take in the sea breeze.

I ordered the papaya salad (4 star spicy), laap gai, pho, my little girl ordered the pad thai noodles (a bit on the sweet side), my son also ordered pho, & my husband ordered the pad phrik (3 star medium spice). Let me tell you...the food was better than my mom's home cooking!! And that says ALOT (I'm from a Laotion family). I've eaten from other Thai restaurants in the Tri-Cites...BUT none compares to this one!! You guys ROCK!!! การแสดงความขอบคุณ = Thank You

Grill's probably has the best fish around. The menu says even people who don't like fish like theirs and I believe it. They marinate it and then put a glaze on it when they grill it. It's really good, but as many people have said it's a bit pricey for what you get and the beer in the plastic cup is really unforgivable. I always take my friends from out of town because they love it and since it's a treat to them they don't worry so much about the price.
Pleased with the service and the ride to and from home in less than ideal weather. My only gripe is tires were inflated to 42 pounds front and rear, threw the TPMS for a loop. Service " A " and a complete fluid /filter change on tranny ( 2006 MB S500 ), got out WELL below MB dollarship quote.

A well kept secret in Marin County. Jason's is a concoction of American cuisine with Asian fusion highlights and an excellent wine list. It really is a place to behold. Not the most exotic environment, but the food and the service experience makes it worth your time and the tilted outside patio is just charming. Try it!
I've worked with them for years and can vouch for their quality and service.

Im here currently waiting on food with my wife have sat for 45 minutes without a refill on my drink. We drove from fayetteville to have a nice night away from there. The food is fantastic the service is complete garbage.
The food was everything I expected from the days of old, but the decor was a far cry from the original Bennigan's chain. This location is would fall more under sports bar than casual dining atmosphere. I'm not saying that it is bad, just different from what it used to be. Bethany was our server and she did a great job!
Very near. It is ok!
This is your typical Ayala mall.

Dr Greene has operated on my shoulder for a bone spur on my rotator cuff and operated on me for a torn achilles tendon. Both operations went well. I think he is a fine physician. For one, he is conservative and not someone who will rush in to operate. Additionally, he is a good diagnostician. My wife had hip problems that were misdiagnosed by a number of other doctors but Dr Greene correctly found that she was having arthritis problems.

I had a very helpful consultation with one of the doctors at the center about my back issues and found him to be very thorough and professional. He took the time to go through my MRI results and answer all my questions; and even though he's clearly told the tale of how the back and spine work thousands of time, he did not seem rushed or rote in his talk with me. I also found the staff friendly.
Yummy!

I had to say that I had a late lunch there and it just took a long time for our server to come up to us and ask us for our drinks and then for our food order. Then waiting for the food... To sum it up. It took forever. It's more of a place for just conversation that would go for hours.

I got my control arm bushings fitted here. Provided parts, they did fitting. Price was acceptable.
Holy cow! This place is absolutely fantastic. The flavor profiles are traditional, but the food is all very approachable from a western perspective. The interior is minimalistic and the service is informal but the menu is apprriately priced. Kudos.

I have known Mason for many years. His integrity and work ethic are impeccable.
My girlfriend and I recently stayed here for a weekend getaway for our 2nd anniversary. Our overall experience was 'Good' with some minor issues. We unfortunetly did not have time to enjoy the pool or rooftop bar, but the hotel did offer sunrise yoga and massages. We also did not order from the in-room dining menus. Valet/Parking; Poor; $48.00 per night is obscene, and if we had not been staying more than a quick weekend trip I would have chosen a different hotel!! Additionally, this was the worst experience of the trip. At check-out I called 15 minutes prior to have our car pulled around from the valet. When we arrived at the valet kiosk no one was there and our car was not out front. We waited 5 minutes for the valet to come back, at which time he took our keys and finally pulled around our car despite calling earlier. When I looked at my rear wheel well there was a noticable chunk of paint missing, when I pointed this out to him he insisted it had been there before. Check-In: Excellent; We checked in around 4:00 PM so there were no lines to deal with, bell hops were great, especially with a suitcase containing fragile items. Check-in took us less than 5 minutes and we were in our room. The front desk was helpful and informative. Room: Good; We requested a room with a king sized bed and got a room with a king sized bed. No complaints there. WIFI is $13 a day, they do however offer complimentary WIFI in the lobby. We did not use either so I cannot comment on speed. The issues to note were that the make-up mirror in the bath was missing a screw and felt as though it was about to fall off the wall, also the bedside wireless phone, despite indicating charging, did not work properly. Location: Excellent; Only two blocks from the US Congress Building we were able to easily walk to all of the various museums and memorials/monuments we came to see. We used taxis twice for dinners and the rates were fair not exceeding $15. Dining: Good; We ate dinner in the hotel restaurant on Friday evening around 8:00 PM. Despite there being 8 empty tables in the restuarant the maitre d informed us that no tables were available for the two of us to have light appetizers. There were two spaces at the bar being vacated so we took those. The food was excellent and cocktails delicious. Avoid the complimentary chips given to the tables/bar, they were stale and overseasoned. Check-Out: Excellent; Express check-out by calling the front desk and notifying them is available and I would recommend taking advantage of it. There was a long line in the lobby to checkout and we were able to bypass that.

Excellent restaurant. Food good, friendly staff. Shame more people don't use it.
Who are we kidding? This is a more expensive Planet Play without the video games. Same salad bar, same pasta bar, same basic pizza. The pasta bar has 6-7 sauces instead of Planet Play's 2, the pizza is marginally better, the salad bar is exactly the same. Pizza Pie Cafe has better tasting and more exotic pizzas, but doesn't have Planet Play's baked potato bar, nor their ice cream machine or chocolate chip cookies. Also drinks are not included; add the $1.79 cost for a drink to your basic $8.50 pizza buffet charge, and it costs more than Planet Play's basic $8.99 cost including drinks. I didn't have their pizza desserts, but was told they taste great, especially the apple cobbler thingey. I'd recommend this place to: People with a lot of hungry kids. Everyone fills up for about two bucks less than Chuckarama.(No drinks). I'd also recommend this place if you want to limit your spending because if you take them to Planet Play, the kids will whine six ways to Sunday until you spring for a few video game plays. Like all good Utah buffets, the soda dispenser includes Diet Dr Pepper. Ahhhhhhhh.
Mahi Mahi Salad was delicious and I love their grilled portabello mushrooms!
I eat here regularly (at least once a month) for lunch and it's always good. I'm picky when I order but they recognize me and know my order. If there aren't any vegetarian soup options available, they've always been willing to heat one up for me. Great Brueggers, my favorite bagels in the triangle.
Buffet was good. Biscuits just need to be fresh.
The best marriage and family counseling in Ogden, UT. Learning so much about each other and how we relate and communicate, gives us the tools we need to heal.
Stayed overnight on a trip down the coast. Sites are well sized although not very private. Was initially worried about fitting a very large tent on the site but needn't have worried. Great beach close by with an interesting shipwreck. Nice bike paths through the park as well.
Good food. Great place to take non-Texan people.
Classic San Francisco tourist stop. Great place to relax an have a coffee in the park.
Just hit this place up, friday night with friends. Had 2 open tables. Service was prompt, and the food was... Surprisingly great. Some of the best hamburgers I've had in a long time. Beer selection was likewise excellent. Atmosphere was different than what would be considered typical Portland, with clean interior, lots of wood, central bar. Plus the servers were *Very* cute. Recommended as moderate priced restaurant.
Great variety of bands

A little ways from town. But well worth it....ask for server Jennifer...
Good food. Packed with people on a Monday. Feels like a little understaffed where you wait for a check or a coffee refill a little too long. A good lunch for two adulta and two kids is about $45-50 plus tip.
I love this place. I've only recently gone to a plant based diet, so I enjoy eating lunch there occasionally. There's a wide selection of food on the bar and I've loved every dish. I haven't ordered from the menu, but have eaten from the bar three or four times. The store has a big selection of products for vegans, so I feel confident that I have an excellent source for the foods I need for my program. Keep up the good work!
the food was amazing! Store was okay.. not particularly good or bad and the service was very good (for a very busy time of day)

Une brasserie ou l'on mange régionale avec des plats de qualité et surtout un accueil et un service agréable.

I had an appointment back in March. The place is tidy but very fashionable, I like the black and white color scheme. The staff isn't very large so if someone is in before you, you may have to wait. If you didn't bring a book or bring anything with you to pass the time, you can always watch Netflix. The chairs are very comfy, they don't hurt my back like most chairs. Since the staff isn't very big, there's more of a hands on touch. The doctor is very knowledgeable and it shows in her technique, I rarely ever felt any pain when instruments of different shapes were in my mouth. You get a bag of dental goodies afterwards. It was nice because I had no floss at home. Overall, I had a pleasant experience.

Went here after a debacle at "Greenhouse" in NYC. When arrived a guy tried to sell up passes for $25 versus the $35 price at the door. I didn't believe the $35 door price, but I found out when past the ID check line (I don't know if any else notice but everyone at the establishment do not know prices until your in the building. I find that to be just a moral flaw to the utmost.). When in the club they had a good vibe. All sorts going on inside. A lady walking around with a snake wrapped around her. My GF loved this. People walking on stilts. Also the temperature was nice in the building. My party pretty much stayed on the middle floor. The DJ was hit and miss. I say hit and miss because he would play hot songs, but either cut the mix right when the song got good, or he would talk through the record (really annoying in my opinion). Later through the night it was a good feeling. They even had a pizza shop inside the club and my girl got the hunger so I grabbed her a slice for $4 (a large slice though) The last image of the night was not soo nice though as a young lady was ON THE FLOOR being dry humped. God knows what was on that floor. All in all good night. My lady loved the night so I loved it even more.

I ate at the one in Norman regularly when I was at OU, and this is the same joint, pretty much. The burgers are great, perfectly cooked with some great quasi-gourmet options, and their queso is fantastic. I always get the sriracha blue cheese burger. It get pretty packed so finding a table can be hard, but these are easily the best restaurant burgers I've ever had.

Best desserts in town. Always a good selection and a funky Fifties decor.
Great food, excellent service. Decor is very mediocre but it's a great place to eat regardless. Convenient location across from the Four Seasons. Lots of employees from that hotel come in there to eat, which says a lot in that the food is very good, fast service, reasonable prices. Food reminds me of a Chipotle but with a little more individualized feel.

The people who work here in the management team anyway are awesome the cleaning staff, maintenance to the manager Lisa. They make you feel welcome and if there is a problem they make sure to take care of it ASAP. I have been staying here for a while now with my family and it seems as if alot of people stay here for longer periods of time. But at any rate I had some huge issues that came up do to a neighbor and the management made sure everything was taken care of for us.
Good place to go shopping, (without the kids)
Really liked the green enchiladas here. They serve their salsa warm which is always a plus in my eyes!
They installed granite and dealt with any issues we had with our job.

The whole time Larry was in the Hospital, he was give more than quality care. His room was always clean, and the Nurses, both male and female went out of their way to make sure his stay was more than comfortable.
They are no longer in Vic, they are in Tas. Very nice over the phone though.
Exelent food. Chicken biryani is superb. Nan here is better than nan we get in any restaurant in Mumbai.
Great service! The food is good, but not over the moon. Drinks are not stingy and pretty good wine list.

Have gotten takeout from here over the past couple of years and have always been happy with the food quality, selection, and price. One time I asked the owner if he served duck, eliciting him to serve something of menu that was delightful and prompting him to have a conversation with me about the history of China over the past century. Totally unexpected, and awesome! Friends and I ate in the dining room for the first time this week and it was well worth it. Family meals and the " Imperial meal" were abundant, tasty, and a great value.

This is the only place I will eat fast food. I am a big fan of Chipotle, but I also have to say that compared to other locations, and compared to when it opened, Roanoke skimps on the portion sizes. It used to happen infrequently, but lately portion sizes have declined at this location. I get the same thing everywhere I go: a bowl with only double meat, salsa, guacamole, and lettuce. That's it. If I'm paying $1.80 for guac, don't scrape most of it off of the spoon. If I ask for double meat, and you are charging me for it, don't make each portion smaller so I end up with 1.5x meat. I'm saving the place money on toppings as it is.
The reviews looked good, so we decided to try them out. While waiting for our food, I noticed a sign that said they were voted best fish and chips, clam chowder, and oysters on the peninsula in 2011. After trying their fish and chips and clam chowder, I would have to agree that they are very very good! I will be back for more...
Ice-Cream. Lovely flavours. A step above your usual vanilla/strawberry/honeycomb joint.

For $45 a night this hotel met all our needs. We are traveling up the Western States on the cheap--this Inn was a great find. Clean rooms, microwave & Fridge, truck parking & free Wifi. A great working air conditioner topped it off. Perfect spot to rest up for another day of driving. Quiet area with about 5 restaurants within a block. A few things to consider....if you are picky---rooms are small and cozy, towels are thin and small. A great value! Loved the guy at the front desk---they don't get much real-er, lol! Be sure and pick up the free guide for Hotel discounts at a Denney's restaurant--there are some worthwhile gems in it.
Customer service is always great/friendly, food's great. Never had any issues.
Excellent....:)
I have gone to this theater multiple times in my life, with friends and dates and such. For service I find that the staff are moderately polite, though compared to people in the area very polite, and they always seem to be helpful. The concessions are expensive, I'll give it that. The theater is oldish but it's not falling apart, the facilities are up to date so I don't ever see its age as a problem. Like all theaters, the popular movies are shown on large screens and the movies that have been out for a while are in the smaller screening rooms, not all the screens are big, but most aren't small. Overall, I like the theater and continue to go there often due to convenience and preference.
Have been eating here at least twice weekly for about 3 yrs. They're open from around 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. for breakfast and lunch. Food is great...just like Mom used to make! They have meat dishes, full range of vegetables, salads and great sandwiches. Their specials are very reasonable, from $5 to $8 for lunch. Great coffee, good pies, if all you want is a coffee break. Very friendly owner-couple are always there to cheer you up and make sure the servers are taking care of you. Atmosphere is great...walls full of collectibles from the 40's to 60's. Easy to find, easy to park, no long waits on food. You can't beet it on quality food on a budget!
For the area that its in very good service but is very small and just enough space to have a (1) friend with you no more then that cause then your friend might have to eat out side

I can only comment on experience - Had a bladder infection which would typically take 3-5 days on drugs to clear up. A family member called Marcos on my behalf and the next day I had no symptoms at all. I'm not saying it's a substitute for visiting a Dr. but it sure seemed to work for me.
Best Walmart in Phoenix!
Was good hit the spit
I completely disagree with the other person who reviewed. I thought the customer service was excellent. The person working was very polite and friendly with me, and I found my overall experience there to be very good. Having worked in retail, I can only suggest that the other reviewer may not have been very friendly him/herself and may have been annoying the worker with their attitude (because yes, employees have feelings and bad days too). I wish the store was a bit bigger and had more product, but it's a reasonable size considering that comics don't offer a lot of profit.
Worlds Series game night, the restaurant was packed with excited fans. I told server Anthony that my friend and I wanted to watch the game (2-3hrs) and he commented, "OK just take care of me". This was understood but he could have avoided saying it. I decided to leave after being jserved during the bottom of the first inning after dinner because I was not prepared to buy drinks for the next few hours to make good on the request to "take vv of him". Once finished, the check was delivered, and there was an extra entree charge of the chicken wing special. Because It was the special for the evening the entree fee could have been missed had I not paid attention to the check. The extra charge $14.00! When I confronted Anthony he behaved as if he knew about the error. I felt Anthony was trying to take advantage of the spirit of the evening. He may have made extra gratuity by voiding off the entree after we left the establishment adding the 14.00 as the tip. I'm commenting because, I believe this is a very bad(fraudulent) practice and patrons should be aware of this alleged deceptive behavior. Keep your eyes on your checks at this place. Also the food was hot and the table was tacky or sticky as if full of hardened old grease. The floors are slippery. Please clean up your place!

Nice place with a Excellent service
We had a great time Saturday night with another couple who suggested the place. Great food, great service, good time. We may go back again this weekend with my cousins.
We decided to move our closing to a few days earlier, and they were able to accommodate us last-minute. Because they were so busy, we had to wait ~20 minutes for our appointment. They did a good job of explaining all of the many documents we had to sign. They had forgot to have us sign one of the documents, so they emailed that document to use, we signed it, scanned it, and emailed it back to them; that was a bit inconvenient. That same day we were able to get our keys, and they gave us a hard copy of everything we had signed and our HOA documents. They had a small children's room for our 4-year-old to play in while we waited to begin, so that made it bearable. They also had many snacks/treats/beverages that we could help ourselves to while we waited (the 4-year-old also enjoyed that). This is the only house I've bought, but I thought it was relatively painless.

I love this place. I am from NY and it is obviously not quite as good as some of the places I ate while in NY, and sometimes the employees don't know how to make it the right way but they r still improving. Ever since the expansion they have gotten much better. This is probably my favorite place to eat around here. :) very good

The staff is friendly, the center is clean, and the price is reasonable. The first time I called to schedule an appointment they told me what to expect and offered me a discount on my first visit. My technician, Brittany, was great. She made me feel comfortable, wore gloves, and did her best to distract me from the pain. I have gone back and will continue to go to European Wax Center because they are professional and the price is great!
I enjoy the food here always. I enjoy the pizza but the Calzones are my favorite. Good sized portions so you will leave full.

Even though this is supposed to be the same as the original Fresh Air BBQ in Jackson, GA, it is by far not even close. There is a major difference in the taste of the sauce and even more of a difference in the taste of the stew and cole slaw. It's ok if you just want bbq, but if you want the absolute BEST bbq from Fresh Air, drive the extra 45 minutes to go to the original in Jackson, it's much better!

To be honest, when I was headed for this store I thought it was going to be smelly and have a perverted dude staring us down the whole time. I was wrong. It is built like a department store. It's spacious, and clean. Plus, they have all sorts of goodies for men and women. If I need to get anything for me or the woman I am with I will go their again.

Great food for a small town
Every single time I dine here, I must have the Kale Salad. It is, by far, the best salad on the menu. The Umami Burger is also really good.
When I worked near this restaurant, I would eat here quite frequently. It was a great place to go for lunch. The food was excellent and of good value. The place looks run down and they usually only have one or two wait staff.
a lot of shirt with minimal style at little cost.
If you sit at the bar, ask for Tom. He's a great sushi chef. The Round Rock roll is really good, and the happy hour sushi is the same as normal hours.
I have to agree with CJFlaum, the other two reviewers did not eat at Sakura. The restaurant's been around for 27 years and I've never heard anything but high praise, so I finally went in yesterday. We were given the wrong menus, but that's not that big a deal. After getting the right menus and ordering, we had the best meal ever. Sushi was fresh. Tempura was light and crispy. The seaweed salad is exquisite. Beer prices, especially for the Japanese beers, are high, but everything else is reasonable given the serving you receive.
Very good for Led Zeppelin, Jimi Hendrix, Miles Davis and the rest with tap beer and starters. Watching Cricket and Football matches with all this is quite fun here.
This place has a great environment! Very lively, the service is what can be expected from a restaurant that is as busy as this and the food is wonderful!
Service was super fast today. Had the pizza and was fantastic . Cadian cream ale is super, and for those who are non alcoholics, the root beer is to die for. Beats A&W hands down.
My boyfriend and I stayed here for a couple weeks for a friends wedding. Close to Yokohama and lots of interesting shops. Sure the rooms are small, but for the $40 we spent it was totally worth it, and cozy! There was a TV to watch the local channels, air conditioning and a mini fridge in the room. It was nice to have the kitchen when we wanted to make small meals (but to be honest, we mostly ate out or went to the Family Mart up the street for snacks) My tips: don't use the dryer. I spent 700+ yen to realize why everyone just hangs up their laundry on the top floor by the garden. And ask for European pillows. The pillows that come in the room are the small bean types for people that sleep on their backs which I'm not used to. Trying to use the shower wasn't too bad, just write your room number on the whiteboard to claim the next spot if it's busy. But we only had to do that once. Remember to pack light! As there isn't a lot of space in your room. Oh, there's also a small supermarket just past the train station, it's easy to miss, but it was nice to know it was there. Overall, it was a excellent experience. For westerners like us, it was a real culture shock. But I loved it and would stay here again.
One of the better Pocono mountains. Recently renovated! Free ski and snowboard check, air bag cool terrain runs....I like this place
Good food, Pricey, but I mean i like it.
Very tasty enchiladas and beans. Very surprised that it was so good. Much better than Taco Bell. Yum.
Bathrooms are so clean you could eat off of the floor or the porcelain surfaces. Interior is also always clean, not just picked up or de-cluttered but "just been mopped/scrubbed/washed down clean". The modern technology used for menu boards, as well as the flat screens featuring current events and news, along with the totally free high speed wifi make this our favorite one to go to when we're in town. The food has always been fast, fresh, and made rite to order. And the menu prices are significantly lower than the stores in our local area. I'd give 5 stars, however, as it is with all things in life, there's always room for improvement.
Waiter was slow during lunch but wasn't horrible, still enjoyed it
I am from Peoria ,Illinois love comn here to shop at Wal-Mart love.
It is very costly , rates are like big city
This is a really great restaurant. It has wonderful food and friendly people. Try the chicken mahkni.
We have been staying here every May and October for over 20 years and would never go elsewhere. Accommodations could not be better. It is quiet, private, immaculately clean, owner friendly and a 10 minute walk to our seats at the track. There is on site management at all times. They will park you and set you up if necessary. Sites are very spacious and most are drive through. If it rains no one is sitting in water or mud. Security is top notch. The owner, Phillip, stops by daily just to see if we need anything. Race day is even peaceful. I can't see where it could get any better than this.
Your standard Indian restaurant but with a twist: they do some Goan dishes too if you want something different. So we tried some of those and they were great. I had Galina Cofreal, grilled chicken breast cooked in Goan spices, and it was two whole breasts. That's a lot of chicken. But the side dishes were the best bit. The Paneer Masalader was very good and the Aloo Anar Kali (stuffed potato, raisin, mash potato & green peas simmered in tomato gravy) was, well just weird ... but very fine. Recommended.

If I had read the reviews below before eating here, I never would have tried it. I'm glad I did! They have the best, most affordable lunch specials. My favorite thing to order is the terriyaki shrimp with fried rice, it has to be the best I've ever had, cooked to a perfect slightly-crunchiness with great sauce. The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is the lady that's a waitress there is always a little moody, so the service leaves something to be desired...and having been a waitress before myself, I am usually not that picky or negative about that sort of thing. So, if you can prepare yourself with the possibility of dealing with a little attitude & go just for the food, you'll enjoy eating here. :)
The best place ever... Most memorable days are spent here...

The service at the Avon store was outstanding. Every employee we encountered was very helpful and polite, esp. our salesperson. I bought a large bookcase and the cost was $399. When it arrived, there were some nicks, some uneven stain, a couple of things coming apart. I phoned customer service and they sent a technician out the same day. He fixed everything that was wrong, and now the case looks great. I am very pleased with the service I received and highly recommend Jordan's Furniture.
This was our first time ordering there & we loved it!! Even the kids did!! Will definitely order here again!
Pork knuckles nya is very very good. Should go there and try.
Consistently HOT, FRESH, FAST, AFFORDABLE, and YUMMY!
I bought my Honda from Brandfon on a very busy Saturday. Despite this, Billy G. was helpful and positive, and overall the experience was a good one.
95% of my theater going experiences were from here. I remember watching the Lion King and Star Wars Episode 1 most before. Lord of the Rings Trilogy was my inspiration into films and alongside it I went to the theater more frequently. The Local Advertisements - I remembered for so many years they played the "Gladiator" soundtrack in the theater. With nothing but black screen I would slip into my wildest imaginations and had the most epic orchestrations to back it up before I became a film soundtrack enthusiast.But that's now gone and we get ads these days from local businesses. At first they were terrible for stealing my attention and evaporating all the anticipation of waiting in a quite theater(aided with soundtrack) but over time the ads got much better and I have accepted that they'll likely never return to that mysticism treatment nowadays in this Information Age. Prices - They swing at times depending on the season. Right now they are a bit pricy I must admit. Best bargain is the combo with a free refill, but at the expense of having to walk out of the movie for 1-2 minutes. Digital Projectors - Since the upgrade I have no major gripes so far. The image is cleaner and hasn't lost it's cinematic feel.
Popped in for a Friday lunch with friends and was really impressed by the freshness of the salads and the bold flavours. Despite being super busy, our food arrived quickly. The fresh spring rolls were light and full of flavour, they just need a little more of their hero ingredient, the duck. The standout dish was the poached chicken salad in a coconut dressing - crisp salad, not swamped by dressing. The green papaya salad was crunchy, sour and delicious. If you need to wait for a table, they turn over quickly. They looked to be doing a brisk trade in takeaway lunches too.

The Steelman family would like to say big thanks to cleaning services atl. We moved ffrom Marietta to Atlanta and needed to clean the serious mess left by the prev renters.

This hotel was recently purchased and is under new ownership. The lobby has been remodeled and is really nice. (I hear the previous owners had a fire.) The rooms are clean, the sheets are new, towels are fluffy (best I've had at a hotel) and the shower had lots of pressure. We had an opportunity to speak with the owner (between phone calls with various contractors) and he shared his plans for total remodel. If you need a place to stay in Needles, this is your best bet.

I like the huge chair out front.
The food was more disappointing than not! We started with a great appetizer boat, and looked forward to the other choices. It would seem that miso soup and white chocolate bread pudding could not fail, but they did, miserably. The "hot and sour Thai miso soup was just plain sour. The bread pudding had no taste at all -- just medium dry little cubes with no sauce. Luckily the good vanilla ice cream on the plate kept it from being a complete disaster. Of course the restaurant is warm and beautiful and the service was mostly excellent, with just a lapse toward the end when we were ignored after having been served the dessert. We probably would have been very happy had we made more good choices. The appetizer led us to expect great things of the kitchen, and I'm sure there were such things on the menu. One of our part got a salad that she pronounced "very good." But it's too bad when such simple things as miso soup, Thai soup (both usually wonderful wherever you find them) can be ruined by combining them, and bread pudding is a failure. It's very easy to make really great bread pudding! So, if you go, try to get menu recommendations ahead of time, or hope you make the right choices.
Blue Bee's website was easy to use, their customer service was excellent, and the print quality was great. My magnets looked exactly like the file I sent, and I was very happy over all.

The place doesn't look like much, but the service and food more than make up for it. I don't think it is the best pho in the city, but the accouterments are super fresh and the food is extremely consistent. The prices are reasonable, and the staff is attentive and friendly. A great little hole in the wall place for good food at a reasonable rate.

I went to Antelope Canyon in 1991 before it became a Navaho main tourist attraction. I was in Page and someone told us to go see it we were directed in, it was amazingly beautiful and I have my own photographs of it. More recently we wanted to go but it was $15 p.p. to go in and we didnt want to pay. So I have my happy memories and photographs. It felt very spiritual.
Very helpful. Went above and beyond on my last tune.

Our second visit to Comedy Carnival at the Grand in Clapham (nicely opposite Clapham Junction Station). My wife and I love the Grand as a building, great architecture and have fond memries of seeing the late Jeff Healey in concert there around 19 years ago. What a good deal, the ticket price (some (£17.00) gives you a format that includes 3 top comedians, plus comic compere. Seating is all relatively close to the stage, so even though the venue is spacious you get the required air of intimacy that all good comedy venues thrive on. It gets better, the staff are all nice and the drinks are cheap in terms of standard London prices. The wines are decent, it just goes on........ Things to moan about. well you buy 'Reserved seats' on line and then you cant reserve your seats, someone does it for you. Sure enough we were front row and just off centre, right in the 'Line of fire'. In our 50's my wife and I were the oldest people in the venue. I can't help that, I grew up in comedy clubs just as the wave of talent that brought us Jo Brand, Paul Merson, Jack Dee et al was breaking and I love comedy as an art form. Still we were given a bit of stick for being oldies. That was no problem, but I think reserved seating should let you choose roughly where you want to be. Still it was a great night with the talent on show really up to spec. After enduring 1.5 hours of suffering with the ticket master website and customer service I now hopefully have tickets for the 16th March, my sons 18th Birthday night out. He's a comedy addict, where else will I take him? Keep up the good work Gary
This is a very great place to grab a quick breakfast burrito. They have the best options in Pueblo. Their lunch is great, too. But they close @ 2:00pm so it limits you to a time range you might not be able to make. All in all it's a great place and worth the money.
Good place to stop by if you are around in the area, not somewhere to drive to however. Food is tasty, and service is good.
The carnitas are well prepared and the salsa are very flavorful. Chicharrones have a lot of lard. I like them like that from time to time, but many people don't like that at all. Be prepared for a line if you go during lunch, but it usually moves pretty quickly.

They're fast, easy and clean. Also love their free vacuum stations and free air for tires. What more can you ask for?

I'll make this short and sweet. If you want a burger, go to Burger King, Wendy's, or Mickey D's. If you want a religious experience on a bun, go here. These guys make a burger I'd put against just about anyone. I would put them against Five Guys or In n Out any day of the week. If you know a thing or two about a burger, then you know just how heavy what I said is. These guys deliver. Plain and simple. Now let's all bow our heads.

Recently I bought a car at Serra kia and my sales person was Jimmy Dean and he was very nice and helpful to get me in a car i liked, any problems I had were all worked out and they work hard to keep the customer happy. All staff I came in contact with were very nice and everything was very clean. The cars are reasonably priced and I recommend Serra Kia if you are looking for a new or used car!

Always helpful and doesn't mind when my kids play with the squeaky toys. He will even deliver to your door if you ask him nicely. So please could you drop off the kitty litter and bunny food Friday 9th November any time coz I think you may have forgotten slightly today - Thursday 8th November. Thanks Paula
First time in Vegas. Great view from room, clean. Nice location. Easy access to LV strip. The only thing I didn't like is the parking which I had to park way up to another hotel's terrace and walk like 20 min to get to my room.
C'est thaïlandais, vraiment, et très fin. Pak, le patron est un homme de bien. Et sa femme fait la cuisine comme pour lui, mais pour vous. Et c'est bon et féérique. Merci !
They had the stuff for my pet I needed. Customer service was good but not great.
很慢啊～
Although the process took much longer than expected, in all I have been happy to date with the service received.

Went to window didn't find 3rd burger in bag they said they didn't charge for 3rd burger asked for bag back to check. after we paid for 3rd burger n got our bag back when we got home still no 3rd burger what the hell...
Great place and wonderful salon. Everyone here was very friendly and fantastic. They were totally interested in what I wanted and how I looked. My experience was very positive. Definitely will be returning.
Good food great atmosphere
Kington is a delight. Climbing the hill to England's highest course, enshrouded in mists in early April I wondered what I had let myself in for- a feeling that only increased, despite a friendly welcome at the pro shop, as my crisp tee shot on the first caught the brow of a steep hill and rolled back at least 60 yards. I had come for the fantastic views and all I could see was mist and mizzling rain. Battling on, the golfing gods must have smiled on this lone player who had travelled miles to play here, for trudging up the eighth hole, Bradnor Rise, the clouds lifted and shafts of sunlight began to break through. By the time I putted out for my par on Bryn Awelon, the short ninth, the views across Hergest Ridge were sensational. Despite greens that were disappointingly sluggish (otherwise this would be a nailed on five stars) the back nine were a joy. At 14, appropriately named Whole View, I could see the Black Mountains, the Brecon Beacons and the Malvern Hills. It is hard not to enjoy a round in a place like this when the sun shines. And shine it did right up until the last hole, an exhilarating 283 yard par four down hill ending up below the clubhouse windows. And reader, I drove it, narrowly missing an eagle two before tapping in for a birdie and off for a pint of excellent cider in one of the most friendly and welcoming club houses. I had had a wonderful time on a first rate course. I cannot wait to play it again, and only hope the sun will shine on me once more like it did on this early April morning.
Best stake in Yuma!
Absolutely delicious great wonderful will return
Одно из немногих мест в Ташкенте, где демократичный интерьер и отсутствие официантов абсолютно не мешают провести время ВКУСНО! Но вот столы лучше не объединять, особенно, если компания женская (уж больно шумно становится...:) ) .

This theater is so nice, the seats are plush, the screen and sound are excellent, but the service is the worst Ive ever had. And its been that way 3 times in a row. I recently went to see Prometheus, got to the theater an hour early and was seated about 30 minutes later, pressed the blue button for service and didn't have anyone come to help me for about 20 minutes. I wrote what I wanted on the ticket and gave to to a random server who came up to us and i guess noticed we hadnt been helped. This is all after the people next to us had already gotten their food! The movie started and 30 mins into it, still hadnt even gotten my beer! Pressed the button again, but finally had to wave someone down and they seemed to never even realize I had ordered, almost like they completely lost my ticket. Finally got my drink and waited for my food, 30 minutes later had to wave another person down and again, had no idea what I ordered and had to re-order through person, which was very disturbing while watching a movie. FINALLY got my food over half way through the movie. By then I had atleast 4 different people "helping" me, wasnt sure who my server was. I was very very dissatisfied. This was the worst of my experience here at the theater, but the previous 2 times were quite similar. Very slow, disorganized service. The servers dont come back to check on you, to refill waters or other drinks unless you press the button, which honestly is a worthless effort anyways. Flix needs a different waiting system, It almost ruined my movie, and makes me not want to come ever again. I was so angry to have to constantly talk to 4 different waiters throughout my movie just to get a damn beer and a pizza. If they had a better system, maybe like Alamo's, I would come here all the time. Its close to my apartment and everything else is really nice, the food is great, but the service is ridiculous. I wonder if those blue buttons even work to alert the servers or they're just there to hope that a server passing through your section will notice a blue light and hopefully give you some service. Honestly I wouldnt come hungry to this place, eat before or after, and just enjoy the nice theater. Dont even bother with getting anything once seated, just grab a beer in the lobby beforehand. In my experience, it would be the best bet. Its a shame, because this theater could be so great, but now id rather spend my money at Alamo Drafthouse where ive ALWAYS had great service!
Great golf course. Cheap, fun, and the people are great. Its not to hard for the learning golfer, bit its also good for the more experienced ones as well. It got a 2 because its still an inner city golf course, so you sacrifice a lot of beauty and solitude you would get at say, Bountiful Ridge.

Should try mujadhra, crushed lentil soup.
This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town. The lunch deals are especially good. Pad Thai is probably my favorite.
Really nice people that work here! The food was great as well!
pleasanton taxi cab is truly the best cab service in pleasanton california , they always show up on time #pleasantontaxi
I have been there twice. Once with my family and enjoyed our meal and the second time I was alone and the food and service were excellent.
Have had two networking meetings here, but both times the service and staff have been great.
When in the mood for great improv, I head down to Comedy Sportz. In the 40+ times I've been there it never fails to impress to me. It's much like the TV show Who's Line, but completely different and better. I have brought half a dozen new people to this place over the years and each of them raved at the amazing time they had. Friday evenings they have special 18+ (recommended) shows so be warned about this up front, all other shows are family and kid friendly. Regardless of the show you see, it'll be amazing. Order tickets a day ahead of time at least, they sell out many shows.
We recently went to Haridwar, Rishikesh and Mussoorie, got rooms booked at Haridwar for a night and Mussoorie for 2 nights. Excellent stay making the most memorable holiday time had in the recent years. My entire family enjoyed the stay. Thanks True Seasons. Special thanks to Shivanna.
Good fresh seafood, cleaned to your specifications. Good fresh oysters. friendly and helpful. I buy to travel often and Fisherman''s Dock packs product in my cooler for the trip. Always gets there fresh and cold.
The music is really nice. The fried Kalahari is delicious, but the bloody Mary is a little thin, and the pulled pork Benedict just lacked some consistency. Somehow it ended up being heavy, what is the opposite of a good Benedict.

The food is good, American style Mexican at reasonable prices. I prefer to order ceviche, which isn't on the menu, but it is made fresh, takes about twenty minutes to prepare but is worth the wait. Their happy hour specials are cheap! The staff is great from the owner on down. My favorite Mexican restaurant in Woodinville.
After having a great hair color at Rodolfo Valentin Salon last week I went down stairs to have lunch at Nello. I always wanted to have time to spend there because when I go to the salon I see beautiful people having lunch there but most of them are acting like being in a showcase so I also wanted to share the stage. I had a good time while there chatting with the waiters, also the owner Nello stop by to say hello. The food is good Italian food, nothing superb but no bad at all. Decor is based in fresh flowers which make the place look very nice and the service is very friendly. Prices are high but worth the tab to watch beautiful people and show my beautiful hair around.
Got there at noon and the catfish on the buffet was already gone. Lame! Ordered the philly, was delicious. Clean and good service.
It's a sacred place for shia muslim's in Bangladesh.
A little pricey, but awesome sandwich!!!!
Food is good, place is too shabby though, you might not like the look and feel
Good friendly guys here
Die Bleiberger Fabrik bietet ein gutes Programm. Konkret haben wir einen sehr schönen Kindergeburtstag dort gefeiert, der uns sehr gut in Erinnerung bleiben wird. Ein Blick ins Programm lohnt sich.
Food was really good but the service could have been better. There weren't to many people when i came in with my family, it took almost 15 min till someone came to get our order.
The food here is solid for a sports bar. Everything is good. They have great outdoor seating and plenty of televisions for the games.
Great service, very friendly, and the pharmacy is amazingly fast with prescriptions!

Walked in with chest pain/heart problems on what looked like a pretty busy week night. I was in an ER room within 10 minutes surrounded by doctors and being treated.
Sehr schöne Therme, besonders die Karibik-Lagune .....
We love this place, a little too much! Simple & good! Always a great selection, but you have to get their early or settle for the leftovers (which are still great).
En casa descansando.
Only been here a few times, but the food is delic and the staff are friendly!
This place is amazing - it's got everything! Great views, OK facilities, lots of room and a compulsory 11-mile single-track hair-raising mountain drive to get there. The campsite itself is great, and the drive to get to it weeds out the cowards. Nice.
توی کرمان تکه ولی در کل سرویساشم خوبه
Creative well prepared food. NB: they are not afraid of spice. Service is ok & needs improvement to bring it to the food's standard. In warm weather, opt for the fabulous patio.
Always enjoy...
Don't let these people's bad experiences ruin an oppurtunity to live in a decent area with comparably cheap rent. The location is prime. You are never further than 10-15 minutes from anything in Columbia with the close highway exits. The neighborhood is not dirty. There are no "hoodlums" hanging out at all times of the night. I heard of some breakins around the complex but the tenents in my building and I have never had any issues. There are multiple security guards at the facility gate and from what I can see, most everyone is either military or working individuals who just want to come home to peace and not cause any for anyone else. Maintenance could be better but if you go to the front office and force their hand, so to speak, you'll get your problem worked out promptly. The sad thing about reviews is only people who have a bad experience usually writes them. If everything is fine, then people don't. Well I'm someone who thinks everything is fine and you have nothing to fear living in Greenbrier. ***Note**** Live on the top floor if you can. No one living above you and better ceilings.

Parking is a nightmare! No assigned spaces and very little control over unauthorized guest who park in the garage. The garbage room fills up with trash bags at least once weekly. The trash chute gets so filled residents just drop their trash bags in the room on the floor. Keith the main maintenance person is excellent. Responsive to residents needs 24hr/weekly. The office staff is extremely professional and again, Neil, Rachel and company respond immediately to resident concerns. It is a luxury apartment complex and you do feel as though you live in a special place. The horticulture is amazing. Well kept and watered. The Mansion itself is for rent to host parties..a great option!

La première fois nous avons apprécié le resto, le bar, la disco, l'ambiance surper clean. La deuxième nous avons apprécié la balnéo... Jusque là nous étions restés sages! Mais comment résister aux soirées du mardi ou du vendredi et ne pas profiter des alcôves si accueillantes?

Great wings with tons of vegetables. Fries are excellent for about 5 minutes and then get soggy with grease, some people like that though. The wings more than make up for it at a decent price. I frequent this restaurant often.

Tasty firestorm! Got the food with spice level hot and it was great. The prices seem high but the portions are quite big so it is worth the price. Two people could easily share a dish.
It is a nice park that is close to my home. I took my boys there to teach them a little fishing. We didn't catch anything, but still we had fun walking around and just enjoying the sites and saying hello to everyone.
Awesome coffee, very friendly staff, very decent snacks. The white chocolate caramel iced latte is a must-try. Also, they actually serve beef lasagne with a pretty authentic bologna style sauce! I am sick and tired of 99% of the places that offer lasagne in Islamabad serving the chicken variant only. Everything is prices quite fairly too. And there's a charging-station-cum-work-desk where any patron can sit and work. I sit here for hours at times, working and enjoying my coffee and snacks.

Overall experience was good. The wait staff is very helpful. Food was OK but not exceptional for the prices they charge. Surf and Turf is 3 pieces of shrimp or scallops and an 8oz filet mignon, vegis and potatoes for $34. Make sure you ask for a first cut, non-rolled up scraps of filet mignon. They use the skinny end of the filet mignon to pass off a filet mignon. Over cooked and dry. Definitely did not melt in my mouth.
Really enjoyed my time at Lakeside today. It was one of several attempts to find a decent barbershop that does straight blade shaves. Mike took very good care of me and had a great sense of humor. I can't vouch for the others, but everyone there seemed more than capable. I got a cut and a shave, and the price was very reasonable. I will be going back when I'm in this area if for nothing else the shave. The reason that I did not give a perfect score is that even though the shop is clean and setup nicely, it doesn't have a rustic, manly feel that a perfect shop has, in my opinion. Secondly, my skin is very sensitive, and, this was not the very best shave I've ever had. Maybe I have impossibly high standards. That said, I will return to Mike. He did a fantastic job, and I really appreciate his service.

Been there long ago, and the food and atmosphere was magical. We were fortunate enough to spend the night in the two cute rooms above the restaurant and then went for a hike the next day. The WWII history and story of the fabulous lady proprietor made the weekend even more special. Highly recommend.

Nice place, seemed clean and was pretty quiet. Small indoor pool but it looked inviting and well-maintained. My only complaint is it is 2 levels and there's no elevator (that we could find). We were on the second floor and lugged all our stuff up the stairs ourselves, and then back down again for check-out.
Good enough
I really enjoyed Ray's dress shop in Warwick. I was able to deal directly with Ray, who helped me find the perfect dress for my wedding anniversary. The dress was beautiful and my husband would agree that I looked amazing in it. Thanks Ray and your team!
This gun shop is a great addition to what is otherwise a relatively small town in a fairly rural area. They have reasonable prices on firearms, reasonable ammunition prices (given the context of being this far from Kansas City) and a solid gunsmith who delivers when promised and usually at a better value than expected. Not sure what the other reviewer was referencing, but I am a regular customer, have bought a gun here and had a lot of gunsmith work done here. In my experience, this is not a cliquish place. Sometimes when you walk in the door, there are groups of guys shooting the breeze when the shop is empty, but that is just the kind of small-town service environment you can expect here.

As a potter, weaver, and painter, I make regular stops at the Broadway store for stimulation and educational inspiration. Great staff, and amazing selection, and great deals are to be had.
One of the better soft play areas we have been to. Its has a under 2s area, which is good as our 17 month, didn't get knocked about by older kids. The food there was standard fair for these kind of places. Reasonably priced admission and food.
Awesome
Aisling and Gemma are great to work with, really know there stuff. Professional, attention to detail and quick turnaround. Recommended.
sometimes can be slow but it is due to how busy this place is all the time.. Added so many flat screen now..

We just completed our second refinance with Quicken -- cutting our rate another half percent and reducing the length of our loan, with our monthly payment the same despite a huge tax increase that we are experiencing. Everyone we worked with at Quicken was friendly, clear and very helpful. Our loan process took about a month from initial contact to the loan being closed. The online application process worked very smoothly and it was easy to scan and upload PDFs of required documents. The website is very clear as to next steps and that helped to make the process go more smoothly. Our closing took place at our kitchen table after work and was very quick and relatively painless. I don't hesitate to recommend Quicken for those looking for a mortgage or for refinancing. Dave
Very nice people. Clean place, decent prices.

Well, our company went online about a year and a half ago and we quickly realized that in order to be attract customers we had to get our site optimized. We did a little research and eventually decided that ebrandz had the best rates for the most keywords. Basically if I had to sum it up, ebrandz drives guests to our site. Their work helps put us on the "map" so to speak and through their services we were able to quickly climb the google ladder and start appearing under search queries - so ultimately we get the greatest benefit there is in business - Sales and Profits.
Needles are not my favorite thing, however, this trip and many others were very near to painless! The staff was wonderful. It would be good to have the hours of operation posted on the website or available on a recorded phone message.
The pizza and spuds were great. Waiter was courteous, yet, he forgot to order our spuds, but, when he realized he comp'd them. Had a nice dinner and atmosphere was just as nice! Would recommend to anyone!!
I went early in the am.... I found it to be very good, a bit costly. Overall, I would go back just for the latte' it was soo good..... I do not remember the floor being dirty. They are very busy, so they may need to hire someone for a few hours a day just to keep up with the demand of cleanliness.... :) I definitely would recommend this place!!!!

We found Pawnee to be a busy place even at 12am when we pulled in. We had no problem finding a site in the primitive area despite the number of cars we saw. Nice level sites, newer pit toilets.
Great beer garden. Very tasty Food. Prices are fair. Waitress could be nicer but food and drinks come quick.
I loved my experience with Round Rock Toyota - this is my 2nd purchase with them - previously, I had purchased a previously owned 2000 Sienna - and now, in May, I purchased a new 2012 4 Runner!

I love all the reviews complaining about out of order or outdated games. A) Have you been to an arcade lately? Most of the arcade games at Dave and Busters are the newest games on the market. I'm not sure what world you live in, but go ahead and look them up on any arcade machine shop (such as CoinOpExpress, etc.). You look dumb complaining about that. B) Yes, many games were made from mobile games. Welcome to 2014 where mobile games are actually pretty popular. Hell, the Doodle Jump game is actually a LOT of fun. Cut the Rope gives more tickets for little effort than many of the other games. C) Out of order? Yes. Welcome to an ARCADE where literally hundreds of people play the games each day. I'm not sure what electronics you've purchased lately, but that much use is bound to cause games to go out of order. Complaining that a game owes you tickets? Wow. You must not have been to an arcade lately. Every time I've been (at least 1-2 times per month since they opened), there has been maybe 2-3 games out of about 50-60 that were out of order. D) The food. You go to a place that explicitly shows they serve bar food, then complain that it's bar food. I have never had an issue with food being cold when it shouldn't, and it's actually been pretty decent considering it's an arcade + bar + restaurant. They have a pretty large selection, and I have yet to get a meal that I don't like there. Then again, I'm not looking for a 5-star filet mignon at a bar. I'm looking for things that are fried and incredibly unhealthy for me, and D&B serves it up. E) Go on Wednesday. Seriously. All games are half price, which puts them at a pretty decent value for the amount of time you'll get to play. Going any other day is just silly. I will agree that the service is lacking a bit, but that's why I dock one star rather than give the entire place the lowest rating simply because I've had 1-2 experiences trying to walk up to the bar to get a drink, and having to wait 5 minutes or so. I realize this is in Cary, and many of you are rich snobs from New York, but it's kind of pathetic seeing people give a place the lowest rating simply because their food was a bit cold or a game they wanted to play was out of order. Get real.

La nourriture est bonne, le service aux tables aussi, mais on est trop bousculé. J'imagine qu'ils veulent remplir la place le plus possible. Un samedi soir d'octobre, on arrive à 8h00 pm après avoir réservé dans la journée, et à 9h00 on nous apportait notre facture. Pour la relaxation, on repassera!
So glad we found a piece of SA!
Mój dziadek wychował się tutaj, ale założę się, że nie było Maccas wtedy!
We really enjoyed the atmosphere and ambiance of the place despite the fact that it was quite noisy. We did not care for the seating-it's very tight and we were seated at a long table with several other people. But we enjoyed our food nonetheless: very tasty burger (we tried the #4 with green chili and fried egg), and delicious mac & chz with a nice cheddar bite. The fries shoulda-woulda been good, but they were too salty. Fun little place in a fun neighborhood.

This place is awesome . . . lots of different shoes for all types of athletes and even mathletes as well. I bought a pair of shoes for my nephew here and the staff was very helpful in showing me how to design a unique pair with Nike id technology. I was a little sad that this used to be a Barnes and Noble where people could come and read on a Sunday morning, but Nike did a good job of using the same massive space and hiring good staff.

The Burger Shake, a roadside burger joint...............the marvel of burger engineering.

Bad part they don't deliver..but worth waiting for an hour to get it. Satisfying..............

pokud jste ještě nenašli v Práglu pub, který alespoň trochu připomíná Státy, tak tady se vyřádíte. Jídlo v pohodě, pub jak z nějaké super díry v Tennessee. Doporučuji!
Pizza is great! Loved it. Got onions for the first time and thought it was amazing and I don't usually like onions. That could be a good or bad thing for those of you who do. Takes quite a while to get your food out but it's a good place to eat if you are ever in Hawthorne.
Unlike a couple other GBK locations in London the GBK in Putney seems slightly run down and cramped for space, however once you are greeted and welcomed by a member of staff the overall experience is a pleasant one. The staff friendly and the food has always been really good. If you are not in the mood for a traditional burger then I can highly recommend the falafel burger which is exceptionally tasty. The only negative for me, although I am probably being a little pedantic, is that the plastic tomato sauce(ketchup) bottles on the table always feel greasy and could really do with being cleaned once in a while.

I go here for juices! And boxed teas. Love them. The owners are really nice and the juice line moves fairly fast considering there's often 3 or 4 people waiting. Price are awesome - I get the Digestive and the Green Juice - it's about $11 total.
Really good food. If you want something different than your traditional burritos and crunchy tacos then this is a good place. The food is great. Cost is more than your typical taqueria but the food is much better. Try the mole with chicken and rice.

That wataburger restaurant place is been there for years that I had grew up going. Always had been a great service.
Way Motor Works did an excellent job with my repair. He's an honest guy and his assistant, Nola, was extremely friendly. He saved me a lot of money down the line by making some preventive repairs.

Jornalismo verdadeiro.. Band News FM é a minha rádio de cabeceira. Parabéns! Continuem assim, 'desengessados' e transparentes.
Okay, their big screens need updating. But, the service was great, our burgers and salads were very good and the beers were very resonable (happy hour). We watched the Thursday night NFL game there and it was only S44.32 for all four of us lots of beer and food for the price. I was so happy I left a S10.00 tip. It is a little rough around the edges.

Homesteads - Lincolnton, NC Quality - 4/5 Atmosphere - 4/5 Food Prices - 3/5 Alcohol Prices - 2/5 Service - 3/5 The food is great. It's the best quality restaurant in town. Food prices are fair. As far as alcohol prices, they are much higher than market area, although selection is far better than their competition. Service has many kinks. They are often very slow, even outside of peak times. To go time ranges are often off by 20-30 minutes past the projected times. Overall, its a good restaurant. Just be prepared to wait -- and then wait. But, it certainly is -- worth the wait.

4.0 stars. Best sleep I've had in a long time. Hampton Inns are often clean and updated, and this is no exception. The staff was all courteous and my room was quiet and clean. I requested a quiet room on the top floor away from the elevator, and couldn't even hear other folks. I'm usually very sensitive to noise, and there is no road noise here. The only downside is location--it's about 1.5 miles to downtown, but the drive is super easy. There are chain restaurants around here that will serve well enough, but I opted for a gourmet delivery service.

Kidz Play here is a great location to keep your kids entertained and occupied. The business is also locally owned. The staff and owners are very friendly. They make you feel welcome, the facilities are very clean, and they do what is needed to insure your time there is enjoyable. Whether it is going there for free play or one of their plan activities Kidz Play is always on our list of choices when thinking of things to go do with the kids. We havent taken advantage of this next thing in awhile, so not sure if they still offer it, but you can also leave your children there to go shopping, out to eat, movies or other - and with all that is around at Concord Mills area that is nice when you just want some time alone, or with your spouse.
The food and atmosphere are great! Servers are very nice, but there is never anyone at the front to seat us. We always wait a solid 5 minutes with staff buzzing by us without any acknowledgement.
Excellent food. The dal makhani is top class!
Nice experience especially with delivery our's was 5 minutes earlier than our window! Set up, and very nice. Good deal!!

Wonderful Place!! I really like here. I could enjoy not only wonderful view but also history.
Pilsner beer is very good. The roper sandwich and fries was awesome. The service was ok, nothing to write home about. Quite frankly, i believe this place blows away the Wind River Brewery in Pinedale Wy. which has very low quality of food at high price.

I had the ruben sandwich! It was delicious. This is where the trolley from the Samuel Adams tour stops after the tour. Definitely worth the trip.

This is a small place out away from everything, and in my opinion worth every second of the trip. Really interesting menu, with options for both normal and adventurous eaters. Nice wine list too, and very friendly staff. Like I said, its small, so during busy nights or seasons I'd suggest a reservation. Been there twice, and had a great experience both times.
I've been studying at Advance for a year and I like it! The school it's always trying to promote activities to get people to know each other, and this is great for those who are new in the city. I met really nice people here and I had (and still have) great teachers!

Fantastic place for kids of all ages. Loads of pools to choose from, great kids club. Rooms cleaned daily and towels changed. Evening entertainment leaves a lot to be desired and there's nothing to do after 11pn when the bar closes but all in all a great hotel. Need to be careful on the beach though as it's full of jellyfish
Great location for drinks and nibbles. Love the courtyard in the summer. Although the cobblestones play hacock with your heels. Cocktails are decent - not Baxter level - but good enough.
It is Hilton hotel new

An excellent place to stay for the Morro Bay area. Right at the freeway exit where Highway 1 meets the 41. Only downside I can think of is that the Breakfast is not exactly top of the line, but if you are a cereal eater and love non-fresh muffins, then you'll love it. Morro Bay has plenty of places to eat, so I'm thinking the free breakfast as an appetizer Market avenue (kind of like a Broadwalk area) is less than a 5 minute drive from the hotel. Highly recommended for its price and presentation.

This place gives you no jokes about what they offer, it is exactly as it is in their name. Wait staff keeps you with your drink of choice, they have sushi (which is my wife's favorite), they have every kind of americanized favorite chinese food dishes (general tso's, fried rice, mongolian beef EVERYTHING), and it's not terribly priced since you can eat to your hearts content.

I am greatly sadden that Dr. Skierka sold out to the Waverly Hospital. I left Dr. Brunkhorst because he too sold out. I feel sorry for Roger, because he can not find anyone who is willing to come into his office without ungodly high wages, which is not possible in a small town environment I dread the health care I will have to seek. I really dislike the big corporate health care places Terri Bertram

El lloc genial i el personal molt atent. El menjar del restaurant no esta a l'alçada del preu que cobren.
My husband and I are always looking for somewhere that offers healthy options in a fast service, low key atmosphere. Unfortunately this is not an easy task, even in large cities. So when I saw the name of this place “Designer Greens” I thought this had to be a place we would enjoy. The website drew us in with the first sentence that states that it is the place for an ultimate salad and sandwich experience that uses only the freshest ingredients. We went on a Sunday afternoon with our son. The restaurant was empty, which made me question what it was going to taste like. We were abit confused about the menu and how to order. I think had the employees assisted us better or explained the way the menu was set up then we would have ordered something different. Nevertheless, e both enjoyed our salads and will go back one day. I do think that there should be more options for the salad and a better way of seeing all the options when designing your own salad. But the portion size was large for the price. There were no drinks for children (no milk or juice just soda or tea) despite having a kids menu, which I found very odd. We will return because it was exactly as we hoped: a quick service, nearby restaurant that offers healthy custom salads and sandwiches. I only wish the employees were more friendly and helpful. Check out the menu!

Es el Centro Comercial Principal de Santa Cruz. Ventajas hay muchas: Múltiples Tiendas de ropa en un solo sitio Las Tiendas de las Principales empresas de telefonía están una al lado de otra, de manera que puedes decidir entre las ofertas y beneficios de cada una dando solo unos pasos, aunque deberían tener más personal para agilizar las colas. Hipermercado en la planta -1 Cines y Restaurantes en la última planta, Mi Preferido, Hay una Gran Variedad de comida: Rápida, Japonesa, Mexicana, Española, Turca, Italiana, Heladerías y más... No está de más decir que el estacionamiento es una de las principales ventajas de un centro comercial. No tienes que estar dando vueltas buscando aparcamiento
The best Thai food I've ever had, and I've enjoyed Thai food in many places. The spring rolls, golden bags, and other appetizers must have been freshly made, the ingredients were recognizable and the flavours were fresh and meshed together well. The fish balls were salty, but the flavour was delicious, more fresh ingredients, and they were NOT rubbery. The mango salad was good, though they leave out the chili flakes by default, which was a surprise. The bass fillet with snow peas, asparagus, and bamboo was light and flaky, with a lovely sauce. And all the same prices paid at average restaurants! Extremely good value for the money.

Visited the area for a week, and ended up visiting the restaurant 2x and ordering delivery 2x. The food is great! Portions are big and the food tastes fantastic. The staff is also super friendly. Also a great place to hang out on a sunday morning, eat their awesome AYCE brunch buffet, shoot some pool, and watch football. I will definitely miss this place.
Great for massage and chiropractic adjustments. The Year of Wellness is a wonderful deal, and allows you to get reasonably-priced massages and adjustments. Dr. Moyer (chiro) is great to work with. He asks for areas of focus and gives a quick, efficient adjustment. He also recommends exercises/stretches that make sense for the given injury. The massage therapists are great; I have had individual and couples appointments with several of them. They know what they are doing and check in to ensure the pressure/style is appropriate. Great organization, great prices, good location.

I have been there multiple times. They have good malt shop food at a reasonable price. The staff has always been friendly and attentive. Unlike another reviewer, I do not recall that they ever got my order wrong.
Tasty grill,good prices. The MOST kid-friendly place I know, without being offensive to people without kids because the third floor is a kid's restaurant.
I use to stop here right before work every once in awhile. The last time I stopped by I asked for a breakfast wrap. I have ordered these before, they rarely take more than 10 minutes to make, most of the time it takes a little over 5 minutes. The guy that took my order made me feel uncomfortable, and when they handed me a wrap after 17 minutes they did not apologize for the wait. I was late for work, but that was more my fault for not just leaving and bolting for work when i realized that there was no time. But seriously I will not be coming back there for food. There was a guy with glasses there, I liked him but I don't see him there anymore... sad.
I took my family of 7 to Copper Mountain Ski Resort during the week of Thanksgiving. 6 out of 7 had never been skiing before. I rented the ski's online at Christy Sports from the Copper Mountain website. Very simple to do and i saved 20% by doing it online. Upon arrival all the paperwork was done and the process of getting ski's and snowboards was simple. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. I would recommend this location to anyone needing equipment rental. Thank you for a pleasant experience.
I like this place a lot. It's a great place to see live music and get a drink. They serve food late also!
Great staff, keep up the good work Michelle.
The best asian food you can get here at chicago!

I was there in 2006, it was really good experience. Greetings from Italy
Extremely disappointed. Ordered the Filet black and bleu. They forgot the "black" part. I figured that chefs at an expensive steakhouse new how to cook steaks. I was wrong. The Wedge salad was swimming in blue cheese dressing. Ordered a side dish of asparagus and found it to be bitter to the point of being uneatable. Not ever going back.
Great variety. Gluten and dairy free friendly.
I take my maltepoo, Stormee, here almost on a daily basis. The staff is friendly, know my name and my dog's name by sight and are warm and welcoming. I like having the peace of mind that Stormee can be someplace and play all day and be cared for, rather than home alone while I'm at work. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a day camp for their pooch.

been going here long time. wish the trades were better, but that is the bad thing about a huge corporation. have friends that work there and don't get paid much at all.

Roccos Tacos in west palm beach was fantastic !!! From the decoration to quality of the food, and service. Certainly will be back soon.
I absolutely LOVE their sushi. I usually get the shrimp tempura roll and the veggie roll (with cucumber and avocado) and I ask them to use brown rice (you have to specify if you want brown). But the best part about this sushi is that it is made right as you wait, and the rice is warm. Everywhere else I've gone for sushi it's cold and there's too much fancy stuff going on (like cream sauces). Seasoned Wok's sushi is basic, but you feel like it's the healthiest stuff on the planet.
Location is incorrect. The school is slightly west where you see the football field, Union Lake, and the academic buildings and dorms.

Went to the car lot looking for something reliable, ended up not buying a car but Josh was very helpful and helped me to decide what worked best for me. Great atmosphere and they will work with everybody. Thanks Josh.
Very good food! Had the hummus and the burger. Food was excellent, just think the price might be a little far fetched.
I wanted to trade-in my 07 Honda Accord for a new vehicle. I came in on a Saturday night and worked with Mike. He asked me what I was looking for in a vehicle and told him. Due to the time of day, we couldn't get responses back from lenders, but he called me on Monday saying I was approved. I came back in and we checked out vehicles. I test drove a VW Jetta and a Toyota Scion. They were both quality cars. I chose the Jetta because the Scion was light blue, and I prefer black for my cars. Overall it was a good experience and I would recommend the place to anyone. Mike was a nice guy. There were some communication things that prevented it from going to five stars - -I was told over the radio and by Mike the first day I got there that the first payment would not be due until February. When I signed the paperwork, my first payment is due January 23. They could only do 45 days. - Vehicles are not labeled with prices. It took awhile for them to figure out the price on the Jetta. Granted the price was a lot less than what I thought it would be, but it would have been nice when window shopping to see prices. -I did however get more on my Honda than I thought I would, so that was nice. -The cruise control does not work. So I have an appointment next week to get it fixed. I was told that I would not be charged, even though it is not covered under warranty. Hopefully they stick to their word. -When I came in within 24 hours of the purchase to have them look at the cruise control, I said I wanted to maybe look at some other vehicles, as one of the rights of the buyers that they display on the main floor is "if you don't love your vehicle, you can exchange it in 24 hours". I mentioned that to Mike and he said it might be difficult to do since we already submitted the paperwork. As I waited for the tech to get back to me, Mike never followed up on my request to look at other vehicles. I was a little disappointed, but I'm happy with the Jetta, but didn't really have the bells and whistles that I wanted - Satellite radio, better MPG etc. The lady that did my paperwork didn't really seem like she wanted to be there, or maybe I caught her on a bad day. She didn't shake my hand. No customer service, just "sign this" and be out of here. Based on my credit, I had to put down $500 and only got $300 christmas check. So it is almost a wash, but the radio ad was a little misleading. Overall, I am happy with the service and the vehicle and would recommend the place, and I'll probably use them again. I did however feel the entire process was a little rushed to my liking - more customer service and attention to what I was looking for in a vehicle, and more customer service from the paperwork lady. But that is on me - next time when I get a vehicle and use them I am going to come in a list with everything I want and take my time looking for the perfect vehicle.
The kebap as it should be! Destan Style!
The burgers were excellent and our side dish was great. The ambiance was so so and kind of cramped. If you like a good burger, I would recommend to anyone.
I had a fantastic experience with China Wok. They took my order over the phone, for pick-up. They said 7-10 minutes, I got there in 8. My food was packed and ready. I ordered the garlic broccoli and the hot and sour soup (full order). The garlic broccoli was perfectly cooked and still had a wonderful texture, not mushy. The hot and sour soup could have been slightly hotter temperature wise, so i just hotted it up in a soup pot, it was well balanced in flavor. Most of all, the rice was light and fluffy, not sticky and pasted into a container. Bonus points, not one styrofoam container, super turnoff when they pop up. tip: if you are ordering at any restaurant between 11am and 1pm, or 5pm and 8pm, be prepared to wait, be prepared to have super busy people, trying very hard to help you and everyone else in the restaurant which is undoubtably full. have some consideration, just as you wish someone would do for you at your job when things are crazy and you just want to eat a cookie instead.
I agree the parking is bad, but the service is great i must say. As busy as they were they came outside and helped trouble shoot my electrical problems, and went even further to give me information on why my check engine light was on.
Zeer lekker gegeten aan een zeer democratische prijs!!!

We are approaching our 1 year mark here at Logan's Mill and it has been a mostly good experience. I'm writing the review since I relied heavily on them when I was first searching from across the country, and hopefully it will be a help to someone at some point. Logan's Mill has it's good traits and bad, like any, but for the price we pay for living I'd say the good traits decidedly outweigh the bad. Generally, I really love my home. To be helpful I'll talk about the few issues we have here, but just know I really feel we've lucked out living here thus far. The biggest issue- and I'm surprised I didn't read about it in all my research- is the TRAFFIC. If your morning commute has you leave before 8... it's just a nightmare. And I can only imagine that will be even worse with the school opening up right off 35 as well as new building that's supposedly going to be started next door. There's a lot of business around which is good, but again it can be a hassle getting anywhere here. Now, our rent is being raised and we are unsure about staying as the traffic is a daily issue. Other things that might bother possible future residents is the dog crap on the grounds seems to be out of control. It doesn't seem there is much management can do about it, but I think it's pretty necessary considering how gross it is. People seem pretty secluded in their places around here, so we haven't gotten to know anyone. There's the occasional shady character that appears, but as a 25 year old female I feel safe here. Those are all conditions outside of the apartment, and I am pretty satisfied when I'm inside my home. There's been some issues with the stove-top burners, freezer coldness, and the water has been shut-off a few times which is annoying, but management is decent about doing their job. You might have to press them to fix it right, but I guess that' been more of my boyfriend's job. Other than that, I love laying by the pool, the walk to the bus is quick, the initial rent was well worth-it, and Monica has been A-OK in my book. Like I said, I moved here from across the country and her and Jennifer ( who sadly I believe doesn't work here anymore) were more than helpful of giving me any information and working with me from a distance. The new girls seems, eh, OK, but I hope Monica can get her trained like Jennifer was. Anyways I hope this helps someone, I know it would've been very helpful for me!
I'm in my sixth month with CrossFit NYC and am overall very happy. Pros: * CrossFit has definitely changed me for the better in many ways * I am really happy with the quality of coaching -- my coach knows my strengths and weaknesses * The gym has a zillion classes a day, which is convenient Cons: * The classes can get very crowded, which is not only a hassle, but can also mean you don't get much coaching * You need to book multiple days in advance if you want to go right before work or after work * The showers are ok-ish, but the women's room gets like a jungle sauna

Just discovered they opened up near where I work and though I'd try them for lunch. Had an excellent enchilada suizas while my lunch companion enjoyed the tortilla soup! Service was friendly and efficient. They definitely will become one of our regular lunch stops. They are in process of constructing an outdoor street dining patio that looks nice.

Great place. Being that I love smoothies I come here almost daily. Smoothies are top quality, service is great, and the server Alli is pretty darn cute. Only have had some of their food. It's pretty good, but if you are looking for food I'd recommend other places. Their smoothies though are great!

TCB Painting gave us a great deal on getting our house painted, inside and out. They were punctual and quick with their service. Were a little messy with the paint outside in the yard, but overall they did a great job. Would recommend them to friends for getting the job done!
Both the bagels and pizza are very good. They have the best cream cheese I've ever had.
I moved out of a Hubbard Bowers property today and had a very painless move-out process with the maintenance manager, Anthony. He was punctual, respectful, and very personable during the walk-through of my apartment. I had several maintenance requests over the time period that I rented with HB and they were all filled in a timely and efficient manner. In my experience with other landlords, maintenance requests have been ignored or taken days-weeks to fix but their online tool makes appliance issues easy and quick.

Shula's hotel, either on Main St. or the golf course, is a great place to stay in Miami. The famous steak house is on the golf course, and is a must for red meat lovers. Staying in the Main St. hotel is nice because Miami Lakes is a delightful little town square, and you can wander around safely and marvel at our South Florida weather and delights while your friends are shivering back home.

these guys were great! They were cost efficient and handled everything with my move and i would recommend them to anyone I know moving to Vancouver as they do an excellent job. Thank you, guys!
You know when you have to wait for about an hour for breakfast it must be good food. This place is well worth the wait. With everyone's taste buds taken care of and reasonable prices. This is a place that became a regular for us after the first bite into my Cajun Eggs Benedict. Try them if you like the heat and you will not be disapointed.

Pretty good, except they need better air quality, better showers and updated changerooms. The upkeep needs to be a little better, the floors and pool deck can get pretty dirty. Awesome 50m pool though.
My sister came to visit Houston and I thought this would be a fun thing to do with her. We did the 3-hour trip and had a great time. The only drawback, which doesn't really reflect on the business, was that we were really sore afterwards. Looking back we probably should have stuck with the 1-hour trip. But, again, we had a great time. Horses were calm and very pretty! Signing in was quick and easy. We got our helmets on and were ready to go within 10-15 minutes of arriving.

True fast food that *will* fill you up! - Great value, great quality, fast service, brilliant menu - Higly recomended if you are in Liverpool city centre!
One of my favorite restaurants since coming to Omaha a decade ago. The owner is a very kind and good man who when we dropped by after we got married waived the cost of dinner as a wedding gift. Great bang for your buck and one of the few Omaha Chinese places to do a good job on crab rangoons.
Sans aucun doute les meilleurs sandwichs St Nectaire-Jambon de Pays de Paris Quelques bons petits plats de là bas-aussi Beaucoup de monde le midi
Good customer support with great service hours and competitive price.
This is a local favorite. It is run by two sisters, food is always good, fresh and there are veggie options.
Despite what everyone says I find this gym to be filled with nice people. Yes, at times it can get crowded but it's usually pretty mellow. I have been coming here since it first opened in February '13. They clean pretty regularly and they have stations where you can get freshwater and hand sanitizer. Locker room for women is pretty clean the only part I find is gross is their showers. Yuck! But they are nice. I don't see why people think it's got rude people or dirty machines.. perhaps they just haven't checked out the other nasty gyms that I've gone to such as 24 hour fitness and LA fitness.

dîner devant la cheminée ....
Very good service
Really good taste with a kind service, plus the convinience of delivery and you can order online
kim the bartender is way cool. & Paul the owner is almost always here to make sure things run smoothly.
Our two boys had routine visits scheduled where we found they would need some work done (fillings and extarctions). Due to some cancellations, there was actually time to do the work the same day we were there. No rescheduling, no anxiety, just done and moving on. So thankful Dr Scott could be so flexible.

I like this place a lot but if I go in the drive thru, I don't know if I'm getting everything I asked for. I ask them for the canes sauce and I don't get any. But the chicken is amazing and I love the toast and coleslaw

Great for outdoorsy kids. My daughter (four year old) had a blast trying to catch butterflies and playing in the rainforest.

Kori at Webtegrity did an awesome job on helping me get thru a couple of obstacles I was having trouble with. Kori listened to my problems and directed me to get it corrected. I am very pleased with the outcome, Thank You Kori! Overall, my experience was very good and very helpful
Located at Mutiara Damansara, in the middle of Curve, right opposite Ikea. Good place to stay if you're from other states and you're looking to shop at Ikea. Not to be confused with "The Royale Bintang Mutiara Damansara", which is at the western end of the Curve (just beside e-Curve mall) Plenty of restaurants, places to drink, and entertainment options all within walking distance. Ingress players will be glad to know that there are at least 20 portals all within walking distance of this hotel :D

These guys provided all the fresh flowers for our wedding. They were super friendly and really worked with us to come up with ideas and create something unique that reflected my husband and myself. The first estimate they provided was too high, but we were able to work with them and they brought the number down significantly and still produced some high quality work. Will recommend.

Awesome place to enjoy vacation as well as organising conference. Loved the Swedish food :)
Not really a traditional Thai restaurant and the food has a modern, crisp style that I've never had when actually IN Thailand, but boy is SEA Thai yummy. And relatively inexpensive. Never been disappointed.
They have a great shelter program and really help people ... they also have a soup kicthen that anyone can go eat at

The staff always welcomes me with a smile. They are friendly, helpful, and project the qualities I expect in the staff of a Hilton or Wyndham property. The rooms are a bit dark, but opening the privacy shades during the day resolved this issue. The rooms are clean. The Eel River Brewing Company Restaurant and Bar is directly across the parking lot and provides a 10% discount when you show them your room key. Rooms have simple amenities, but they are all well-kept and functional. Wireless Internet is available and works consistently well. This is definitely the place to stay when visiting Fortuna.

My first taste of San Francisco was at the Frjtz location in the Mission District. Their crepes and burgers are good, but their fries are where it's at. Add some of the dips (the chipotle and strawberry mayo especially) and you can make a meal out of just those!

Brought in a Pontiac G6 covered in road salt and crud for a wash, charged $15 for the deluxe wash, which is probably the best way to go. The staff direct you to guide your car in position, then spray down and scrub bugs and heavy grime on the front end. The tunnel covers everything from a prewash to a teflon postwash (not sure exactly what effect it had, still going to wax the thing afterwards) but the final results were well worth the fifteen dollars. Pulled out afterwards to vacuum the interior and the vacs are quarter driven- kind of a letdown for a credit/debit world. Staff guiding the car when getting into tracks were efficient, though a little overcommanding. Overall, I'd go back with quarters to vac the interior, but the deluxe wash is well worth fifteen bucks.
Whats INSIDE is what counts. This hotel isnt much to look at from outside. The neighborhood is iffy, and the traffic on the street is loud. But the indoors is classy, slightly dated, but the service is great. Everyone was super helpful and friendly. The room was CLEAN. Like I said, the carpets and furniture in the lobbys and halls is old, but the rooms were spacious and clean, and well insulated from noise. I was very comfortable here! and a standard room came with fridge and microwave. The complimentary shuttle was driven by a very friendly man, who knew the area well, and it runs in the morning, and the evening. It made going out for the day very convienent for us. Money well spent. I would suggest this one to anyone!

Service very friendly. easy access to the highway. Food tasty.
An old favorite. Never disappointing.
The service provided by clear view is operator dependent . In the past and today we received good service from good and patient workers. Trevor , today, was very professional and did his job to my full satisfaction. However, in the past , we had encounters with plumers working for clear view that were not professional.Moreover , the administrators of clear view supported this lack of professionalism to our dissatisfaction.

Часто ходим всей семьёй в этот кинотеатр. До последнего киносеанса ни разу не возникало претензий. Кресла удобные, качество изображения хорошее, из любой точки зала экран хорошо просматривается. Только вот последний раз были какие-то проблемы со звуком. Надеюсь их вскоре устранят.
Lumayan bnyak pilihan dan harga terjangkau. Paling penting nasinya

We've always had good luck here. My family has "very long hair," and they are always respectful of our desire to keep it that way. They also put kids at ease, moreso than the kid-cut places ever did, in my experience.

Takoba has long been one of favorite East Side eateries, but lately it's popularity has kept me away. I love the variety of drinks- it's hard to find a good caipirinha in Austin! And most likely if you're here on the weekend, you'll have to spend some time at the bar before there's a table ready for you. Check out the chill space behind the restaurant - with firepits and colorful Adirondack chairs to relax beforehand. There's a bar at the back that rarely has a line! As far as food, I love their twist on the el pastor tacos, and their tomato soup with blue cheese is slurp worthy! Great brunch place also with legit mimosas. I'd recommend it but don't show up starving, cause it'll be a while.

Excellent local cafe. Enjoy cupuccino, espresso, frappe etc
Originally what they did was they came and gave me an estimate and they cleaned my house from top to bottom and now they just maintain it. So it`s easier for them, and it`s easy for me. The price is great, they have great products.
Food was delicious, prices were a bit high.

Ein Stück Gastronomie Erlebnis in Freiburg. Die Bedienung wurde sicherlich mit dem Bau des Hauses eingestellt und ist einen Besuch wert. Sitzen und nur trinken geht nicht und wird scharf abgestraft. Aber wer geht auch in einen Gasthof nur um zu trinken? Klare Ansagen verlangen klare Bestellungen, dann läuft es auch mit der Bedienung. Essen aus der Tageskarte (Spanferkel) war sehr gut, hat zwar fünf Minuten länger gedauert, waren es aber auch wert. Ein Stück Urigkeit in Freiburg, Prädikat sehenswert.

Casual place to bring a group - picnic tables outside are especially nice. Do the Fried Pickles and the Fried Chicken tacos - a must. Boiled peanuts are an acquired taste. The Flatbread was also pretty awesome and good to share. I tried the Black Bean Burger because I was trying to be "healthy" - good, but I would have just gotten the Fried Chicken tacos on a normal day. I got a Georgia Peach cocktail which was one of the best drinks I've ever had! Served with a grilled peach on top.
I've bought a number of Musical instruments here over the years. I love and easy to play the any Music instruments and it’s my hobby. I have a plenty musical instruments in my home. Musical instruments are an important part of the culture represent in this erudition hub. While the instruments diverge from one culture to the next and are made from vastly different resources.
Electronic key died, both of them, I called and asked for price for a new key and was told $75.00. Nothing was mentioned about programming, Went to dealer,.was told the non-electronic key was $75.00. I said can i use this to start the car and they did not explain clearly. 30 minutes later I had a key that only opened the doors and trunk. I was told programming was $50.00, for 1-999 keys. After discussing with the service manager, he reduced the price to $25.00 for the programming.

We eat here every Sunday. Generous portions of good food. The Coffee Cake is a MUST!
Um lugar calmo e um ambiente perfeito para conversar.
I was running late to arrive before they closed so I called to ask and they said 7:00PM. I did not have a reservation and was told there were plenty of sites left just come on. I arrived at 7:15PM and they were still open because of the few calls they received from others running late too. So needles to say I was very please they remain open for me to check in for a site they told me was one of their best. "Sure I thought" but they were right the site was great with a small stream behind it with a slight water fall made the night sound perfect for getting a good nights sleep. The shower house was very clean and sort of dated for the mens but the women's showers are brand new.. Which makes me think the mens is next for updating. The price is great with convent portable toilets close to the tent sites. I will vist again and recommend other too

I go to this place mainly for the environment, love their tables outside. I've never been too fond of their food but wouldn't go as for as to say it's not good. Every time I have been there the service has been good.
The staff was wonderful. The area was open and clean, the facilities were nice, not too dirty but not too clean, but you're camping so what do you expect? We just got back and are already planning our next stay. We recommend this site to anyone looking to go float the river or get outdoors.

Short review: this place is great as a short get-away and for small hikes. If you have 30 minutes to kill, come her and walk about a bit. I've been coming here since I was a child. 20 years later, it's still magical to me. I come here now for basic exercise and to get my daily dose of nature. The nature center is an "unimproved" conservation site, meaning it's essentially left to the elements with regular trail clearing and maintenance and non-native species removal. You're not going to see something as exciting as a Bobcat here, but there are plenty of wood peckers, owls, wrens, and hawks throughout the area. The plant life is fun too. There are something like 8 trails, the longest of which takes about 20 minutes to hike. If you're looking for a low-lying and easy trail, stick to the stream and main road, it will take all of 15 minutes. If you're looking for views, check out Roadrunner Ridge, Bluebird Trail, and Wren Way, if you take all three they'll take about 40 minutes total to walk. Don't forget to bring a bag to pick up trash along the way. There isn't much at all, the maintenance at this park is really up to par, but it's always a good idea to pick up a little as well.

Do you know what is worst than waking up with hangover? Waking up with hangover in your own house and realize that the party last night was rockin and you have to clean all the mess. After sitting for a while and thinking from where to start a brilliant idea came to me. To use professional cleaner. That is what I did. I called Expert Carpet Cleaner and after several hours there was no trace from the party. The price I paid was nothing compared with the work they did. Really using professional cleaning company was my best solution.
I shopped around a lot before I purchased a Club Car from Fairway Golf Carts. I feel that I was treated fairly and the staff was very knowledgeable. I would purchase from them again but the Club Car I bought seems very well made so I think it will last along time. The showroom was a little cramp with all the Carts for Sale, but was very clean. They had a very good selection of carts to chose from.
I have enjoyed living here so far! The staff here are friendly and attentive (for the most part) and are quick to respond to your needs. If you have a maintenance issue, the maintenance guys will probably have fixed your problem that same day or within 2 days. The complex is in a convenient location as well, down the street from the heart of Carrboro and directly on the J line and across the street from the CW line. The complex is still undergoing renovations however, and that can result in some incredibly loud noises and unsightly landscaping. If you have to work night shifts and sleep in the day like I do at times, you'll find out, it's extremely annoying. The walls are also a bit thin and I do hear my neighbors sometimes. Given the cheap rent though, it's a very good deal for a newly renovated place. Unfortunately the rent increases after your lease ends and it can be pretty steep.
I live in the next town in Winnsboro and Classic Lanes is defiantly the place to go for a fun date night or a girls night out. I love the whole place, from the fun arcade and pool table in the back to the laser tag and bowling in the front! The food and drinks are good prices. Also there is a smoking room for adults while your kids play.
Excellent coffee ... A little sluggish on service . but the ambience is awesome ... Must visit
The place went under new management not too long ago. It used to be horrible, but now it's great. The girls who cut your hair are always friendly and know exactly what they're doing. I highly recommend going here.

They did some great work at my house and I'm so impressed with the final result. The guys were extremely motivated with a positive attitude. My wife did turn to many expensive cleaners hoping to clean the carpets, but there was no good result, they just managed to blur the spots and nothing more. The prices are really affordable.

Não tem pra ninguém, desde que a Planeta Proibido fechou as portas, só existe um lugar onde os jogadores de RPG e os amantes do mangá podem se encontrar (fora a casa de Cultura Mário Quintana, é claro...)!
A decent dealership. However I had to return to the dealership to set the tire pressure monitors after having a tire rotation... this has happened a few times. Great prices on service, far less than greasemonkey.
It was good fresh! Samurai sushi in Fullerton ca is way better
Always a nice experience. Ruby is pleasant and has a great staff. Always enjoy the facials and definitely the massages here. Would recommend!
Great dinner and drinks!
Always have a good night at the Hexagon. A good variety of shows. Very affordable.
I was very pleased with my experience with Bridal Fantasy. I had began my wedding search at bridal fantasy and decided to look other places, but came back to bridal fantasy. They have a great selection, affordable dresses and helpful and not overly pushy consultants. They even sent a thank you card after I had purchased my dress.
My mom and I had a fantastic time today at the body blitz spa on Adelaide.She's visiting all the way from Romania, I decided to surprise her with a full body treatment and relaxing sea salt waters for Thanks giving day. She loved it! Friendly staff, everyone smiling and helpful, we'll be back soon. I wish you guys would have more choices of body treatments and spa music at the pool. I'll see you guys again before my mom leaves;). Thank you guys1
Service is good...but for some reason the door to the place slams shut behind me. It is pretty loud in a room that is quiet..Please fix the door...A little surprised it has been this way for months.
You have to go in with the right expectations -- it's a diner, folks! The insanely varied menu is part of the appeal. We love to come here with our finicky boys, who always eat a cheeseburger and fries, which look and taste the way they expect them to, yet my husband and I have lots of options to choose from. Maybe burgers, maybe salads, omelets, whatever. The variety is especially nice because we don't get tired of coming here like we do if we've been to an Italian/Sushi/Thai/Whatever restaurant too many times in a row. The Big View Diner is DEFINITELY kid-friendly, and we have always received outstanding service. Desserts are yummy, too -- so sometimes we just go for pie or ice cream sundaes.
buen ambiente,muy rico, comida justa y buenos precios, la bebida algo cara, repetiremos.
Excellent smoked-meat, on par if not better than Schwartz. Service is O.K. but not exceptional. Go there for the smoked-meat and you won't be deceived. For me the best in town.
A late morning snack and coffee with 2 friends. Place was busy but service was excellent the staff friendly and courteous and quality of food very good. Good venue with quality food and service and we enjoyed the ambiance.

I'm so sorry these people had such a bad experience. My husband and I stayed at the White House Motel and were very satisfied, indeed. The first room we checked did have a smoky smell but they were happy to change our room to a lovely appointed and very clean room. This is not your generic chain motel so I expect to find flaws but found none. This is a family run motel and the family was very accommodating. The grounds were like walking through a botanical garden. Simply lovely. Included in the $40 per night price (including 17% tax) was free internet access, free phone use, and cable TV with HBO. Oh, and I must mention the GREAT Bar-B-Q place across the street. I posted their information on facebook and I'm writing this review because I travel frequently and want to let people know when I find a hidden gem. The White House Motel is a hidden gem.
I feel that Pepito Carlmann was very helpful and courteous. And we are grateful. Alfredo and Lupe Salazar

I liked it because the food was good (i ordered pizza so it better be!) ;-) and it was quiet enough so I could hear the business conversation I was having.
Our visit with Cosmo has been a good one. It can be pricey and nothing may become of it. Work is not guaranteed. Let's face it, it's Louisville - not New York City or LA. Work is very limited here if at all. BUT for your money, which is less than other agencies by THOUSANDS of dollars that we have checked out, it's not a bad deal. For about $34 a month (which is what the lump sum averages out to) you get 2 years of representation and a CD of pictures for portfolio. No other monies are asked for as long as you pay in full. I know people who have agents in NYC and headshots and portfolio pictures alone are $1500. So nobody will truly represent you for free. Even if they don't charge to represent you, they will get your money somehow. I went into this knowing that nothing may become of it more than a few hundred pictures. I was not promised the world. Nor do I expect it. If we don't get work in two years, we simply won't sign again. I don't get why everyone is so upset. Nothing is guaranteed. So far it's been a good experience and at least I have pictures I can take to places outside Kentucky when we travel. Never know what might happen.
Nine of us went for dinner, the service for drinks was a little slow at first but soon caught up...served kids first so they were happy. The food was very well presented & very tasty. Wine list was vast. Atmosphere was a little noisy. Tables need a bit of attention. 8/10
The menu is a bit limited, but it's pretty decent Chinese takeout (or casual dine-in). I recommend the steamed dumplings and the pepper-steak. Fair prices, clean environment, safe from clowns.
In varansi it is good maal .
We have really enjoyed our membership - taken great trips we definitely would not have taken otherwise. We "gifted" our kids with their choice of weekend trips for their birthdays one year and I can guarantee you, they will remember those birthdays more than they'll ever even *think* about some cheapy toy they got for other birthdays and probably broke within a few days. We traveled to Sun River/Bend, OR, Ocean Shores, WA, Idaho near Silverwood Theme Park, and enjoyed our wedding anniversary in beautiful Lake Tahoe, CA, and those were all just "local" places we could drive to. There are many many other places we have in mind to travel to once we can afford to add in airfare to the plans. :)
Mario was very informative and professional. Did a great job!
If you are looking for some home cooking this is the place. Fried pie day is the BEST!

I have been in Austin for 17+ years. KB is not Starbucks. It feels much more like an Austin local coffee shop, and that is how I like it. There are many events hosted in the shop so you can not always keep sitting and read your books. On the other hand, I feel they are trying to be/provide a local community hub, and I like it. Both coffee and tea are very decent. I just tried their pizza. It was actually pretty good... Due to its location, it is not yet overpopulated by studying students. It actually does feel like a coffee shop :) It is pretty loud during event, but pretty quiet otherwise. Just be aware of events (there is a calendar on their web page).

The best thing about Cool Al's is that you are not paying for ambiance, just awesome food. Every time I go I get a different burger and have always walked out thoroughly satisfied. Expect a wait of at least 20 minutes since they hand-make your patty when ordered, especially if you have it stuffed with bacon, peppers, etc.
very tasty
We enjoyed very much and stay at hotel malige food and service is excellent
Great tourist area especially for those new to NZ
My favorite theater in the area by far. I've never had a problem with the staff or the video/sound quality. If you work a strange schedule they have $6.50 showings before noon during the week.

Golden Palace has the best "Springfield Style" Cashew Chicken in town. The only other places that are as good as them would be Shanghai Inn, and Canton Inn. Also, Golden Palace has a real good General Chicken. The chicken is always fresh and lightly battered. The Crab Rangoon is lights out, it has a slight sweet flavor to it. I wasn`t a fan of the Egg Rolls, they seem to be store bought from the freezer section. They crank the Coke products which is a good thing. I go there at least one to two times a week. A much needed addition to southeast Springfield.
I'm having a great time in the RCI condo exchange here. I'm on the 4th floor, and have used the kitchenette for several days to make breakfast, brunch and dinner. The location can't be beat for the price in Waikiki--we are adjacent to Dukes' Lane and across Kuhio Ave. from the International Market and an ABC store. Maybe people from outside Hawaii don't realize what things cost in Honolulu? I have found the staff to be friendly and the room (an efficiency studio with murphy bed) clean and comfy and more than adequate. The fact that I can wheel myself to the beach in my wheelchair in less than 10 minutes is a plus! Yes there is city noise--turn up the fan at night folks! Point it away from you if you don't want the breeze!
Purchased a pedal from Brad, great experience and very convenient! Will definitely be coming back.

They have always taken very good care of us.
Carousel, barbeque, a sandy beach, fountains, and a big lawn. Nice views. Easy access to hoboken.
Awesome food!!
Best Pizza I've ever had. I don't normally like thick crust, be there's is incredible. The dinning experience casual and a bit noisy, but the food is great. I love their bread but, If there was one thing that I could change it would be the little frozen butters wrapped in aluminium foil. Get some decent spreadable butter and its perfection.

The rooms are nice, the pool and hot tub are okay. The gym is very nice for a hotel, better than most. However, the cleaning service is useless if your staying for a few days. And the people that work there are zombies.
Probably the best pizza in Quincy.
My daughters have been going to Eastside orthodontics for many years and the staff always welcomes us like old friends. I am confident that their smiles will be our reward for all the time invested. The cookies and coffee are an added bonus while we wait as are children are being worked on. My daughter adds ,"I love the friendly staff and I just got my braces off and I have a beautiful smile now.They also have yummy cookies while you wait and hot chocolate in the winter months which is still good in South Florida:)

We go there a few times a month for a beer and a sandwich. Good food and nice selection of beers and ales. Wine prices are reasonable as well. Last night we had a pizza. (Mondays 1/2 price night) Sausage, pepperoni, and mushrooms. I think it's my new favorite pizza. Thin crust, perfectly baked, fresh ingredients (at least they tasted like it, but since I didn't make the pie I don't know for sure) and perfectly seasoned. Everyone has a different taste in pizza, but this one is a home run in my book.
Would probably seem like a chain-type restaurant, if you're from the U.K. But if you're not, or have never been, you'll enjoy it. Has a pub-style decor and shows soccer (football) and rugby, etc. on its TVs. The food was good - and the service was fast and our waitress responsive. There probably was not anything that knocked my socks off and makes me die to come back here, but I would return.
You've heard it before, about every top Thai restaurant: "this is the most authentic Thai food; so close to what they have in Thailand". You've also heard the detractors "Rubbish, you must come to 'x' to experience true Thai food". Unfortunately neither is true, you will not (or very rarely) find authentic Thai food outside of Thailand let alone Sydney. Having said that, this does not preclude a restaurant from serving Thai that is a cut above the rest both in taste and quality and that's exactly what Home Thai does. You'll wait a long time and fight many contestants for the privilege of eating here but it'll be worth it for while you may leave a bit heavier, your pocket won't have lost a proportional amount of weight. So no, you won't get 'authentic' Thai food but you will get some of Sydney's best for the price in an atmosphere at least that is strangely somewhat reminiscent of Thailand. Put simply, you want good Thai? Come here.

We dined there last Thursday evening and the place was very popular. I had the seafood Pasta Olio and Barbs had her usual salmon cutlets. I thought the seafood pasta was brilliant with just the right balance of pasta, oil and sea food. The octopus and scallops were perfectly cooked - mine host Leo was very attentive dividing his time between the customers, cash register and new grandson who was there with his daughter and son in law at the next table - we got introduced!
Changed the catalytic converter and did a engine tune up. Price is good. Drove for several months. The car does feel a lot better than before.

Located right across the street from Coca Cola Field, it's a perfect location for baseball fans attending Bisons games. Many craft beers on tap (try Curveball!) and the food was great. I really enjoyed my Mexican Burger, which is a little weird in an Irish Pub, but whatever. Prices were good, service was good, and the free WiFi is perfect for us visiting Canadians!
Manara Cafe is excellent. The food is homemade and very good. I highly recommend the chicken shawarma. I will most definitely be back.

Excuse me Mister "I'm an Indianapolis German", but they aren't German, they are Amish and the Amish speak a German Dutch mix, therefore you cannot tell them that they are wrong.

I crave a lot of their chocolate covered items here. They're all huge, and loaded with lots of chocolate, like the chocolate covered granola, chocolate covered cayenne and lavendar, chocolate covered coconut cookie, and a whole bunch of chocolate covered dried fruits. AHHH. It's perfect for my that time of the month, when I feel like the world hates me, my life sucks, and I feel the need to really evaluate my self. and blah blah blah. You know womanly troubles. It's not a dessert place, it's more of a healthy lunch spot. They have really skinny sandwiches, that seem small and expensive, but most of the time they're really tasty. There are also soups, salads, and other things, that I don't usually try. I just get the desserts and the sandwiches. I really enjoy them. I also was able to pick up a few dessert items here for my old boss, who had gluten, dairy, and animal product allergies. Also please note that it's good to know what you want to order very quickly. This place can fill up fast during the lunch hour, and other people can sometimes end up ordering before you, and even though you were in the front of the line, everybody else can get their order before you, because they already knew what to order. If that doesn't bother you, then you really don't have to worry about it.
Subs are hot and delicious. My favorite pizza from here is the Taco pizza, yum-yum.
hemos caido por casualidad y resulta que es uno de los mejores sitios de Cuenca
Truly one of the best delivery places going. Eating in is also great. So kid friendly. My daughter followed our server all about the restaurant much to her and our servers delight. Thanks!
Good food and service, value lunch deal.
Great place to enjoy a beer and whatever sports game is on. Went to Iron Hill to watch the Eagles game and it was surprisingly not too crowded. I sat down with a friend and our server was named "Chris", he was great. He went above and beyond what we asked for and if we had a question about a beer he was there with an answer. I enjoyed some of the special IPA's that they had. Got wings and spicy chicken tacos...both were great. All and all not badly priced got 5 beers and food and the bill came out to be $50. Highly recommend going for a night out.

A little pricey... But great staff and inviting atmosphere
okay - it's not a lavish resort - our room was big, bathroom huge, and unlike the other guy, wookie, plenty of hot water. the GOOD: 24 hour room service, card grants you access to only your floor, they don't allow loud crazy people in rooms, the food was good, i had wings and cheesecake at JavaCafe. staff was nice, ice machine convenient. covered parking with a cat walk to guard ya from the elements. the BAD: (not thaaat bad) a lil dirt on the comforter, the chair and foot stool were stained (just a spot) the shower curtain was frayed a lil and a few of the stations on the tv didn't work - couldn't order a movie. one thing i did also notice - our coffee station was missing stir sticks - it'd been opened, they were removed - and it's probable that the staff didn't notice it on clean up. it's an older place, smells a bit like smoke as most of the casinos do - but it's nice for what it is. i'd say built in the early 90's? limited updates but for 67 bucks - it's worth every penny. The snooty kids'll not be fan but the less fortunate not in the habit of having the latest and greatest will enjoy it juuuuuuuuuuust fine. it's free drink btw - while you gamble - if ya hate the room that much - go have a few more drinks and ya probably won't even notice. i'll def stay there again.
This is a very inconspicuous restaurant with excellent food. Make a reservation and be prepared to pay a little more for a meal that sets the standard for steak. We stumbled upon Red Gable while celebrating our anniversary in Saundusky. I would recommend this to anyone who appreciates fine dining. The ambiance is very subtle, but relaxing. Service is terrific and again, the food is amazing. You won't be disappointed.

The front staff was very knowledgeable and helpful... The dr. helped by using "layman's" terms.. for my son's 1st visit he was very comfortable with the assitant that helped us and the Dr. made sure to explain his prescription to me to help me understand why he may get his letters mixed up at school. The selection that my insurance would cover was very limited and I wish I was told "for $20 more you could look on this rack" etc...
The bar is a hit or miss, but they have absoultely the best chicken strips ever.
They have a HUGE selection of burgers & they are almost too big for one person to eat, cooked perfect! Love love love it!!

Service was A++. All staff were superb, but the chap in his 30's was especially attentive, chatter - but not over familiar. The food was very good, we opted for the menu rather than the menu, and in trust the portions were too big (we took the remains back in a doggy bag!). The only fault I have is I wish it was my local restaurant in the North East of England - we were down in Bradford staying the night to drop son off at airport on the Sunday. Lovely place, lovely food, lovely people and very reasonable.
I went to Rydell Honda Nissan to buy my first car and I was intimidated before I got there, but after meeting Ryan I was put at ease. I knew going in that buying a car was going to be difficult, I had some previous dings on my credit and I was worried that I wouldn't be able to find a car I could afford. However, Ryan worked with me and my finances to be able to find the best car for me in my price range. He was willing to help out when necessary and find me the best fit. I would absoultely recomend going and seeing him and other at Rydell's when you need to buy your next car. It was a great experience and they are able to do what is best for you!

We've hired the piano movers since we have one it was complicated since our door is small one and it was extremely hard to move it out but still the guys did their best and moved it. Thank you guys without you I am not sure we could have done it!
This place has everything!!
The food was great as all Buca's generally are. The atmosphere was also great. The service was a bit slow, but it was over all a good dining experience.
Great people and a great breakfast for a reasonable price. Worth a visit. Every table is different, the owners must be from the 70's as the music is fun, table settings all different, etc. Hubby and I enjoyed our first visit and will go back. Peace!
This is a great place and right in my neighborhood. I recommend it. But today I had an interesting experience. I went there for lunch and ordered a Reuben sandwich. The menu said "Pastrami, cheese and sauerkraut." Great. I asked the waitress if there was any spread/mustard/mayo on it and she said no. Great. Got the sandwich and it had thousand island on it. I showed the waitress and she said, "That's the sauerkraut." I thought maybe the sauerkraut was mixed in with the TI but when I looked there really was no sauerkraut at all. I asked her if I could have it remade with no TI and added sauerkraut. She said, "We don't really have sauerkraut." So I had a Reuben with no sauerkraut. Took half home and added my own. Delicious! Don't let this deter you....but if you want a real Reuben, ask if they have sauerkraut yet.
+my six year old loved this place ! the first time we went we stayed for five hours .He was sweaty the entire time from all the fun fun he was having .3 days later he was asking to go again . I liked that they had WIFI and great seating areas .I thought it would be the kind of place that you and a girl friend could hang out for coffee and just let the kids have a great time with out having to worry about where they were every second of the outing . We did find it expensive though ,and thought that family passes could make it more affordable for families to go more often .

Important Business Spot of Trichy
I brought in my 2009 Silverado for a regular oil and filter service. Service was excellent - I did try to set up an appointment but it was recommended that I use the Quick Lube. Unfortunately this was my biggest concern. An appointment means I can take the car in and pick it up - minimal fuss and I can plan my day. The quick lube was very busy, and it was a 2 hour wait. I brought work with me to do in the showroom so all was not lost (internet was not working though even though it was supposed to be). They did offer to drive me home and pick me up, but I just prefer having a plan - knowing when my car will go in and be ready. I would prefer to schedule my car for service. Still, the experience was very good and I was happy with the service I received. They did a very good job, which likely explains how busy they were when I came in. Staff were very friendly and I did enjoy seeing the new cars. I will go back but I will make an appointment. Price was good. I actually asked for the tires to be rotated - they suggested I didn't need it as wear was equal on all four - saving me $$. Nice touch and appreciated.

Great rooftop view of Sixth with a giant sized jenga up there. The "martinis" are delicious and quickly intoxicating. They have some of the best happy hour drink and food specials, even on Fridays! This is one of my favorite girls night out places as the tapas selections are huge and the ultimate girly drinks of fruity martinis.
همه چی خوبه اما بهتر میتونه باشه
Don Toston is just a block away from our business and they have become our go-to spot for lunch. Their home-cooked-style food hits that spot but doesn't break the bank. Just like mine, this business is a family-run operation. Richard and his team are great people and have been a great addition to the neighborhood. I encourage all our customers to cross the street - over to Don Toston - if they're hungry. Never has anyone come back disappointed.
I have to say this dealership stepped up to the plate and redeemed themselves after my bad experience. You know the old saying that "one bad apple can spoil the bunch", well one good apple can impact an organization for the better as well. Our salesman, Jay Coats,was able to work us out a good deal on my new Camaro and I am thankful for not closing the door and missing out on getting this car. In spite of the obstacles I initially faced with a less than hospitable experience, Jay was able to wash all the negativity away and put me in the car at a descent price. He is kind and gracious ( two things that are rare to find these days). I love my new car, and I would recommend Jay Coats at Powers Swain Chevrolet if you are in the market for a new car to others. Thanks Jay!!

The first pest prevention people I've been involved with but so far I couldn't be happier. I've looked into pest prevention programs before and it never seemed worth the cost. Alterra goes beyond the normal spray and pray, and knocks out visible issues with pests as well as puts out a prevention coverage that exceeds what I've seen offered anywhere else. Aaron came out today and swept all the spider webs out of my eaves during his visit and removed a wasp nest to keep them from setting up in my home. My entire outside is covered now, and Aaron even sprayed around inside my garage to get rid of spiders. My wife is arachnophobic and I am so glad to have a company so dedicated to helping calm her down about the spiders and other bugs. Thank you Aaron and thanks Alterra for your hard work and great value!
We had a very nice lunch here. The quality of the ingredients and food were very good the one slight let done is the menu is a bit of a greatest hits and there isn't much on there that you wouldn't get in most decent Italian restaurants. The building itself is fantastic and if you get a chance to see the vault room this is a must.

I liked the place and the tasty sushi but we waited to much time for the roll to come out. I will back here, i just hope the service will be faster .
I ordered a trailer hitch and had it installed. Larry answered all my questions. He was helpful and patient. We found a good time for my schedule and there were no unpleasant surprises.
I enjoyed my Caesar salad. Nice restaurant with plenty of food to choose from. Plenty of parking, too.
Come for the coffee, stay for the internet (best in the city), leave if you have to go to the bathroom (scariest in town).
Buen diseño e infraestructura, buena música para pasarla bien y deliciosos aperitivos. Si van no olviden probar la RES.

Food is wonderful, service is pretty terrible. They are very nice, but the servers always seem very disorganized and unaware of whats going on. Service is slow. Luckily I've never had a food order wrong.
Příjemná obsluha, skvělé jídlo, dobrá plznička.
Fantastic vegan options with fast and friendly service
Something about this location gets rough at checkout. Their inventory is pretty standard but I feel like they never have enough people on check out.
Nice Place to be in touch with the nature amidst the hectic city life. Lot of scope for improvement.
Good caring staff
Good range of trucks available if you're moving house. They also have everything you need for moving day, straps, hooks trolleys etc
Very nic regious place with great natural inviorment. It's really very good

Jubliee park is a awesome park for hanging out with friends(:
Good Food! The Guacamole was really good, and the chips were fresh. Will return as my go to Mexican restaurant, The Decor was pretty good, but needs more Mexican flare! Statues, colorful knickknacks, etc can never have enough colorful suns!

Although this chemist is not open at the weekend, it is a really friendly and helpful shop. The staff order my prescriptions for me and are knowledgeable about health issues.
Ich war schon ein paar mal hier. Es war immer alles gut. In der Umgebung gibt es für Steaks keinen besseren. Und ich habe einige probiert. Einzig die drei Parkplätze auf dem Hinterhof sind zu wenig. Aber auch das ist meckern auf hohem Niveau. Für einen Parkplatz musste ich nie lange suchen.
Great food and awesome service. Love the choices. I've been going there for years and will stop for the avocado subs.

Essen ist top jedoch ist das essen etwas zu teuer
When I made an appointment to get the windows on my truck stripped and tinted I was a little uneasy because they only do strip jobs first thing in the mornings. However, they were very courteous and very quick. They got the two front windows redone in about 45 minutes. The only reason they got a very good rating instead of excellent is their lack of an answering machine. I called during their lunch hour but was unable to leave a message. However, they did call me back, apparently they have caller id, and I was able to make an appointment. Also, they built their price with the tax included so the price they tell you is the final price. This was a huge bonus.
My wife loves your poi! Anyone carry it in Las Vegas? Mahalo!
This clinic operates in the morning and evenings and I went to consult for a fever that persisted for 3 days... Doctor looked knowledgable and charged nominal.
Great food, My husband and I went to celebrate an early valentines day. The food was delicious. I had the Tuna, and it was some of the best I had ever had (which is a lot). We will definitely be going back!
I love this place, it used to be Whineo's and was famous for being super cheap for beer. So when it changed hands and I went here I was surprised at what a change they had made and still managed to keep prices very low. I can't help but order the same dish over and over as it is soooo good. I get the Half a Bird with a side of fries, Lots of food and the gravy is amazing, my only critique would be for even more gravy as it's so nice :)

Top notch bar food! Wings are delicious and burgers definitely are worth the money. Has probably the best selection of beers in town. Get the Franziskaner Draft and the night will be your friend. Very friendly bartenders that know their regulars.
I didn't find this place nearly as horrid as the other reviewers did. My husband and I decided to give the place a try anyway and I'm glad we did. Likes: The food was excellent quality, good quantity, hot and came to us within a very reasonable time frame. We went for dinner (around 630pm) and spent about $40 including tip and one alcoholic beverage. The service was fast and correct. Our server was nice and friendly. The place was open enough that the couple with the very busy children were not a disruption at all. Dislikes: We were given a choice of where to sit and chose a booth rather than a table. The booth happened to be across from where people go outside to smoke. When they exited to smoke we were blasted with cold air and upon their return we were hit smoke-filled cold air. Next time we will just sit somewhere else. We will return :)
Lovely house with interesting artwork on display. Rotating exhibition is also of interest but the house itself is beautiful.

I'm not a ribs fan, but the ribs at this place are really good. Nice and lean, good flavour, good portions. Wings are fall-off-the-bone and really tasty as well, but not quite my style for wings. Skip the fries - they're not the stars of the show. We will go back, more likely for takeout than eating on site, but the service was very nice, helpful and cheerful.
On parle bien ici d'un fastfood, il serait temps de le juger comme tel. Un service la plupart du temps rapide, des équipiers souriants pour la plupart. McCafé, borne wifi gratuit en accès libre, beaucoup de place, quelques tables en extérieur. Bref, un bon McDonald's.
Expensive but good food...lots of crowd in weekends and can get very slow and patience testing sometimes
Salt Lake Express is a get option for last second rides or if you can't find anyone to go with. Their drivers are friendly and they do their best to keep everything on schedule. A solid business. I would recommend it.
The service may not be the greatest but the food is wonderful.

I have used Colgrove for my two breast augmentation surgeries and have been happy with both surgeries. One of saline implants leaked 6.5 years after the initial surgery. I went back and upgraded two months ago to silicone, I should have done that in the first place! I highly recommend silicone over saline. Not fun to go to bed with a nice, full breast and to wake with a flat one! Especially if you dont have 3-5 k in the bank to fix it. Thankfully mine were still under warranty but I did not want to risk having that experience again. Since I only have experience with Colgrove, I cannot compare him to other doctors in this field but he does have the best price in town. I agree with some comments about his lack of bedside manner, friendliness etc but I disagree with the comment that you "get what you pay for." He does great work from what I have seen and my personal experience. I really dont care as much about my doctor being nice as I do about him being excellent at what he does and in my opinion he is. His staff IS nice to include the nurses and his anesthesiologist which are the people you deal with most anyway.

I always have a good experience at the aquarium! I take my little sister, and she loves it. There's fun stuff for kids to do and she always learns a lot. For her birthday, my parents got her and I tickets to actually snorkel in the tank with the whale sharks (and hammerheads I might add). It was one of the coolest things I've every done-the swim right beneath you! The only down side is the price of tickets and food and merchandise when you're inside. If you can get past that, it's awesome!
Great place to stay for shopping. International Mall and Dolphin Mall within walking distance. Modern and clean hotel.

I have been coming to Cass St for years now, great place to get away from the tourists, couple blocks from the beach, and the beers are decently priced. The teryaki steak sandwich is bomb too, but they've never had fries. They have Burgers, chicken sands, and other sandwiches, but they have NO FRIES! They have these cube potato things that you would only order if you were at another restaurant and had ordered an omelet, and they happen to be out of hashed browns so you got stuck with the cubes with bad cheese melted on it. I need some crunchy onion rings or fries with my burger and beer, sorry. Who on this lovely earth do you know that doesn't love french fries? All you need is a frier, easiest thing to make at any restaurant. Anyways, the only other bad thing about this place is the way they store their pint glasses in the ice water germ infested little sink thing below the taps. The bartender handles all this cash and change in her hands, and sticks her dirty fingers in "the pint glass pool" only to pull the pints out with her fingers INSIDE the glass AND around the rim where my lips are about to go! I always have to wipe the rims because I am not about to put my lips on that, we all know how much an average bartender handles money and regular duties. My lips and mouth don't want anything to do with dirty money fingers. And I wouldn't have blown them up on here if they would have let me email them, but they do not have an email address. Still a fun place to hang out at and shoot pool with some beers, maybe I'll just order bottled beers from now on..
I eat here at least 15 times a month There's is an older Mexican woman who is typically at the salsa and cheese who apparently thinks that's her personal cheese. You ask for extra cheese, you barely get the median amount. You then ask for more, and she literally gives a two fingered pinch. The rest of the staff is courteous and pleasant. I'm baffled that this indifferent individual still worms here's

Stayed there for 2 nights during my last business trip to KL. Compared to my default hotel the "Shangri-La" it does not provide the same quality of service and accommodation. The furniture in my room (#2625) looked quite used. Room was of decent size. The restaurant served a good choice of different foods. But still a good choice if Shangri-La is fully booked;-)
Food was excellent and wait staff very friendly and energetic. Would remember the fish tacos.
My wife and I were driving up to 280 from Heardmont Park and decided that we really wanted some Daylight Donuts, as we don't get them often due to them being on the other side of town (we live in Hoover). I called them around 12:55, only to have one of the workers that was on duty tell me that they were about to close. I sighed and thanked her for the information, but before I hung up, she told me that if we hurried we could still get some before she closed. She stayed open for us (we finally got there at 1:08) and we were able to get our donut fix. I didn't get her name, but whoever was working on 5/19 at closing time was awesome!
Food is great. A Ethiopian restaurant and bar.

I love LA Fitness. I like the people (even the old people that just sit on the machines), and I love the way it is set up. The price is about the same as the other good gyms in the area, it just feels better. I never feel too close to people like I do at other gyms. However, the staff is terrible. Just awful. There is one good lady at the front who is nice, and a lady who teaches the spin class in the morning is good. Other than that, they have overweight and lazy trainers. On the weekends there is a lady who sits over in the side desk area and just makes personal calls while swearing, and being completely unprofessional.
I love the food here. Also, if you do get bad service, the managers usually take care of you by giving your meal to you free. You can't go wrong with O'Charleys.
Great Cali burritos with potato, rolled tacos and won't break the bank. Pollo asado marinated to perfection. Check it out!

The mall was great to visit and yes, I wound up buying a lot of items! It's worthwhile (to me) to try something on before buying it as opposed to just ordering clothing online. Finding a parking spot was easy due to the available space indicator lights above every space. On a side note, motorcycle parking fee is the same as automobiles. So if you ride there with one or more other motorcyclists, you'll have to each get a parking ticket even though you'll most likely be using a single parking spot. Went with my fiancee this past weekend and rode our motorcycles instead of driving the car. We picked a single ticket upon entering as we knew we'd both fit into a single parking space. Upon exiting, we were delayed almost 10 minutes at the exit gate by an attendant that stated we needed two tickets to exit. The exit gate would simply not accept my parking ticket. It displayed "unreadable" and I'm not sure if it was smart enough to sense two motorcycles or just couldn't read my ticket. A couple of calls to the main office by the attendant, resulted in the barrier arm being raised and we were allowed to leave at no cost. Great customer service for having been delayed/inconvenienced but a revised parking plan for motorcycles would be nice.
For what they are, they are good. And what they are is an over-worked, understaffed clinic; that services more personnel, than they were mean to. That having been said, they are professional and typically see me in a timely manner.
Delicious buttery crab.
A "different" resteraunt, Nando's is a very interesting place with exotic and flavorable food with a highly recommened chicken platter. Nando's has many options for their special "Peri-Peri" sauce, which include choices from very mild for the weak taste buds and Extra Hot for those who wish to take a trip on the hot side of life. Nando's has very attentive management and a friendly staff. I highly recommend it.
During the Utah 2013 Pride Festival ; my party and I of about 7 other social gatherings were approached by security about no glass, or no alcohol, on the premises. It wouldn't have been bad if they stated this rule out for the additional 7 other socials there. We were all there to have and enjoy ourselves. That family of 9 looked pretty suspicious, way to many smaller kids for two parents to watch. (way to single out our LGBT group out of all of them) recordings posted to my blog.
Loved my lox and bagel. Oatmeal was perfect, and the bacon egg English muffins also hit the spot. Don't think twice about going here.
味道很好，就老板一个人在厨房忙，上菜不是很快
We we introduced to Martin through a friend who had used him to 'fix' the issues caused by another designers poor work on their renovation. Based on this recommendation, we used Martin's services to design an extension to a 1940's fibro house. We wanted the design to look like it 'had always been there' and to maintain the original feel and features of the house. We are very happy that Martin's design managed to do both of these things while creating a modern, usable space for our family. The end result is exactly what I imagined from Martin's drawings. Martin was always available for consultations outside of 'office hours' and always professional. I am happy to recommend his service to our friends.
People have been telling me to check this place out for a while. Unfortunately, coming from Silver Spring just to check out the latest in Dupont seems like more trouble than it's worth sometimes, but I was in Dupont this morning for other reasons and remembered it for lunch. I ordered the chicken satay over cold noodles with the red curry, broccoli, papaya slaw, and peanuts. Needless to say, it was truly spicy, but I love spicy foods and found myself putting a touch of Sriracha sauce on anyways. The cold noodles really helped to balance out the tastes, and every ingredient tasted fresh and well-prepared. The amount of textures and tastes you can cram into a bowl for seven bucks makes this place pretty hard to beat. For those questioning the authenticity of the food, they make a point to say that their food is inspired by, not actually, southeast Asian. And, as someone coming from the Vietnamese and Thai food mecca of Silver Spring/Wheaton, I'd say this is a pretty great tribute to those cuisines. I'll be back many times when I'm in the area, for sure.

Great food, friendly service and a super menu. HIGHLY recommended! Enjoy!
Not only it has a great selection of belgian beers but also a cosy atmosphere inside as well as a great terrace with view on Manneken-Pis. Not to miss !
Love this place!! I also love taboons i have a hard time choosing between the two!

Great pizza for a great value. The last few times my service has been just above par, but I can't expect much more from an overworked group of college students. The food has been fantastic and a great experience overall.
The new sliders are excellent. Call in and pickup service is courteous and fast.
Had the salmon sandwich, the portion was a little small for the price but overall was very good. Nice little semi fancy restaurant.
I love this place

Good Place!!!
The food is a little overpriced, but tastes great. I have tried a lot of the restaurants in the quarter for some Gumbo, Jambalaya, and etouffee. I have ended up with a lot of disappointment. The food here tastes good and the service is fast. If you want a good meal meal of traditional New Orleans cuisine, this is definitely a good place.
Very friendly front desk staff. Rooms are large, always clean, and comfortable with free wifi. I've stayed here serval times and Christmas Tree Inn is always my first choice when I'm in the area.
Value for money.
Great atmosphere.
We eat here a often. The food is consistently good, with a nice variety.
Very nice atmosphere. Good to separate between smoking and no smoking areas in different floors. LOVE the fruit tarts :)
Punctual moving company, erudite employees. They were respectful, helpful and friendly. We haven't any problems with the transportation, no damages, no broken goods.
the decor could have been better p.s. i never went to this restaurant so i don't actually know
My family was in town for a funeral, and we stopped in due to its location and great reviews on yelp. We were a bit skeptical at first because it literally looks like a hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint, but we were pleasantly surprised once the food came. Great food, great service and the atmosphere wasn't bad. I would give this a 5 if it weren't from the outward appearance and lack of parking. The place was slammed but we got in and seated (8 of us) quickly. Some of the best Mexican I have had!
Good people, good food, but you will have one problem--picking between their amazing home made sauces!

Cozy little wine bar. Good experience.
The personal service is great, of course dealership is spendy fix, but i can swallow that for the service i get. the only thing that would really top it off if they did loaner cars for more then 4 hour fix or more (including you wait time) but the don't. Great guys, and they are even willing to share there work, Once i had something wrong with my car, the Mechanic that could fix that wasn't there that day, so they shared with me another place that was close by that could do the work just as good and quickly.. caring more about the customer and not the $ went a long way in my book. I was grateful for the info and things worked out great. Got the car fixed. Makes me want to go back again because i know they want to help me, not just take my money.

Great place for breakfast, lunch or dinner! You can't go wrong!
Nice place, indeed. The food is reallty good.
I currently live in Village on Post Oak. It's a cool place, the office staff is really nice, and Sandy is the best. The apartments are priced really well, the only draw back I have about them is they are surrounded by ghetto apartments. But all in all I really like living here, and I plan on staying here for a while.

Went here because my muffler had broken its welds after 10 years of my bad speed bump edicit. They took me in right away, and hooked me up with a new exaust system for a good price. Now good for another 10 years of my dukes of hazard driving.
No reservations. But this place was worth the wait. We went on Mother's day per my wife's recommendation. I had the queich. It was much better than the waffles. We may need to go back.
es muy pequeño... pero muy acogedor...me gusta......

This was one of those places that you stumble upon, but are grateful that you did. We were driving through Monck's Corner, looking for somewhere for lunch that wasn't the same old McDonald's or Burger King. This place looked like the antithesis of fast food, so we stopped. Boy, were we glad! We had some excellent collards and butter beans while there, as well as the usual southern comfort food. The head waitress (? owner?) was hysterical, as was the woman manning the grill in the back corner. They were more than friendly, spending time entertaining our kids throughout our meal. We were even able to get some great tips from them (such as to visit the wonderful Mepkin Abbey nearby). The next day we were talking to our waiter and the chef at lovely Hominy Grill in Charleston about our fun experiences in the Carolinas. They were both familiar with the Howard Restaurant and couldn't believe that we'd stumbled on it. All in all, well worth a stop to experience some of the Low Country hospitality.
Rocky's pizza is worth the dough. I have enjoyed their pizza for many years. I always get delivery and Rocky's special is my favorite. It would compare to others supreme. Their pizza is very unique. It's similar to Greggs pizza. They cut it in strips not pie slices.

These guys were great and were able to get me in quickly in an emergency. They were very kind and professional. I will be using them as my first call in the future.

One of the best examples of cheap Chinese takeout around. Make no mistake folks, if you don't like cheap Chinese takeout, you probably will not enjoy a meal from this establishment. If, on the other hand, you enjoy a nice bit of cheap Chinese takeout from time to time, this place will not disappoint!

Well laid out, clean store. Friendly staff. Rock solid beer selection, including local brews. Good selection of bombers. Fair pricing.
Taco Amigo is the bomb! I've been going there since high school and it is consistantly great! Everything is good there, I love the tostadas and bean burritos. Even the American food they have is yummy, the fries and cheeseburger are good, no better fry sauce anywhere. Go check it out if you haven't been!
I see a couple people had a bad experience, but I can't say the same. I was having a couple of issues with an old jeep and am very happy with the service from Absolute. They may not be the cheapest in town, but the quality work is worth it! I had a ton of questions about what was happening and the items on my quote so Larry walked me back in the shop where my car was being worked on and the mechanic (Jesse) walked me underneath and showed me everything he'd written up. I was satisfied, got the work done, and have been problem-free for a year. That's saying a lot for a 99 Michigan vehicle!
Good service, honest & price compatible.
Large portion sizes. Service was quite good. Food was tasty. No complaints at our table.
I come here every month.. mainly for the beautiful lake view. The fried calamari is awesome! Burgers and salads are average. I would recommend going elsewhere if you want a good quality steak. Servers and staff are friendly. Great atmosphere.
Food is always great. I even look for Panera when I travel. While I've never had a problem with the service, this is a fast food restaurant.
I recently stopped by here to check out their selection of craft beers. The store part had a decent collection of different brews from around the area and the country. I popped in to the restaurant and was a little disappointed with their selection of beers on tap. I didn't see any great micros but I ended up with a Killian's and can't complain. The chicken cheesesteak was very large and came with a pickle and chips at a very affordable place. I would definitely recommend this for a quick stop and grab in the middle of the day. Everyone was friendly and the Phillies game was on. Perfect.
Not the nicest looking place, but very good food for the price. Lunch specials are very good deals. I would recommend this place to friends.
Had a blast with family sampling a few different crab dishes and learning the best way to de-shell and eat steamed crabs! All-round fun experience.
Stayed here for 4 days on memorial day weekend. The place was still getting some renovation work done. The room was in excellent shape but was still outgassing some of the adhesives. A quick spray with some febreeze knocked that down. Would definitely stay again.
Great food served cafeteria style, fresh baked loaf's of bread, beautiful cakes and pies.

I have always liked this sushi bar. I had a nice selection of sushi rolls, sashimi and nigori tonight and everything was spot on. I've never been disappointed here. I worry that the last few times I've been here the restaurant has not been very crowded. Its a favorite place of mine
Pizza
Nice pizza, particularly the specialty pizzas. We picked up the pizza and accidentally dumped our two boxes on the ground and they insisted on giving us new ones. We appreciated that gesture a great deal.
Enjoyed my stay here and had a great xmas party there.

Ate there for the first time tonight, one of the best chicken fried steaks I have ever eaten and HUGE portions.
I go here on a regular basis. The staff is very friendly, we are even on a first name basis. I think that is very unusual in this day and age.The food is great and served up fresh each and every time. I especially like their homemade breakfasts, pizza and Latino food such as their burritos. I highly recommend Pizza Movers on Flower Ave.
This is my neighborhood liquor store. I've been coming here for 15 years, and the selection and service are excellent.
Looks old-fashioned, but the food is amazing! I HIGHLY recommend the scallops -- such a delicious preparation. Definitely a hidden gem - often overlooked because it looks old. They need to update their decor and exterior.
A very pleasant experience overall. We stayed there for one night; upon arrival quite early in the morning we were checked in quickly and courteously. The room was clean, comfortable and well appointed, though quite small. It is a short walk to the river from the hotel. Would definitely recommend to friends and stay there again.
I love Pontillo's pizza and it's usually in my top 3 choices to order from when eating at home. The problem seems to be a disconnect between the various locations as far as menu items, quality, hours of operation, coupons, etc. I thought the idea of a franchise was to uphold the same standards of quality at each location but this isn't the case anymore. I live near the W. Ridge Rd. location, which I would not recommend to anyone, yet go a few miles in either direction to Latta Rd or Spencerport Rd and you'll get a great pie. I've also emailed the home office twice about my problems at W.Ridge Rd and never a reply so just stay clear of that one. Otherwise, enjoy!

I usually just stop in for a Bahn Mi. They're good sized, cost about $3.85, and are ready very quickly. The owners are always very nice, and when I have dined in, the service was great
Me and my family have been going here for years, and LOVE It! If you dont want to spend a fortune to see some the the newest family films out then this is the place for you. The popcorn is still being popped fresh and smothered with REAL butter and is very affordable. We usually get there early, and bring a pizza from a local shop... and let the kids play with a ball or some fun outdoor sport till movie time. Gotta get there early to get one of the good spots! This is meant to be a family place so there are kids but that's what makes this cool... no 100% quiet and boring like the movie theater and since you control the volume you can turn it up or down depending on your own needs. Going there again tonight for the 1st time this season and look forward to several more. Go and enjoy!

Fun farmers market but really small. The Indian bread and sauces guy had some great stuff.
I agree the staff doesn't go after customers to help them but I like that. Nice to be able to walk into a store and when ready ask for help. Every time I have asked for help the staff has been knowledgeable and helpful giving me detailed answers. Prices are good to.
Africana Guest House and Restaurant is a neat and reasonably priced location for visitors to Obuasi, the Golden City in Ghana.
The atmosphere was great, some food was awesome (chicken flautas) and some was a bit less accomplished. Bit pricey for small portions but fitting for Sedona, but the true killer was the service. We had a huge wedding party of 25 and as it was split, one server did his job as well as the others partly and was great, unfortunately my server was absent, unhelpful, and a little rude. As a server I wanted to confront her but as this was a friends reception I let the $1.50 tip do the talking. It has great potential, I hope the owners look into it but I won't go back or suggest it.

Its a good place for a hobbyist, I have being to this place many times good collection and quality of fishes, and yes its slightly over priced but not much as compared to Koramangala but it was affordable. and they have different brands of medicines and fish feeds
Not a burger joint, first of all. Nor do they have draft beer. Also, it is not Katy-Trail friendly. Do not try to ride your bike to the cafe, it is a long ride uphill.
great omelettes, good waiters, hard working owners
Possibly the best kept secret of Georgetown! Food was some of the best authentic Mexican I've had. Don't let the outside of the building scare you away. It looks a bit creepy when you pull up to it, but top notch service and excellent food await you.

Excellent down home cooking. As a business traveler several clients recommended this as a must visit. Perfect combination of down home feel, reasonable price and excellent quality mixed with neighborhood friendly service. Even though the shrimp and grits had an unfamiliar flavor combination, I still returned the next night to eat there again. Top five to visit.

Excellent Service, Reliable and value for money. I really like the way all the staff are uniformed and well equipped for the job.
The smoothie was too icy, my mouth was about to freeze.
We found ourselves in a predicument where we needed to help a family memeber and it was going to require some investigations. We called a few companies last week as it needed to be done on Thanksgiving. This compnay was by far the cheapest. The others wanted an extra fee for the hliday and this company did not. We spoke to George who came up with a few ideas we had not even thought of, and they went to work for us. They got everything we had hoped and we were very happy with the service we received from them.

The atmosphere and space is what I would described as refined new Hollywood. The quality and taste of the food is some of the best I have had in a long time except the plates are very small which did not work well for a group of 6 women and it was quite pricey. We were still so hungry that we walked down the street and had a pizza. I would definitely go back but probably just on a date with hubby.
Wow, ik stond in 15 minuten weer op straat en was prima geknipt. Het is goedkoop en snel, wat mij betreft goed. Maar diegene die je knipt moet snel knippen wel in de vingers hebben natuurlijk.

We come here a lot and we love it. Classy, pricy, Italian food. Some dishes, such as the ravioli, won't fill you up. You really need to talk to people to know which dishes are the best or just try them yourself. I highly recommend the pork chops with the sliced potatoes, peppers, and onions. I usually wind up taking 1 of the 2 pork chops home. I would have given 5 stars, but there are some drawbacks. The waiters can be strange, and the background music skips sometimes and sounds funny lol. It gets busy during dinner time, 5 p.m. to closing. If your a passerby and are looking for a inexpensive meal, you should go to some of the other restaurants on Washington Ave. In my opinion, this is more of a place for locals. I've never been to the bar area, but it looks pretty good. If your looking for a taste of Nutley and Belleville's Italian food, this is the place to go.
Really nice steaks and the creamed potatoes are lovely. A little expensive but certainly worthwhile

They have a color coded system With percentages off But the item I wanted to buy Was color coded 50 percent off But they refuse to sell it Said it was a fixed price But no where on the ticket did it say fixed. Will not shop there anymore.

This school is Amazing. Once you get onto the floor all the excitement begins. The instructors are very helpful and patient. Kelly in dispense is awesome when it comes to formulating color and can help you if your stuck. I reviewed several schools before choosing which one to go to and I couldn't be happier with my choice. TA rocks! !
I really like Presti's in all regards. I highly recommend going there.
Nice atmosphere, good food and service
A jewelry store that helps me find something in my price range. I've recently purchased two items from Carreras, both for my lovely wife. Found a beautiful teardrop necklace that was very reasonably priced as a surprise anniversary gift (after we said no gifts!). For Christmas, since I'm not the best jewelery shopper I purchased a Gift Certificate on-line and used as a stocking stuffer. There are certificates available in a variety of price ranges and it was a very simple process. For those guys who always seem to buy the wrong jewelry, the gift certificate is a great way to go.
I called them to take advantage of the Cash for Clunkers $3500 trade in towards a lease. I needed something newer and that got better gas mileage. I got preapproved on their website and got a call from salesrep Jheni. She told me I could come in that night and get a car. She told me in advance she had another customer at the same time. I got there and sat for a while. FInally we discussed the car and I test drove it. She collected my info and I took delivery of the car. It was late at night, so I didn't get a walkthrough and I wasn't shown the features as I'm sure they show other new owners. I didn't mind as I wanted to get home and I'm sure the rest of the dealership did too. One thing I didn't like was the delivery of the car. At Roush Honda they have the car ready for you in a brightly lit garage and you get to look over the car and get shown the features. Hopefully Lindsay will get a garage place/space to do that. Other than that it was an ok experience. I would have given it 5 stars if the process would have gone faster. Especially since I was pre qualified, and knew exactly the car and color I wanted. The sales person Jheni was very nice the whole time. One other thing, I was a little put off listening to another salesperson try to close a sale. They started to put down another car maker and then the manager came over and did the same thing. Why put down another maker especially when that vehicle has gotten rave reviews in all the car mags and car websites I read. It just sounded desperate and I would have walked out just like the other people did.
Great pool tables, well maintained. Friendly but drunks are asked to leave. Good beer and cheap beer. Pool competition on Thursday about 7:00pm. I always have fun....
Close to home and at a great price. Personal trainers are awesome. They know what they're doing. It is a small location compare to others and did which there were classes held there as they advertise.
Excellent choice of fresh local food. Food is always very good with huge servings, beers change regularly with plenty of guest ales. Service is sometimes a little slow, but is always friendly.
Great service. Food was really good too!
We ordered to go, the Pizza was great, cashier was very friendly and won over my children by giving them quarters so they could play the bouncy ball pinball game in their store. All the kids are begging for this to be our Friday night out stop!

My husband made our reservations and I was initially concerned when I read some of the older reviews. Whatever the problems were in the past, THEY FIXED IT. The rooms are tasteful, and exceedingly clean, the staff is very friendly and helpful. Darling and Earl on the front desk deserve commendation for going above and beyond. Yes, it is still near a busy road, and yes the bathrooms are small (it is an older building), but if you want convenience, this is the spot. Easy off the interstate, close to the Metro, close to Old Town. A great value for the money.
Not a big hotel but very cozy, which I like. They also have tennis & squash courts and free of hotel guests to use, apart from swimming pool! We also spent a day at Johor Premium Outlets. Room was clean. Food was great - chicken otak otak - excellent! The business suite I stayed has 2 full bath rooms, 2 TVs, quite unexpected. And it is close to Singapore. Definitely will see if I can go there again in my next trip to Singapore. ;-))
Myself and my partner came here last week. And i have to say, the food is amazing! If you want a taste of some real Indian food, then pay zest a visit! And go for something amazing! Don't just get a chicken tika and chips. Select something from the innovative dishes, they really are amazing! We had the seafood platter to start, then i had the Tandoori chicken breast, and my partner had the home style korma. (We always share) and they were amazing! And the prices are fantastic as well! I'd pass on the pub food and go here personally!

BEST CHINESE FOOD.
Service was above average. The front desk clerk was nice and gave us a number for a dependable cab company. She was even nice on the phone when I called to say we were running behind and wouldn't make the 3:00 checkin. Room and bathroom were clean and modern. The next morning we enjoyed a great continental breakfast with a happy and helpful attendant. I would recommend this hotel to those visiting State College!

A great restaurant. Faithful customer of over 10 years. Best time to buy chicken is during lunch and dinner hours. Not a place to eat. You would eat the menu standing before they seat you on a table. I buy to carry out and enjoy it on the outside. Try it once, what do you have to lose. Best thing would be that you won't come back, but you'll like it.
This is a little hidden gem! Don't be fooled by it's common place appearance, there are treasures and great talent to be found in this little cave hidden amongst suburbia. We often don't realise what we have just around the corner... I will be back, again and again.

I had lived in 501 N. Henry st. for 1 year starting fall 2010. I was not very happy for two issues: 1. noise: I was facing south western direction where drunken college kids yelled at random direction on their way back to home on Langdon., 2. top floor disadvantage of cooling & heating during summer & winter. So I moved out, spent 1 year on langdon, and now came back to 501 N. Henry st, but this time, to the unit facing north eastern direction on the non-top floor and now am very happy because I no longer have those aforementioned issues. So if you make a wise choice, I believe 501 N. Henry might be a decent choice for housing for students (I am a grad. student). What I particularly like about the building is 1. It has huge a community room on the ground floor where you can study and etc.. 2. It is located on the campus. 3. If you are facing north eastern direction, it is pretty quiet. 4. It is generally well-maintained and the staffs are kind in general. The lesson I learned from the apartment hunting experience is that, you must make a sacrifice something unless you want to pay for premium which I can not afford as a student. For instance, the studio unit I am living in 501 N. Henry st. is, pretty small (only 275 sq ft.). Final verdict: If you want to stick near to the campus but do not want to bother with noise from college crowd, north eastern side of 501 N. Henry might be a good deal, assuming you do not mind limited living space. Hope this review helps you.
I would probably push it to 4.5 stars I guess. Hunan Yuan is exactly what I expect it to be each time I go. Which is good. The food is not exceptional....... but maybe I just miss MSG....lol The service is always friendly and fast however. That you can count on.

I'm not sure about all the bad reviews, but I change out my living room furniture every year and honestly it's the best deal in town. Lack's is a rip off! Keep any eye out for the holiday deals. I've even had them issue me credit to honor them.
Dr Dvorak in particular is an excellent dentist. Our family has been taken care of by her practice for some years now and we are quite happy.
Good service, just kinda small.

This location is big and has a fairly decent selection. The reason I'm writing this is the praise the management, however. I had a situation where I ordered two items on the website during the 50% off everything sale during Black Friday. I had them delivered to my apartment, but when the USPS tracker said it was delivered the following week, I had not received anything. The post office either lost or stole both packages. I contacted Express's customer service and all that they did was refund me the money, which did me no good because I still wanted the sale prices. I went in to this Express with my story and the manager didn't even let me finish; he told me that he would mark both items down to what I paid during the sale if I could find the items that I ordered. I found both items in the store and showed him my online order confirmation and the refund confirmation, and he marked them at 50% off! Great customer service if you ask me. I highly recommend going here.
Very nice,clean and comfortable. Staff was very friendly. They also welcomed our dog. Will stay here again when back in the area.

True business hotel but little bit of improvement this place has a lot of potencial as it is very centrally located +ve wifi availabilty but signal strength is weak in room. Bedding options where good -ve few hospitality stuff where missing like door mats an improvement will take this place a long way.

Overall it was good. On the backend there were a few problems with following through on making sure plastic was put down prior to unloading everything in the house. Caused a little delay in unloading but overall it was a good experience & would probably use them again. Their pricing was definitely better than the other companies we got quotes from & feel we got a fair deal for the money spent.

I've only ever had take out, so I've never seen the inside. I've had T. Jin a few times. I used to order from a different restaurant, but I will definitely order from here now on. Portion sizes are huge. The pieces of chicken are so big, you will have leftovers. We ordered Orange Chicken, kids sweet and sour, and kids lo mein. The lo mein filled up an entire take out box, worth the $4.95! I have had beef and broccoli, orange chicken, sesame chicken, kung pao chicken, and the lo mein. They are all delicious!!
The place was fairly full for a Tuesday night but the service was fast and the food was good. Love the atmosphere.
I was there on a busy long weekend. There was a queue out the door, but there's a friendly maitre'd who got everyone seated in pretty reasonable time. Kids are well catered for with colouring-in supplies, a playground out the back door, and a kids menu. There was also a particularly skilled face painter on hand that day. Food was excellent (decent portions, nicely presented and cooked well), as was the coffee (espresso & piccolo). The staff are great are talking you through the coffee taste profiles and choosing the best beans to take home. The table service was a little slow, but not bad considering it was rammed for Sunday lunch. The crowd was a great balance of hairy hipster, lycra-clad cyclists, young (hip) families and local council housing residents. Recommended.

My daughter and I enjoyed a really pleasant stay at this hotel. The room was comfortable, the breakfast delicious and the staff welcoming and friendly. I would recommend it without reservation. My only advice would be make sure you know where you are going. Armed with only a map it did take us quite a time to locate it!

Very Professional and Thorough. Tom and his crew did a fantastic job and were very approachable and friendly. Stacey made sure all the back end processes were taken care of. We did have a mis-measurement of one window (out of 14 installed), but that was taken care of at no charge. Overall very happy and would use them again.
Spinach and mushroom lasagne..wow
Rätt mycket prylar men biltema har även dom gått ifrån sin kärnverksamhet tyvärr.
I had Sales Specialist Joe Feiereisen, and he was with me through the whole process of buying my '03 Honda Civic. He was very approachable and didn't try to take advantage of my lack in car knowledge. When we test drove my car, he noticed a few things that hadn't been listed and added them to the pros/cons list - the biggest being all the corrosion on the engine and such - but he assured me that I could take the car to my mechanic and have them take a look. After my mechanic's suggestions, Joe and I negotiated a price; we both got the price we wanted from the car. He was an awesome salesman, and I would recommend him to friends and family.

Awesome so far. Far from the noises of the main roads. If you like a quiet place to stay with nice beds and nice Balinese themed rooms, Abian Biu doesn't disappoint.
I really like this place...the simple decor felt quite welcoming. I have to say Amirah, the skincare specialist gave me amazing tips and a great microdermalasion (i think it's mispelled) treatment that I'm considering having again Also, great SMS marketing..This is how I heard of biolote's offers
Unprotected, but not in too shady a place. Public enough.

Close to inlet. Far enough up the river that you're sheltered. Pretty well marked waterway. Lots of traffic at odd hours. The band up the river sucked, but was quickly drowned out by the live aboard crews. The old people in this marina party way past my bedtime, but at least they are having a good time. Staff was pretty friendly. The ramp is hard to use for large boats on windy days because their gas dock will pinch you off. Still wide enough to thread. The ramp itself though was pretty nice. The rest rooms were clean. I'd visit again.

There are so many headaches that arise when your washing machine leaks. I had this problem earlier this year. I couldn’t do any washing until the problem was fixed. I had 2 companies come out to give me a quote for the problem and I went with Swiss Plumbers whose price was considerably more competitive than the other company. Even though the cost was low, the work was done to an excellent standard.
Got an awesome tattoo done here yesterday. The artist, with my permission, even altered the design a bit, and I love it more than I thought I would. My brother got one as well and he gave us a (very small) discount, but managed to get both of ours done in less than an hour. The only thing I would say that bothered me was that he never introduced himself or chatted during the process...so I don`t even know his name to recommend him to anyone else! But he was very good. Would definitely go back next time I`m in the city.

Its so useful
Alta had a great selection of tapas. I ended up splitting plates of fried goat cheese in honey, brussel sprouts (surpringly delicious), and the lamb meat balls which had an egg yolk to dip in. We also split a plate of paella, which although was very tasty was different than any other I've had before, and didn't seem so authentic. It had like cous cous type grains in it and noodles, which seemed strange. I also had the chocolate molten cake, which was AMAZING. Just oozed with warm chocolate, which was complemented by a scoop of cold ice cream. Service was very quick and attentive. The sangria was also very flavorful, and you could definitely feel it. The ambiance of the place was very romantic with its dim lights and candles. The one suggestion I would have is to put a sign outside the place! I walked past it twice before I realized where it was.
What a pleasant suprise! I only stopped in for a brochure and drove off with a 2013 Edge. Alex B. was awesome, no pressure. Introduced himself, left me to check out the car and then asked if I had any questions, went for a test drive and I was sold. Now if all car dealers were like this they just might a loyal following of customers. I am a first time Ford owner, and I love the Edge, it's sassy! Thank you Alex. Irene Rochefort Westminster CA

Nice upgrade from old school CB. Went for first time in years with family and the place was very clean, food was great, salad bar was super, extremely nice waitress.. Perfect place for family dinner and they have some nice local pictures on the walls!!!!
Place was packed. Had to get it to go and ate it on the beach
My husband has been going to this office for years. My insurance changed, so upon my husbands recommendation I visited as well. I am very pleased with my experience. I opted for the newer, more expensive technology and did not have to have my eyes dilated, yeah! They were also very understanding of a parent bringing their children for the appointment and made accommodations for them: water for the coughing child and goodie bags while the children waited. I will be back next year!
Passing through and stopped for dinner. Wasn't in the mood for the traditional Mexican so went for the fajitas. They were fabulous! Ask for extra tortillas because it's a lot of fixens for 3 tortillas. Service was average.
The security staff is excellent. .

The pops are a good place for a family get together and very fun. The building is very beautiful and has great service. Overall great!
Mittlerweile gehört "Der Engel" zu unserem Lieblingsrestaurant. Das Essen, egal was ich bisher probiert habe, schmeckt wirklich lecker und die Portionen sind reichlich. Man sollte am besten reservieren, aber manchmal bekommt man auch noch ein Plätzchen ohne Reservierung, dann kann es allerdings etwas länger dauern, aber das nimmt man in Kauf wenn alles voll ist. Die Einrichtung ist halt "gut deutsch" ;) .... aber dennoch nicht schlecht, es passt. Es gibt auch einen Außenbereich, der auch bei kalter Witterung die Raucher nicht frieren lässt. Einen extra Raucherraum hat Der Engel auch. Der Service ist eigentlich sehr gut, manchmal, wenn es sehr voll ist, dauert alles ein wenig länger, das könnte noch verbessert werden. Aber gut, gutes Personal zu finden ist nicht so einfach. Alles in allem kann ich "Zum Engel" nur empfehlen. Bevor ich es vergesse, z.B. für die WM und EM Fußballspiele lohnt es sich erst recht hinzugehen .... die Übertragung wird per Beamer an die Wand geworfen und die Stimmung ist klasse.
Se come de poca madre ahí.
I love Dominos. I live close and like to pick up my food from the store. Get deal and very friendly staff
I like! Don't expect the Ritz, but it's a decent joint for casual food and burgers.
for the price it fails to please the palate.
Took my dog in for her yearly physical and shots. The care and the way they treat my dog is amazing. I recommend this vet to everyone.
Off the beaten path. Excellent pizza especially for the price.
Ambiance is very nice and cool. Service and Menu card is quite impressing.
Best buns on a burger and the flavors were great. The milkshakes were delish but a tad too expensive. The staff was friendly. I would definitely go back. Yum!
service & food was very good
Friendly waitress great food and coffee with real cream. I was not disappointed!
Great food and fast service. This was a pleasant surprise to find in a small town. Kobe was good enough to compete in a big city.

It's not a fancy place, but I love the food! This may sound very particular, but the mild sauce is amazing! This is my family's go-to place for pizza. Sometimes it's is a bit greasy, but I'm not going to say that's a negative. The only thing I've ever not liked, surprisingly given what I just wrote, is their chicken wing pizza. Perhaps it was just a one time thing, but I thought the chicken had the consistency of sawdust. The whole table agreed, and trust me, we are not a family that throws away chicken wing anything. Service has never been bad. Definitely try it if you're here, at least as take out.
lovely food. Prawn was great. I like it. :)
Whwat a great place to listen to live music. The band was amazing and it was my first time here. I heard the Green Mill has some great Chicago culture and Al Capone actually had ties ro the place. The drinks were and great they even have a nice size dance floor. You have to check it out.
The best part about Double J's is the Bar-b-Que Egg Rolls. This is the only place I've ever seen these and they are addictive. I've told all my friends about them and they have enjoyed them just as much as me. The wait staff is always pleasant. Depending upon the time of day the food may take awhile to get to you, but that's my only complaint. We eat there pretty regularly since our business is located nearby and my daughter thinks they have the best salads she has ever eaten. The Cobb Salad is her favorite.
Great place, lovely atmosphere .. and the live music on a summer's evening... highly recommended!

We had annoying problem at the office from a while. There was some kind of problem with the water pipes, not only that we couldn`t use the water because it was dirty, but we also had to listen the irritating sound that the pipes were creating. Thanks to these guys everything is under control now and we can continue working in peace!
Closer to a 4.5. than a 4. We have a great time each time we come. There may be a wait occasionally, but the food tastes good, we've never gotten sick, and they have a happy hour at the perfect time (5-6:30PM). They're also close to home, so when we are craving sushi, we always come here. Not as fancy as some of the bigger places, but the service is attentive, and they're more than okay with families (read:small children) coming in for dinner. We'll keep going here as long as they're open.

My favorite place.... I loved Chef when he was at Swoon in Hudson, and at AFITR they do what excites them and you'll love it too! Great feeling of community and a connection to local ingredients. Inventive dishes every bit as good as NYC, but healthier and a bit cheaper! Lots of Bard kids and families which is nice. Dinner menu changes a lot which is always a good sign even though you fall in love with a dish and then it's gone... Front of house is more casual and friendly than professional which I can live with. Dessert & coffee service always seems to fall apart, but the plates and entrees are the stars here. They've upgraded the short wine list with Rosenthal selections which is great, and are happy to let you taste beforehand. Children are welcome and the burgers and homemade sodas are excellent and healthy too! Must try the homemade mozzarella & awesome Hudson bread w/ salty chocolate Share, experiment, and expect to fight for the last forkful

My mother and I went in on a Saturday for mani/pedis. I called that morning and was able to get appointments for us both. Although they were busy when we arrived at our appointed time, we did not have to wait. We each got a great pedicure, my mom got a manicure and I got a full set of acrylic nails. The place was clean and comfortable. We were each offered a cold beverage and treated very well. The staff was very pleasant and communicated with each other and clients in English, rather than speaking to other people while working on your nails in a language you cannot understand (which is just rude.) My only complaint is that although my nails seemed well done, they turned out a bit thick and wide for my liking. I filed them a bit at home and reapplied a top coat and they looked great. Overall the staff and atmosphere is great and the prices are reasonable. Just be specific as to exactly how you want your nails shaped. All in all, I will return and I highly recommend this salon.

Aside from the soups which are very disappointing (lack of seasoning, flavors, & ingredients), the food is actually well prepared, fresh, and tasty. Try the tostones (plantains fried & crushed), which are really good, but pop a hole in the container, or the steam will take the crunch out of them.

Great food, just love their cubano, the food is just great and we love to go there. In the winter it can be a little chilly though, but that's because the building is old. I've never seen any screaming kids there though and I personally loved the quiet atmosphere. I liked their Chicken cordon bleu balls, they were tasty and I loved the horseradish sauce which had a kick to it. I would recommend this place to anyone!

We just held my daughter's wedding at the Palace. The hall was beautiful, facilities were fine and food was very very good. The service was a bit iffy though from the time of booking. Support before the event was lacking and serving staff on the day were cranky. But all in all, the wedding was a huge success and we'll have good memories of the day.
Friendly farm shop with great fruit and veg

This is a reasonably-priced laundromat with a good deal of capacity. We were in and out in about an hour and the man that runs the place was very helpful in getting us going. There are also English instructions posted if he's not around.

Stopped in for a quick business lunch. Service was efficient and courteous, ordered the Angus cheeseburger and fries. Burger was cooked as I ordered it (medium rare), fries were obviously fresh cut (not frozen from a bag) and I was very pleased. So many places promise good burgers and FAIL, but Tommy's served up a nice fresh upscale burger at a fair price. I'll start bringing more customers there.
Tastes amazing, priced high.
Excellent live music. Frito pie and beer!

Naruto is a Japanese-owned restaurant serving ramen and sushi rolls. The house miso ramen was perfectly peppery and umami goodness. Just in biz one year this is the place to take in ramen as it is meant to be. I second the earlier review for good value. Cheers.
129 baht for the daily lunch buffet. Good choices
Blue Island is excellent - we gather our friends and family together for most birthdays and celebrations there, including the night before we got married, and my upcoming 40th. The decor is basic, and facilities rustic but acceptable - I'd been walking past it for years before even considering going in, because it is on a main route between bigger and brasher places, and looks so simple - but we have never been disappointed by the food or service, which is always excellent. The owner in particular makes you feel very welcome, and knew our names by the second visit. We recommend the meze - it's reasonably priced, and each dish that gets brought to you is of a really high standard... there's a chicken dish that usually comes out near the end that is OH MY GOD so tender and tasty that it's making me feel hungry just writing about it. WARNING: Try not to fill up on pitta bread and dips before the food comes out. It's a schoolboy error, and one that we make every time. Most restaurants do that on purpose, but you really do get a lot of food for your money here, and you won't want to leave any. We always get any leftovers wrapped up and take them home.

Halema's restaret
This library is in a great location near frequent buses and Dinkytown bars and restaurants. There are many kid features, though it doesn't seem overrun with teenagers and small kids. It has many computers available too. It doesn't have a wifi area for people with laptops with fried batteries, i.e., there's no place to plug in and surf except one outlet in a lounge area, and that, for some of us, is a real sinker.
Ask for, "Garlic-Butter and Parmesan-Cheese around the crust of your pizza for only $.50 cents more any size", Just Do it. Delicious
I'm not sure why some people are posting bad reviews. We love this store. We used to go to another game stop, but we will go to this one first. Josh is very customer service oriented. We love GameStop since it has a great exchange policy when you purchase used games. We also love their "insurance" on used systems. We got a another refurbished DS for the little bit we spent to get the extra protection. It was WELL WORTH the money. There isn't another sell and resale video store that takes care of you like this company does.

May's Thai Kitchen is my favorite Thai Food Restaurant to date!The food is excellent and a very good value! There also have vegan friendly dishes on the menu and everything tastes fresh! Anything can be made spicy and my husband and I love it that way! Great little family owned restaurant and May herself is lovely. My favorite dishes are: All the curries, pad thai, pad la na chicken, black pepper and garlic beef, pad pri king, pineapple fried rice, and the soups are delish! Whenever I go out of town, May's is the first place I go to when I come back! And she does catering! Can't say enough about the place. Lol. I highly recommend May's Thai Kitchen.
Great food just wish they would decide to move into a bigger space. Seems like we have to order out anymore as the wait for dine in is always large.
Good Chili's
I had a positive experience here. I took my vehicle here for a VA state inspection and the mechanic and the woman in the office that I dealt with were both kind and polite and my bill ended up being smaller than I expected. I will do business here again.

Terry Mykins did an excellent job as salesman. Even though I took a month to complete my decision and looked at many dealers and vehicles, I settled on a truck Terry showed me. He left occasional follow up messages but wasn't annoying. When I arrived to negotiate the sale, he was helpful and direct. He has followed up after the sale, too. Overall super job. The bad experience was with the business manager, Joe. He arranged financing which was great. However, he would only show monthly payments tied to extended warranty programs. I had to force him to show me the true monthly payment. His programs ranged from an extra $25 to $100/ month. He justified extended warranties on the amount of electronic systems in the truck, how some would fail, in turn causing others to fail and their costly service rates. So, I should buy an extended warranty because of the unreliable electronics, poor design and high price of their service? He's now raised doubts of whether I've made a wise choice in buying a Ram 1500. I didn't do any of the extended warranty programs. They detailed the truck and it looks really good. I've only driven about 200 miles but it runs great and I'm getting good mileage, as good as advertised, even with the AC on. I'm pleased with the truck and my relationship with Terry. I recommend Terry to anyone looking to buy a truck.
Splendid service. Also have road bikes.
Coolest hotel I've been to ! Decoration is very trendy, but services and facilities aren't neglected
This is the old standby. When it is late this is always a cozy spot to nip into for a pint and a bite to eat. It's bar food, but it's a good Pacific Northwest rendition of bar food.

Dépaysement garanti. Calme quiétude et personnel au petit soin. A consommer sans modération .
Just went to this place for the first time today. A Sunday at 11:30, the place was busy. I waited about 10 minutes for a table, which was less than I expected. The foyer has great family diner appeal, being papered with dozens of colored "Egg and Us" coloring book pages which had been colored in by kids. There were a lot of families with young kids there, but the crayons in a mug on every table kept them occupied and quiet. There was a great atmosphere in the place. Waitstaff was friendly and prompt. Our food took a while to arrive, but not overly long for how busy it was. I ordered the "Migas" scramble, which was quite tasty. The hash browns served with it tasted much better than they looked. The portion was generous and I was able to make a second meal of it later. Throughout the meal we were attended to frequently and courteously. The waitresses were really nice and I was never for want of anything. My only complaints are that my food was warm, but not hot. I think it was sitting for a while before it came to the table, but it was very edible and I liked it a lot despite that. Also, the glass my mimosa came in was dirty, and the drink itself was pretty pricey. My husband ordered a non-alchoholic drink, but still the cost of our drinks combined made up almost 1/3 of our total bill...yikes! They did offer free refills on the Arnold Palmer, but it seemed watered down. Overall, I had a pleasant experience there and will go again to try some of their sweet breakfast foods like pancakes or waffles. I'll stick to water though, as it's not the most budget friendly place. Definitely a great alternative to Denny's or IHOP for this style of food. Grade: B+ would recommend to people who enjoy breakfast foods in a casual setting.
I flew in from Norfolk International airport to Tampa for holiday leave (I just got back from deployment) and I wanted to take my family out to lunch. The steak I had and the blooming onion we all shared was great. As was the server. I'll be back again after the holidays.
A very, very good local. Excellent beers, friendly and welcoming staff, good quality food. No loud music. Somewhere to relax and unwind.
To be honest, we only use the place for takeaways but it really is excellent. Although the portions aren't exactly generous some of the time, the delivery service is super-fast and the quality of the food is excellent. We used to order from them more often than we do now, because it has become an expensive treat rather than a handy alternative to home cooking. If you are in Bridlington and you want an Indian meal, you will not find better in these parts.
Quick service and very helpful. My window made a whislte after the initial install but they came out again to fix immediately and it's been fine since!
Great Green Curry! But the decor can be better.
The food was good but a bit expensive. The quality of the tea was excellent. I was disappointed by the tea selection (smaller than expected) and the manner of servive (styrofoam cups). I was hoping for a chill teahouse with ceramic dishes and a more relaxed atmosphere. Charleston Tea Company is more of a coffee-shop style place that happens to serve tea. It's location across from the vistors center means there is a lot of traffic inside and out, giving the place a rushed feel. Again, good quality, but not what I expected.

Excellent pizza and French dip ....
By far my favorite Chinese restaurant in Kent. My family has eaten here quite a bit for the occasional family dinner and it always tastes the best.
Still a little on the busy side, especially at lunch time during the week, but well worth a visit. The food is certainly better than average and the beer & wine selection is great. All-in all it is a fun and relaxed place to grab a bite and a beer, assuming that is what you are looking for.

Probably best Barbour in town, friendly staff and environment. First time earlier today, Jeff was very helpful, it wasn't too busy, and it was pretty run of the mill at $16 not including tip. Only 4 stars cause they don't take debit/credit. Cash or check only, but there's an ATM right next door which I was able to run to real quick.

The rooms are very good but have no view to die for. The room rates are very competitive. The restaurant has a wide variety so you cannot fail to satisfy your taste buds, even for the picky ones. The staff are friendly and helpful, always looking for new ways to be of assistance. An adjacent golf course makes a whole world of difference and even without a personal kit one can still rent equipment and balls at a modest fee. It is the first hotel in the 16 I stayed at in 2012 where internet vouchers are given on demand free of charge. I cannot forget to talk about the shuttle to town, as a free service to the guests, which I used once in the two week period of my stay. You can take shuttle, do some shopping and other activities in town and take a shuttle back.

Tried the Hot Dog Challenge. Ultimately I like Lafayette food better, but the service and food at American Coney was good and left nothing to be desired.
They dont tell you what your services will cost .. please ask them very clearly or you will be left with an empty pocket .. I committed the big mistake of not asking .. The whole thing cost me a whooping $570 .. I was shocked but my mistake not to ask .. If the owner is watching this .. can you please make sure that you make it clear about your services before you give them .. and can you also tell how much a general 30k service costs and is there any way to avoid spending so much money .. I would have clearly refused the service if I was informed about this .. Finally I went to back and sorted this out with the Manager .. The Manager Mark Foster is very very helpful and he made sure that the Mistake in my service is corrected , I have 55 k of free Toyota care and I was charged by the mistake of an employee .. I got refunded for more and also got a free service .. I am very happy and would go back for further service .. Also I will give these guys a good review at qualcomm classifieds ..
As busy as this office gets I am surprised at how efficiently it operates. Everything went very smoothly and the staff and doctor were quite friendly and attentive.
Dommage que l'on ne puisse pas noté la cuisine qui est délicieuse! Savoureuse, raffinée et pourtant en bonne quantité : on est sorti la peau du ventre bien tendu pour une 50taine d'euros, le personnel était très agréable, repas d'anniversaire plus que réussi!

I expected the price to be lower, but am still glad that I found what I was looking for. Some reviewers write that the same part can be found at autozone or advance autoparts, which can be true for certain parts. In my case I couldn't find it (a steering knuckle for a 98 2wd Tahoe) in the stores. Would definitely buy from them again.

On a layover I found this ace through Google maps. It was hop fest and I got two flights of beer. The bartenders were very knowledgeable and thee was plenty of room at the bar. It was a friendly place and I enjoyed my Reuben, although I'd probably get the Cuban next trip. It looked incredible. My only critique is that I'd like a pint of Bert next time instead of a flight. I'll be back.

Super selection of fresh and ingenious indigenous food....
I bought my last car, a used Honda Civic Hybrid, at Right Honda Aug/2011 due in part to their amazing Service Dept. Now I just purchased the new 2013 Honda Civic love these cars!! I even had the same salesman I had 17months ago who is now one of their sales mgrs which made me feel better, it says something about their company. I have had the occasional check in call which for me is okay to see where I am at. Being a single woman walking into any car dealership can be very intimidating, but I did not feel the pressure to do anything I wasn't ready for, I came prepared with facts & figures, asked questions, made phones when needed and although it can be a lengthy process in the end it was worth it. I am happy with my new car and would recommend Right Honda to anyone & don't forget their amazing Service Dept!!
Went in to swap that data from the hard drive of an old computer to my new one. It was the best deal in Provo that I could find with a little bit of searching. The data was transferred perfectly, everything made it to my new computer, still organized. The service was friendly and informative. The only downside was that they had made a minor mistake that they realized when I came to pick it up, so it wasnt done until the next day. Not a big deal though.

Takes a while to get served, however it has just gone under renovation; this has improved the cinema greatly. As an unlimited customer, I often go to the cinema, and the range of films here is limited compared to the big Cineworld's such as Stevenage and Enfield, however the atmosphere is great and its great for going out to catch up with mates. Furthermore, one downfall is when renovating the cinema the screen seating capacity was reduced, to allow a staggered affect so you can see over the peoples heads in front of you, so sometimes new films that are popular will be booked out very quickly, and as an unlimited customer I can't book a seat unless going into the cinema before hand.
My wife and I sit at the bar more often than not when we go out to nice places. Maybe we should stop that because I think we were in agreement that the past Friday night we experienced literally the worst bartender ever. She had no idea what wine they had, what was dry, what a Malbec was, ect. We ordered steaks (which she also knew nothing about) and both were miss-cooked yet she never checked back after another server brought them out. I had to flag down another server as she stayed at the other end of the bar and acted like we weren't there. This was early on a Friday, 5:30 so the place was not busy at all. When the steaks came back, she delivered them and acted as if it were our fault they were poorly cooked. To top it off, I watched her repeatedly miss-pour beer after beer and then hand them to customers with foam running down the sides. It was comical and we came to the conclusion she must have been incredibly high on life or something else. The entire experience was ruined by the worst bartender of all time and is unacceptable from a low end restaurant, let alone someone trying to be a high-end steakhouse... Bad hire!
Try any of the beers on offer from this small but prolific brewery. 'Bluesbreaker' comes highly recommended - as Tina Turner screeched out years back "Simply the best"!!! All I can say is recommended. Get in touch, as he not only sells to pubs all over the North West (by the Barrel), he also offers his very tasty brews in smaller 10L bags for home consumption and is a very friendly, easy going chap to buy from. He also caters for parties and goes the extra yard to help you out, I heard he even went down a mine to cater for a party of pot-holers - haha proper nuts!

This place has some nice steaks and other meat entrees; but the service was only so so definitely not what one would expect from a place that is so expensive. I guess it is normal as it's location is on Lincoln but still I was expecting a bit more, the drinks took forever to come out and the server was not very attentive. The only thing that made up for it was that the steak was good.
This being my first and only visit to this establishment... I really enjoyed the food it was excellent!! The only complaint that I have, is with the service.. The girl that started off the line asks me what I'm going to have, I tell her and, then she proceeds to walk over to help another girl who is working on the line just about 2-3 feet from her and helps her with something she was doing.. When she returns back to her spot in the line, she then begins to ask me for a second time what I would like to have that day... I tell her again, and by now my impatient taste buds are beckoning for substance... She starts to assemble my burrito but, while she is doing this she proceeds to start up a conversation with the girl next to her in the line( the same girl she had previously helped)... and, too my utter surprise this girl once again looks up at me and asks me for a third time, what I wanted before she completed the tortilla, brown rice, steak, and, wow, a scoop of beans!! The broad couldn't multitask at all, nor did she have the short term memory of a small rodent!! Sorry, but for a first time visit, with having not a single table available for me and my family to seat and eat our lunch at, and that is after a 10-15 minute wait standing in line, to have some young thing who obviously should have been a moved from her place in line to a more productive placement in the line for her would have been working that cash register!! Someone dropped the ball in Management!! I will return here to eat again because the food was amazing, I just will not be visiting this location!!
Nice casual pub with good food and service
Every once in a while I order Chinese food, But I always order it from Hunan Palace. I can always count on their delicious food. It tastes fresh and It's always my first option when craving Chinese.
Its a good place to be. Very close to Greenville and its close to everything you need to live. Grocery stores etc

I love Woody's Drive-In. Fantastic food at fantastic prices. I go in at least once a week. it's just one of those places. Great value, friendly service. I gave it a "poor-fair" rating on decor because the place is old, rickety, and not very well maintained. But you know... I'm pretty sure that keeps their prices low, and that's fine by me!
This is the best Pick N Save in the area. They have high volume so the produce is better than at most - I won't buy produce at either New Berlin locations and the Waukesha West location is not as good either. The one on Bluemound is OK too. Good selection on other items, although some of the better things are being replaced by Roundy's brads. I agree with the service issues on other reviews, but I don't shop for the experience. I have tended more and more to go to Sendik's as the produce is even better and I can shop in much less time.

Very good place for work/office. Very quiet and subdued with ample parking space. Some premium food shops in the area - Starbucks and such. Could do with some low to mid level food shops for the budget conscious work bee. The function area is also good, I hear. Pricey though.
Good place to make money & enhance your English They accept undergrads
I was pleasantly surprised and how much I liked John's City Diner! I knew that I would enjoy them because their restaurant catered lunch to my employer and I decided that I would go to check out some other things on their menu. Their Chicken and Waffles is amazing and could put Gladys Knight's to shame. Very friendly staff, relaxed restaurant, great food... a gem that Birmingham has to offer!

Been going to Paul's now since 2000 and have never had a bad experience with its employees. However, having worked retail since that same year, I can tell you that there are those customers who are asking for help as soon as they come through the door. Their time is too valuable to waste it looking for something, so they want to be escorted around the store like royalty. I've even had customers call me on the phone with a list of stuff they wanted put in a shopping cart so they could wheel it to the cashier when they arrive. I find these negative reviews over-the-top and embellished by spoiled brats. If you don't like Paul's go to Wal-Mart and shop with the other clones.

I am very pleased with my care. They are efficient and detailed at Wynn Dental Care. I have been there for two years and have had three procedures, a few cleaning and check ups. They always give a courtesy call prior to appointments. The clinic is state of the art for sure. The staff and doctors are pleasant and considerate. Thanks Wynn dental.
We just bought a Honda Crosstour from Scott Clark Honda and we were delighted with the buying experience!

The food is excellent as well as the decor. My only complaint is the service. You could be the only one in there and they dont bring your drinks out as you sit down, they instead disappear. I had to stand and flag someone down because i wanted my drink with my salad. Thats my biggest complaint.
This Spec's does exist. We go all the time as well. It's in the back strip behind the gas station and the Berry Hill. They have a decent beer select, decent scotch selection, decent everything selection... Ok cigar selection, better than a convenience store by a mile but not as good as the HWY 6 & Bissonnett store and nothing like downtown Spec's, which goes without saying. That said, for a neighborhood liquor store it gets an A++ and the price is good too. Also Whole Foods is awesome. Just understand why you're there, don't go as a tourist. If you're anti-intellectual, anti-science, or just a negative person you won't have a good time. They have some of the best food you can get in a grocery store, a great bulk isle and the meat counter is pure heaven. Fish also, you can get sashimi grade fish... Try and do that at a Randalls or a Kroger and you'll probably wind up in a hospital...
Sweetwaters were fantastic. Smothered burrito had a green chili sauce which was perfectly spicy without being over the top. Burger done right. Great service with friendly staff.
Pretty clean. Nice staff. Concession stand is awfully expensive!! They should really stop ppl from talking loudly & using cell phones during the movie.
"We were looking for a great place for dinner outside of our resort, we found Jellyfish." The Food- I had the Red Snapper (Alex Style) - it was the best fish that I had in the Dominican (better than my resort). I also enjoyed a great tasting rice dish... just can't recall it's name. The Decor- Probably the best thing about the restaurant is the decor. Simply stated BEAUTIFUL. It looks exactly like the pictures on the website. The Service- The waiter, Manuel, was courteous, made great recommendations, answered our questions about the restaurant, and showed us pictures of events held at the Jellyfish. Honorable Mention- After dinner we walked outside to admire the exterior decor and the beach. We decided to take pictures but we were struggling to take our own photos. Manuel noticed our dilemma and came out to help us. Overall, we really enjoyed Jellyfish, it was the "Food" highlight of our vacation.
Ottimo! Locale bellissimo e cucina ottima. Unica pecca: appena arrivato al ristorante (con regolare prenotazione) mi è stato detto che il mio cofanetto SmartBox non era attivo, quindi non avrei potuto mangiare. Alla fine ho mangiato lo stesso e pagando 90€ in due....un altro ristorante ha accettato lo SmartBox senza problemi............ Avrei preferito una scusa diversa. Per il resto fantastico.

English speaking servers. Great food. I'd definitely go again.
I read all of the bad reviews on here but they were the only store in town that carried a designer that I was looking for so I tried them anyways. I had a VERY positive experience, the girls helping me were all very helpful and sweet. I found my dress here and I got a GREAT deal on it. I highly recommend Suburban Bridals, it took 3 different trips to Suburban for me to make my decision and I had a positive experience every time.
It's a good place to land, no contact about it. Security is tight, the staff is friendly. Prices for souvenirs a bit steep, but affordable.
Good on the first run through. Will try many more times and hope they keep it up.
I like this park. It is bigger than it looks, it has tons of stuff to do, like a dog park, a play area, gazebos, a garden, a pier, a small pond, lots of trees and more. It is clean and shady.

I love their chicken. The BBQ bacon sandwich it's a amazing. Sides are pretty simple and I'd personally say the Cajun fries are a bit too seasoned, but who cares when the chicken is so dang good! The only complaint I have is that they mess up the BBQ bacon sandwich sometimes; come on guys, your chicken breast is amazing, but when a guy orders something that's supposed to have dark meat too, don't leave it off!!

Mariusz was professional, prepared, and attentive during my photo shoot. He has a great sense of lighting and alignment to create balanced shots and took the time to prepare settings that would create the specific mood we were after, especially with client shots. The photos have definitely enhanced my website and marketing materials!
Great venue in the heart of downtown Vancouver! One of the more popular rooms left in the city to see both Live music and DJ based acts. The sound and lighting is fantastic. The room has great sight lines, staff is very friendly and there is always a nice mixture of events and music happening on a consistant basis.
Angelo's has been a favourite of our family for many years. Because it is a "Mom & Pop" restaurant, you don't get "franchise" food, you get delicious, home-made food. Prices are competitive, service is great (both eat-in and take-out). No one makes a better cheesecake! If you don't have room for cheesecake after eating the generous portions of the main course, take one home for later.
It was fine.
My first night club experience... i loved how the hosts asked what country in the world their patrons were from. fun. decent decor- dirty hollywood with a global dance crowd.
Never been to this Value Village but I have been to many and they have 1 thing in common. They have someone elses lightly used things for cheep. Everyone can afford to buy that extra sweater or jacket that ekeps them warm when they would other wise be cold. Buy that suit/dress that gets you the new job, you still have enough $$ for a can of beans and loaf of bread. Good thing you didn't spend that to pollute our air driving from store to store to find that awesome sale that is out of your size anyways and no rainchecks...LOL nokidding. Remember you can't find that shirt you loved or pair of jeans that is no longer being made at Walmart or Bootlegger. So if you don't want to shop there don't but keep your opinion to your self if you don't shop there because you think your to good for second hand. And I hope every1 keeps donating their clean and gently used items. remember its not a dump. they can only work with what they havebeen donated so don't expect to only see the most $$ brand names they have some from each and every price range.
good food/great price
Great place to buy good value ingredients for Japanese, Korean and Chinese cooking. It's worth a stop just to browse the shelves and to look over the fabulous fish counter with live crabs and other fresh shellfish. Highly recommended for a visit.
Excelentes ensaladas
Lovely walk to the place, placed among a consignment area which makes the night cool november walk with your loved one worthwile. Well, cannot comment on the show yet since it has not yet begun. Show timings 7 - 7:30 and 8 - 8:30.
I like the Salt Lake Express shuttle service because it has made it easy for me to get from Utah to Idaho without any problems. They have been very helpful and accommodating when I had missed a shuttle time. I recommend using their shuttle services.
This has got to be my Favorite Costco in the area. All of the staff is great and helpful even when the lines are long. I visit almost weekly. They recently have done some remodeling inside so now they have two walk in refrigerators (produce and dairy). The only down side like every other Costco is that it is usually crowded (anyone who shops at Costco knows this and that means that you know that your gonna be dealing with rude and aggressive shoppers). I can usually find what I am looking for and the staff has taken suggestions on items I have found at other locations.

Had the surf n turf last night - Halibut with a striploin. Although the portion was somewhat small the presentation and taste was exceptional.
This is not a luxury hotel and I did not expect it for the price. But unlike some of the horror stories I have read in the reviews it was more than adequate. The room was comfortable, clean and relative quiet for its location. Check in was quick, efficient, and the staff friendly. I did not partake in the continental breakfast as I left early in the morning but my overall impression is that I would not hesitate to stay their again for their bargain price and location.

My friends and I went to Thrillvania Thrill Park last Saturday. It was a blast we were a bunch of scared girls screaming at every little thing. They have these characters roaming all over the park it is so creepy and scary. The clown 3D house was so scary one of my friends is afraid of clowns I thought she was going to make me fall she was so close to me hiding her face in my back. The Manor was so creepy, ghouls and wolves were everywhere. I love the house on the hill the most. It was complete darkness with a tiny glow stick which of coarse we lost. Creatures would move by you and the earth was moving beneath my feet. It was crazy cool!!! We spent the entire night out there is was a night to remember. Thanks Thrillvania for showing us girls a great time!!!
Dr. Craig worked wonders on my neck, back and jaw within months of starting a treatment plan. Since a bad experience in college, I've always been suspicious of chiropractors of being out to take my money for unnecessarily frequent office visits. I was an as-needed patient converted to a regular care plan, and it's been worth the investment. I felt like Dr. Craig spent extra time and care making sure that I was correctly aligned and he addressed all my concerns. I'm also a severe TMJ patient who had relapsed into painful jaw-popping, and the issue has subsided to the point where I rarely think about it. Their front desk staff is terrific. Unfortunately Dr. Craig had heart trouble and doesn't work there anymore, but the other Drs. offer good care at a fairly reasonable price if you don't have insurance coverage like me.
I originally purchased my 2011 GTI from Douglas and I've been back there ever since for service. My service consultant, Rick Szucs has always gone the extra mile and taken time to go over any questions and make sure any work performed was top notch. I looked around before I decided to get my car and people like Rick is why this is the only place I'll take my VW to now.

Werner treated me great on a new car purchase 3 years ago, and the service department has always been excellent. However, when I went to trade that car in for a new CX-9 a few weeks ago they totally ripped me off on the value of my trade-ins. I'll be taking the new car somewhere else for service.

Every time I finish a meal here, I think, "I wish these people would give classes." The eggplant is treated perfectly in every dish. The house-blended (hate the abused word "a*******l") spices and condiments pique but never overwhelm. The menu is tight around the Fertile Crescent, but that's all good. Traditionally done weekend lunch there, and have now upped it to the dinner choice, as well. A quiet treasure.
As caves go it is not the best or the worst I have been in. Still it was interesting and we had a good time. If you go bring a jacket (it is 53 degrees down there), be prepared for a walk down and up a hill and a set of stairs, and sitting for the 45 minute tour on a very hard seat.

Good food, not the best Jamaican food I've had but good. I would advise anyone to go. Only bad thing about the restaurant is the service
I recently leased a car with you guys last August, and my car had a minor leak in it. It was the oil filter, and they were able to fix it at no cost for me and fast, which I thanked them immensely for, but the process to drop my car off on a weekend was horrible. I have never experienced where a service area was only half staffed on the weekends, and where I was told that I would need to "make other arrangements" to drop my car off during the week. Not only was he sarcastic with telling me this, but it was just really frustrating. I was really aggravated by this, and its unfortunate because I know of 2 people in my family that are looking for cars, and I will advise them to not go to Chevy because of this situation. I love my car, but this situation really had a negative impact on me.

The meal I ordered was accidentally given to the table next to me. They apologized and very quickly made another dish for me. They even gave me 50% off of my meal because of it. The waitress was very friendly and helpful. The manager came to me twice to make sure that I enjoyed my meal and also apologized for the mishap. It was obvious that they work very hard to make sure customers are happy. I'm not big on restaurant food chains, but I have to say that this was probably the best service I've had anywhere in quite some time. I was very impressed.
Lots of action in this attractive restaurant. You really want the food and service to be great but it never is. Pleasant but never great food, the special wine was bitter, the sauce a little spicy , the waiters nothing special but it looks good.

L'hotel e' posizionato in una zona molto tranquilla, non vi sono rumori assordanti dalla strada,non vi e' confusione interna, le pareti assorbono molto il rumore provenente dalle altre stanze. A soli 100 metri dalla metro "glouster road". Le camere sono confortevoli e pulite ed il personale accogliente e gentile. Vi segnalo che nelle immediate vicinanze troverete un hypermarket "tesco" aperto 24 su 24.

Don't let the decor turn you away. The food was absolutely delicious, everything was fresh. The bread was lightly oiled and served with dipping oil. The tortellini soup was served in a broth that could stand on it's own for texture and flavor, the spinach and egg in the soup was a perfect blend. The house salad was fresh, chopped perfectly and the house dressing was delicious. The entrees were perfect. We both decided on seafood pastas, different pasta, sauces spiced differently. Both were excellent. I can't wait to go back.

I had never heard of Rice & Beans, but the name of the restaurant leaves no mystery to what they offer. A friend of mine suggested the place, he spoke so highly of the place, what I initially assumed was embellishment I would later discover was genuine candor. Upon entering Rice & Beans, we were not only greeted with a warm smile from all the employees in proximity but also by the aroma of authentic Latin food, at least affordable Latin food on a college budget. I ordered the lunch special, for about 6$, I got a generous helping of mixed rice and beans (from a choice of three types), a few fried plantains that were perfectly sweet and savory with a soft inside and a slight crisp on the outside, stewed beef with potatoes, and a side of black beans. They also had grilled chicken, pork stew, and chicken stew. My friends got the grill chicken and all of our meat selections were cooked exceptionally well, one of my friend picked up his drum stick and before he could go in for the bite a big chunk of chicken swan dived back in the bowl, and the beef pieces in my stew would shred apart each time I pricked one with my fork, needless to say our meats were very tender. At the end of our meal an employee cleared our table for us and offered us coffee, we declined but it was a nice gesture. We came with appetites and left with full stomachs, and instagram pics.
better food than london branches but the same off-hand service. perfect people-watching spot.
I had a pleasurable experience at this location. Jason Gudiel explain and provided all details. He answered all my questions and was very polite. I would definitely recommend this location
Op een vrijdagavond zonder reservering een gezellige en snelle bediening. We hebben heerlijk gegeten en de gerechten smaakten prima! De ambiance in het pand met zijn kleine gangetjes en grote chique opgedofte hallen doen je in een sprookje wanen.
Great food... :)
Good beer and good food. I enjoyed the "Brewbon" and a flight of their beers.
The girls here are Masseuses, not prostitutes. Carefully select your therapist. Shop around a little. I enjoy a sensual massage better than the "full service" and I have found the therapist I prefer. We have developed an excellent rappore based on mutual respect.
I have been going to this place for years and as far as I am concerned this is the best Mexican restaurant in Red Bluff. I give it 4 1/2 stars.
Great place for large celebrations; Not the best Mexican in Baton rouge though... Try Rio Grande for that! Service is friendly but not the fastest!

Stayed in this hotel after my previously arranged accommodation fell through. I wanted a single room with it's own bathroom, they had none available, but the Lady kindly offered me a triple room for the price of a single for one night. I asked to see the room before paying, just to see if I remotely liked it, at which point she became extremely rude & refused to let my friend look at the room with me, making him stay in reception. Apart from that, I was delighted with my stay, great price and good rooms, comfy bed & reliable shower. I would recommend this to anyone, now I do not know what the smaller rooms are like, but their price for a triple is still really reasonable for what you get.

Very good Sushi. Cool environment love going here with friends. I get several dishes and split with everyone at the table. THe sushi is always fresh and delicious I highly recommend this to any sushi lover. I do have to admit it is on the pricey side but if you are a sushi lover well worth it!
The hotel is lovely, in an old-fashioned, southern charm way, as are the rooms. The grounds, setting, and view are beautiful. The pool area is wonderful, with the lazy river and slides incorporated into a luxurious setting for kids and adults. The spa area has a spectacular indoor pool and beautiful spa garden for adults with a warm springs pool. All of the restaurants have great atmosphere - with some variety in style - and good food. Wide variety of activities, and our family really enjoyed the ones that we did - archery, horseback trail ride, gorge hike, and falconry. (Where else would you do falconry!?) I was unsure about the resort wear dress code, but found that it kept folks from wearing sweats and swimsuits all over the hotel, which was kind of nice. Staff were friendly and pleasant throughout the facility. I had to take off a star rating though because everything was overpriced. If you assume that the room rate is including the beautiful facility and setting, that's acceptable. But the hotel tacks on an additional "resort fee" which includes such standards as wi-fi and in room coffee. They include shuttles to activities in this fee, which should be folded into the activities fees, most of which are overpriced anyway - like double what they should be. The food is good, but not as fantastic as the prices would lead you to believe. Again, about twice as much as they should be for much of the menus. There aren't good options for a quick, cheap lunch - especially needed if you have the big buffet breakfast and want to splurge for dinner. The packages aren't a good deal unless you are committed to getting the most expensive options for every thing for every day. For instance, they price out at $30 a person for activities, when the choice of activities ranges from $12-$50. Same differences with food. We had a wonderful vacation in a beautiful resort, and I would recommend the Homestead for families. But I'd suggest to understand, accept, and plan for the pricing before you go. (Also make reservations for activities and dinner at least week before your trip.)

A Chinese friend of ours introduced us to his wonderful restaurant. we have been going to this restaurant for quite a while as the food is excellent...really authentic. the restaurant is always filled with mostly Chinese people who certainly know where to get a really good meal at the right price. We recommend this restaurant highly!

I have been coming to Taco Loco for a little over two years. Their food is wonderful! They have a great salsa bar. They have a good selection and their prices are very decent. The serving sizes are very large, I normally can get both lunch and dinner from one dish. The atmosphere is very authentic to the Spanish culture. The service can be a little lax and not overly friendly but overall this place is worth eating at.

From Turkish olive oil soap to duck sandwiches and gluten-free treats, this market is a surprisingly pleasant detour from the hustle and bustle to urbane London life----transporting one's body and senses through multiple continents and centuries. I felt like I was meandering somewhere between a the freshness of a Los Angeles farmers market and the enduring wonder of an Arab souk. The only reason I did not give it full marks is that I am one who is quite adverse to crowds, so with understandable reasonable, this treasure close by the London Bridge draws a plethora of people from all walks of life. Another benefit is that there is a Monmouth Coffee house closeby---my favorite coffeeshop in Londontown
Awesome place to visit, open all week 10 - 4.15pm. Sells really good quality flour! Now takes card payments at the mill!
Fresh local ingredients. Good fried fish and red rice. Fish obviously fresh and not overcooked. Excellent mac and cheese. Had the honor of trying their first homemade key lime pie which was great.
Great experience. No pressure or constant hounding from the salesman (unlike other dealerships (Cadillac)). Overall great service and pleasant time dealing with the salesmen to purchase my 2011 Lexus. I love my Lexus!
I completely disagree with Rahool in regards to Tayyabs being the only place to go. Roughly 10years ago the management changed and the original man (uncle Tayyab) changed over to a younger batch of staff and the food has never been as nice as the 90's and early 00's. With regards to Hayfield the food here is the best value in terms of taste and quantity in this price range (of roughly £10-15 per head) in all of East London. I'm not biased either as my father knew uncle Tayyab so well!

I found a hair in my food. They made me a new dish, but still charged me for it. Considering the price I paid, I was very disappointed.
Really cool place! Staff is knowledgable and the environment is comfortable. They tend to have problems with their credit card machine, so bring cash if you can.
About once a month I stay here for work and I have never had a problem here. The customer service is great.
This plays knows what they are doing.
My favorite barbeque in Richmond! My favorites are the pulled pork and ribs; the brisket here is good but I've had better in one or two places elsewhere. Really delicious smoky flavor in the meat and what tastes like an in-house BBQ sauce in the traditional Texas style. Bicycle delivery! Highly recommended.
I had my stuff fixed here. Takes a while but all worth it.

Huge space... Probably the biggest kfc in Mumbai and Navi Mumbai
Old school neighborhood bar with good food. Pizza is good but you need to order extra cheese on it as they don't really use enough cheese for our taste. The wings are awesome here! I have never seen my kids clean the bones like they do when we get them from Tim's! The garlic hot are our favs.
Tasty hamburgers! I give it 4 stars only because once the food was delivered no one came by our table for refills. It was busy and understaffed.
Gelsons is far from my neighborhood, but I always go there to stock up on meats. All their meat is free range, hormone and antibiotic free. The quality is very high. You would never get a steak with a streak of inedible gristle in it, as I have at Ralphs. Produce is expensive but better quality than regular supermarkets. No withered peppers as I have seen at Albertson's. regular groceries you are better off at regular supermarkets. Same products but cheaper.

I have found this restaurant to be one of the cleanest Chines restaurants I have ever been to. The food is fresh and the wait staff is always helpful and friendly. Very accessible from the highway.
The customer service at this Motel is the best. The building is a little run down but not uncomfortable. The cleaning service is great. I was in a hurry and left some coffee in my coffee maker but they cleaned it for me. Those are the little things that will bring me back.

I like the location: nearby to Kuta beach. Room is big, staffs are friendly, simple concept and just match to our expectation. Good for family and close to anywhere. Value for money and see you again when I come to stay in future.
Great food, great prices. It's a really small establishment... A little old and rundown. The multiple course meals are perfect for 2-3 people, especially at such a cheap price. Food was delicious, just as good as some more expensive places.

Went here last night for the 150th episode of HIMYM. And I would never have though about going to a bar to watch a tv show, but it was actually really fun. They (like pretty much all bars now) have 12-23 televisions and they were all playing HIMYM. It was pretty cool.
The husband and wife team who run the pub make you feel as if you belong there, firstly by having a photographic memory of your face and pairing that with the usual drink, and secondly by remembering that you have been tramping the hills above Tillicoultry and might be a tad thirsty. I would recommend this pub to you - particularly if you like real ales, but also if you like real Guinness as I do.
Food is good, price is good, service is fast. Highly recommended.
I love the free internet, and the atmosphere. It is conducive to getting online work done while relaxed. I had a breakfast burrito, which was delicious! (And they are not stingy with the filling!) I have iced coffee every visit, and it is always delicious! As far as internet goes, it is fast and reliable, and it is nice to sit at the bar while online, watching the traffic go by.
This place has so much to discover! There is nothing else like it. Wonderful venue for events.. drag shows are a hoot. Events are unique and enjoyable.
We ordered delivery fron this place. The person on the phone must've been the most monotonous sound my wife has ever heard. Any how, tge food came and tge pizza was excellent. The Caesar's was great too! Tgeir boneless wings... another story. But the pizza was absolutely great. Highly recommended

Here's the thing: Tito's is simple and to the point. You definitely have your pan dulce covered with some of the best concha, cuernos, besos, and mantecados in Long Beach. Even better: their burritos. Aim for the breakfast but if you're late, no worries: their regular burritos are awesomeness.
Best egg rolls anywhere. Only wished they delivered.
Très bon et très bon accueil
Compared with CalFit, there are advantages and disadvantages. The price is awesome at less than a third, people go there to work out instead of be the "mom's social club" although you run into large groups of the Affliction/Air Jordan crew that loves to go in huge groups and fill up the place, always plenty of cardio machines...Disadvantages would be that some in demand machines only have one unit and bummbells only go to 100. All in all, I'm glad I made the switch and am better for it. Desk staff is friendly and hours are great, I always go before the crowds.

Service has gotten better since my last review. After my last bad experience, I swore to never go there again. I gave them another shot and they've been getting it done right ever since.

it is a giant museum about dinorsours and animals. My favoirote was the T-rex and they have an area for eathquakes so you know what it is like to experince one this is awesome. It is free to enter but it can be quite crowed !!! so avoid going on the weekends.
There variety of fried foods are the best in the area bar none. Popeyes and church's and all the other fried chicken establishments watch out there's a new head on the fast food chain and thats doans seafood grill
Excellent best place go here!
Walking around downtown just stopped in to look at the menu to see if it fit our hunger and we decided to sit down. Their special was a chile verde and it was excellent, just like my great grandma used to make it. The other item ordered was a fish and chips and it was very good. Also since we did come in the gave us a meatball appetizer for free and that was very tasty as well. The only thing I did not like was that their selection of beer was limited to light beers like lagers and such. But other then that it a place that I will continue to go.
The food was fresh and hot. Customer service was excellent.
I love their Mexican food! I eat here at least once or twice a week so I am a regular! I walk in the sit down and they already know what I want! There's no other place like it!

I was given the opportunity to play this course for the first time and loved the course. It plays long on some holes, especially with the wind. It is a fairly flat course as would be expected playing in the middle of farm fields. The 15th hole is a little deceiving as you are playing over in essence a swamp instead of open water. Great challenge to start a round of golf with a 545 yard par 5 first hole. Overall for the price you pay to play this course, you are getting a great value. We will be back and and my 9 year old is chomping at the bit to try this course as well.
I got the pork loin dinner. It was really good. My girlfriend has a list of allergies, that were provided upon making my reservation, and I felt like they did not really try to cater to her or provide good recommendations. She is highly allergic to fish and the waiter tried to push a sale of swordfish on her. Water glass was never empty and I never felt like they were hovering. I spent $110 (including tip) for 1 appetizer, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. Fairly pricey in my book.

Our family did not know what to expect visiting an Ostrich Farm in Curacao Island while on vacation. It was quite a learning experience and somewhat of an exotic adventure--our daughter loved it and she got to hold an Ostrich egg-big stuff for a 5 year old.
This may look like a 'run of the mill' cafe on first glance, offering standard coffee and pasteries. However, this place is one of those little gems you only find now and again. It is run by a portuguese family, and retains that family touch, very friendly service and really reasonable prices. The coffee here is brilliant (They import it from Portugal.), and the pateis de nata is great. At the back of the cafe they sell lots of portuguese produce including bacalau and frozen foods. Downstairs they have a cellar with the best selection of protuguese wine in London 'apparently'. Definitly recommend this
Clean and comfortable.
Nice place with fast and quality service. The staff is always polite and trying to do the best of our stay.
You wont find many places to sit, don't expect wait staff, or cutlery, but the food is good, the service is personal. Breakfast was tasty and filling
Laura loves the crawfish. Ordered 2 pounds. Needs better crab options on menu for being called a crab house
Always order delivery from New China.. Service is great and food is good too. Timely delivery( most of the time) and love the Crab Rangoon, Bourbon Chicken and the boneless Spare Ribs. :-) Yum PLUS~ they have Pepsi-- BONUS!!!
I was going over to another shop to sell my I Pad 4 when a guy stopped me and asked if I was looking for a loan on my I Pad. I said I was looking to sell it and he explained that he was with Big Daddy's and that they loved Apple products. I went in and he looked it over and asked what I wanted for it. I named my price and he said that seemed fair. After they checked it over, including making sure it connected to the Internet, they had me filled out a little paperwork (nothing major) and paid me my money. I sold items to other pawn shops and found that they checked what the item sells on Amazon or Ebay. Because of that it seems that most places will pay as little as they can get away with. Big Daddy's didn't do that. Big Daddy's will not rip you off. If your price is fair, you will probably get it. If it's too high, they will explain why they can't meet your price. If I ever need to sell anything again, I will be going back to Big Daddy's.
Of course the walleye is excellent but try the burgers are also very excellent also..

Went for all you can eat King Crab legs. Have I had better King Crab ... yes, but this was very good. The bill with tip was not cheap, but well worth it. Our waiter, Brian, was awesome. Was attentive, never let our drinks get low, and made sure to have a steady stream of crab legs coming our way. Not once were we waiting on more until we couldn't eat anymore. I will be more than happy to try out Landry's again, even on a night that is not all-you-can-eat.
Conveniently located near the junction of Milton and the interstates, clean room, nice continental breakfast, and fairly quiet too. Nothing fancy but worth the price.
Eponymous cajun/creole menu that can be overwhelming at times. Imagine a NY diner sized menu with over 100 different creole dishes? It's impressive but you wonder how they can make everything on that menu with the same level of quality. Drinks are good as well as the scene. Great for lunch on a warm summer day with a friend!
滿好吃的，慶祝的好地方，但真的有點貴。
Delicious lattes with a sweet and simple cafe experience. I'm happy to have this quality coffee shop in the fort point area Things I wish they did: as someone who knows my coffee, it drives me crazy that their menu calls everything "epsresso + water" or " espresso + milk" it has a name.
I have two children in classes. One child is just beginning. The other is in "Level 3". The instructors are great. The facility is clean and well maintained. The business-side of the business could use some improvement. One reviewer already mentioned having difficulty contacting the staff and receiving a call back. I can attest to that as well. They accommodate working with our schedule and makeups for missed days are typically easy to arrange. On the instruction/learning side of the business, some weeks are better than others. There does not seem to be a well designed discipline or behavior-correcting policy. Some prior classmates listened terribly, and distracted from class. Although class sizes are small (3 kids each), one unruly child makes the whole event fruitless. When it does go right, which is almost all of the time, my children have a fun time and show considerable improvement. The instructors work well with each child, understanding what skills they need to improve upon and coaching with patience.
I had my haircut from Ms. Shu and she was very attentive and great! I was very satisfied with the cut. Only $13 - so I gave a great tip. Glad I found a new place to call my barber for as long as I'm in the area!

I haven't taken classes here but my wife teaches an independent Irish Dance class at these studios and I'm in the studio a lot. These are some of the friendliest people with real passion and a longevity teaching dance to youngsters. The studio is always clean and serves a lot of different purposes for different community needs. I've peeked in on some of Sue's own dance classes and she is a strong teacher: demanding in her standards but kind and personal in her approach. Definitely worth supporting this independent dance family!

Have had almost every type of pizza they make here as a 'Zone. Find that all the ingredients are fresh and the pizzas are very flavourful. Have had the occassional over done one, but never to the point that I won't eat it. Service has always been great, and the staff is friendly. Hands down the best pizza place in town.
Variedad a buen precio. Terraza muy agradable. Solemos venir y siempre tenemos que hacer cola para conseguir mesa.
This place is now called "Bavarian Haus Lakefront Inn". Staff was nice, room was clean, rates were a bit high for the area, but considering the amenities, it was worth it. Rooms open out to the lake, and has a beautiful sunrise. I would go back again.
Very kid-friendly, including a bookshelf full of kids books and stools for the bathroom sinks. No changing table, though. Our food was fresh-tasting pub fare, but bland.

Best crispy chicken I ever had and the rest of their dishes are in the same tasty category. Everytime me and my friends go there we receive excellent and quick service.

Okay, I hate the way the place looks inside, but I never go there. I order for delivery. And where it really counts they get it absolutely right. The food is AWESOME!! My biggest complaint with most Indian restaurants is they're so stingy with the meat. So many Indian restaurants, if you order a chicken dish for example, it will show up with maybe just 5-6 small bites of chicken on it. But Touch of Spice totally fills your plate with chicken. And their sauces are delicious. I love it! I used to think the prices were a little high - over $10 for most entrées. But when you consider how much more actual food you get than from the typical Indian restaurant it's well worth it. Definitely one of the absolute best Indian restaurants in the entire New York City area.

Great cust service, punctual technician service. Had terrible outside wiring that the tech (contractor) fixed, but went around the guttering instead of under it. Getting full rate (22Mbps, what I'm paying for) on speed tests, video tiles only occassionally downstairs but would have required a lot of digging/drilling to fix so the tech convinced me to leave it alone. Lockbox lid falling off the building, allowing theft, weathering, bugs, and vandalism. Trouble with HBO GO sometimes over 3G, but that's not Comcast's issue. Love the multi-room DVR! Wish the tech had been more thorough in rewiring, but video service works 99% of the time and internet is NEVER down. Very proud to be a Comcast customer.
I love the food at Minh Chau. I regularly go here for lunch as it's a short walk from my office. The service is not the best at times. Try to avoid having them come back since you need a minute. If you know what you want, just order it the first time they come over or it may be a little bit. Staff is friendly though so it's not the end of the world. Yes as others have said, it's a bit of a dive place and not a great date location (for new couples at least) but the food more than makes up for it. Don't be deterred by the other people on here, I have never had any issues with the food!

Very good quality chocolate varieties. Must visit
I went on a Friday and it was absolutely great! I think they tell you to avoid Mondays and Fridays so the place was practicly empty ha. The first lady was really short with me and gave me a hard time because I recently lost everything and couldn't exacly prove who I was, But the manager acually had a heart and helped me find out what I needed to do and was in and out in less than a half hour! great experince
Aside from finding parking for visitor this place is great for doing business.

I can understand some of the less favorable reviews on here- the customer service isn't always the best depending on when you go in or why you are there- but I really had a very good overall experience purchasing my wedding dress recently and a great experience with alterations. They were patient, kind and made my dress fit perfectly down to the last detail. If I had to do it over again, I would do it the same.
I've dropped by here on multiple occasions and have never had to wait very long, despite the fact that's always very busy - maybe I'm just lucky, but it's certainly worth noting. The staff here is extremely friendly (and sometimes very attractive). I'm not too big a fan of the brunch menu, but the lunch/dinner options are wonderful and I've been delighted each time. It's also a great place to bring a book and read while having lunch - I'd recommend choosing one of the window/booth tables. The decor is also very interesting, feels very bucolic inside. You can tell a lot of attention was paid to making sure the atmosphere felt just right!

Our family's been enjoying Piccadilly's food for 30 years. My children grew up on their food, and now we are bring our grandchildren to Piccadilly. The selection is exceptional, and the food is always seasoned perfect. The servers are always on their toes to help with anything you wish for. We drive around 40 miles to eat at Piccadilly once to three times a week. It's worth the time and the drive!

I've ordered from Shangri-La about 7 or 8 times the past year when my sister and I are in the mood for Chinese Food. We just look up the menu online and call the restaurant to order the food. One thing that I dislike was the delivery person. He sort of expects a tip and I usually give him a couple of bucks, though he drove about half a mile to deliver the food and he sort of eyes you down for a tip. It's odd and sort of rude. The food however is delicious and well-prepared, better than most places. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking to order from somewhere new :)
Park on the block, great service and pho
Don't let the outside fool you. This is a great hole in the wall.

We had camped there off and on through the years and this past summer we went back and we had a nice and relaxing time with our family and friends! The only thing we missed out on was the inground pool that we were told was finished and found out when we got there to sign in it wasnt finished:( but anyways we had fun fishing and playing games!!
Madame Tussauds, è il museo più bello che ho visto a Londra! Infatti ho visitato il British Museum e non sono rimasto tanto colpito, forse è un po noioso. Invece il Madame Tussauds è un vasto museo contenente le statue di cera che ritraggono le persone più famose del mondo, per esempio: Michael Jackson, Obama, la famiglia reale, il papa. il Dalai Lama, Rihanna e molte altre persone famose. Inoltre c'è la stanza dell'orrore dove a prima vista sembra una cosa di niente ma quando entri lì dentro, cambierai subito idea! Sempre lì dentro, si trova il cinema 4D dove verrà proiettato un cartone dei super eroi! Il museo, inoltre, ha uno store tutto suo dove potrai comprare tutti i souvenir che vuoi!

Wonderful for history buffs, whether Waterloo aficionados or readers of regency romances. I agree with the reviewer who said there should be a better catalog, so you could get information on any object, not just one or two per room. But even so, there is a lot to enjoy aesthetically and also in terms of human interest. For example, Napoleon hated the Canova statue, which depicted him as a naked Hercules, and made his actual average height look short and squat by comparison. The moment he saw it, Napoleon banished it to the basement of the Louvre. So of course, what object does Wellington make sure to bring home and feature in his main stairwell? Seemingly nice but profoundly insulting. And so on. Really, go!

Had the greek lamb wrap. Softest pita bread around. Reasonable prices too
I haven't had insurance for a few years so I went to CCHS and Dr. Margaret Taylor is the Family Planning doctor and she is an absolute delight! She's a nurse midwife and she is very informative. She was whipping out diagrams and explaining everything to me and I just felt really comfortable talking to her. The wait time in the lobby takes forever but Dr. Taylor is worth the wait.
Been there twice, once for lunch and once for dinner. Lunchtime they have a 2/3 course menu which is served very quickly. Both times the food was really really exceptional but beware, the serving portions are really quite small. It was okay for me as I'm a small eater but not so much for my hungry boyfriend...
I usually just get take out and the food is delicious.
Exploit John and Yoko , Mick an Keith, and every other original in your restrooms and then feature cartoon art in your bar. You can have your waitresses cook your "tapas" on a Geo Forman grille. The wait gals are bored at 8 pm and want to go home. So,[], pack it up and go camping, ASAP. Better off just going for an authentic bar, and getting a good burger, unless your gal thinks this is .....great.
Best theater in this area..
The food is excellent at this restaurant. It is an excellent display of culinary arts, a talent that Spain excels at. The name, meaning "the dove" is a thoughtful touch and shows just how personable this place can be. Inside it is very comfortable, not too big or noisy. It is a good place to go to enjoy a dinner with friends or to go out on a date. The price-quality ratio is pretty good, but at times it can be a little pricey. Definitely would go back!
Great coffee shop in Downton Denver.
Service was good.
Great pizza (and other food), but a bit pricey.
A very classy theater for the common people. Food and Beverages could be improved.

Nice place to meet for business or studying groups or couples
The staff is kind here, I don't sleep with pajamas and never encountered bed bugs. Its quiet so I was able to get two good nights of sleep. Over all it was very clean but they could do a better job of cleaning the tub out. The shower head has good pressure and allows for easy changes to the settings. For some reason the window in my room opened all the way and had no screen. All in all it is a good place to stay when in town, with easy access to and from the interstate and close to restaurants. Has a rather small pool but it was fenced in and secured as well as very clean. Although I did not use the pool, I would've had no problem if I felt the need. And for the $58/night that I paid in mid June, it was perfect!

The food is wonderful. The Fries are fresh and have a good seasoning. The fish is wonderful and taste fresh. Cut back on the fried shrimp because if you eat to much you will be sick and will never want to eat shrimp ever again. It happened to me now every time i think about the shrimp I fell sick :(

We were there in the beginning of July 2012. The hotel itself is beautiful and the surrounding gardens and landscaping are very nice as well. The food was ok (not too great). The swimming pool was great. The only bad thing is that it should have a convenience store close by or even inside the hotel. If you need to buy something as simple as tooth paste, or Aspirin there is nothing nearby. The closest stores are at Coco Beach which is like 30min away from the hotel. Other than that it was good.
The Doctors and Nurses are incredibly hard working and dedicated, thanks.They stitched up my head from an glassing incident back in 2010,i was so happy but sad at the same time.Cause i left this wonderful hospital with good well behaved patients. and nurses looked after us 27/7.I was there for 4 days and it was not a good experience because I was glassed.but the service there is absolute awesome I say thanks to all the doctors and the nurses that looked after me there thank you all for Ur wonderful time and service.
Nice atmosphere. Micro shrimps over a Lobster are nonsense. Fish and chips are cheap but the fish isn't a fillet but nuggets. Grilled shrimps which actually are fried are tasty!
Sehr schönes und leckeres essen . Bedinung freunbdlich und zuvorkommens Preis leistung Top . gehen immer wieder gern hin
Clean place awesome weed and laid back people from all walks of life. Met a 6th grade teach that share some mind blowing hash. Found a great house boat to live on near Jolly so I'll be visiting back when I return.
I've heard great things about Premium Nissan, especially that their prices were fair. I was pleasantly surprised by the service of this dealership. I was in and out in a flash, and everything went smoothly. I traveled all the way in from North Jersey. These guys were on the ball! My salesperson Frankie Wells was fabulous. He knew everything there was about my new Altima. I had a small issue with not having an extra key which Nissan Corporate forgot to send. Thank God, Premium Nissan was competent enough to walk me through the particulars. The general manager Igor Tselnik actually contacted me twice to make sure that I was taken care of, and that my needs were attended. I will definitely go back to this dealership for future vehicles for my business and will recommend this dealership to my family and friends. I hope that Nissan Corporate appreciates these guys.
Nice place. Horrible wifi.
Recomendable
Das Ambiente ist gemütlich eingerichtet, und wird von ausgesprochen freundlichen Personal geführt.
One thing to watch out for that not many others have mentioned - it's pretty small inside and the seating is all very close together. Not somewhere for busy times or a discrete chat.
Everything was great and reasonably priced. The cakes are exquisite. Ok my review is a bit biased as we got our coffee and cakes for free on account of a wee accident.
An excellent all round experience of Indian food. The food is excellent wither eating in or as a take away. Service is great and freindly. Take away can get busy in the evenings and at weekends but worth the wait.
We were on hole 7 and were greated by your superintendent he was a buthead screaming at your employees infront of our foursome. If we pay so much for a piece of stress free enviroment ...please keep it that way.....i guess you change superintendent cause the last one was nicer....not going.back to bali hai..ever...

Used them for years, never had a problem. We referred a few neighbors (our whole neighborhood homeowner's association ended up using them as our chimney sweep of choice) and I know they were also pleased with the quality of work. Dallas Chimney and Wildlife is an honest and high integrity company from my experience.

While goung through training in Newport, I decided to partake in sone seafood and saw this place along America Cup Dr. Thought I'd give it a shot, and had an enjoyable experience. The service was very good. I had the crabcakes, and they were all right...more breading than crab meat. However, the seafood casserole I ordered was outstanding. I would recommend that dish to anyone who likes the thought of fish and shellfish together in a dish that isn't fried. The price is a bit expensive, but the quality was very good.
I met the team at Autosys, Inc earlier this year. They are energetic and positive as they work efficiently to provide very good auto care. I had a quote from another well known shop in the area. Autosys was able to complete the same job for $300 less and offered a free follow up for me to ask any questions. Great work, great rates!
Good growth and knowledge with performance benefits and i recommend.

I was on my way to the Falls Deli when I discovered this little Eatery. Man what a shock....Wake Forest does not have much to say for itself when it comes to a style with food and atmosphere. I had two slices and garden salad, needless to say I could not finish but one slice, they were HUGE. And the sausage was real Italian sausage sliced sideways on my slice with plenty of it. Great sauce and a good quality cheese. The owner went out of his way to accommodate me with my strange salad request. My lunch was so good that I called back and ordered my dinner an Ay Caramba!! A loaded down Taco Pizza to take home, and some Pasta and another one of my salads. Let me tell you this place can quickly become my lunchtime favorite!! Thanks Ziggy's for giving Wake Forest something to look forward too!!!

Une très bonne crêperie. Les cocktails sont même servis avec une brochette de bonbons !
This is a really neat place to go shopping, enjoyed it quite a bit.
I have been living in Aztec Springs for the past 16 months and would say this is one of the better complexes I have lived in. I love the fact that they have 3 pools, one of which is heated, so that the community pools aren't crowded or overfull giving people a more relaxed experience within them. The staff is very professional and responsive to any issues that arise, usually within 24 hours of them being called in.
Stopped here on my way to the villas at tree tops. Great service, good atmosphere and most importantly excellent food. Had gorgonzola smothered steak with sweet potato fries. Had crab cake and soup as an appetizer and finally creme Brule for dessert. Prices are fair and the wait staff is friendly. Would definitely stop here again.

Taste is good. Especially service is fast. But for vegetarians, menu is limited.
The food was very good and the price was right. We were greeted and seated as soon as we walled in by friendly staff. The food was to our table very quickly. Well certainly be eating here more often.
Lots of variety in bikes, friendly staff and one of the few places where you can actually get an electric bike repaired!
I was referred to Dr. Matt about a year ago. I am a businessman who is constantly traveling and working at an extreme pace. Before I became of patient of Dr. Matt's I constantly suffered from headaches, fatigue, back pain, and server allergies. These were affecting my performance in the marketplace. Dr. Matt got me back on track and now my body is truly healthy. He "equipped me physically, to do all God has called me to do" in life. I haven't been sick in 2 years, and my body now fights off any virus I come in contact with. I never lose a beat. Dr. Matt's and his team helped me clean up my diet as well and I now feel more alive than ever before. I perform better, think sharper, and live a more full life than ever before. If you've looking to take your game to the next level, Dr. Matt is your man! He runs a great business, his team is superb, and his integrity is unmatched. You will not regret seeking his help with your health!less

We had a good experience with Brisbane Electricians Network, we had our old queenslander rewired and they did a great job.
We tried a few different menu items, but the real standout was the macaroni and cheese. This is not your mama's mac & cheese. This is a true experience. I won't ruin it with a detailed description. Just order it, close your eyes, and take a bite.
Delicious food, The Knuckler is a must have original sandwich! Very impressive selection of craft beers on tap and in bottles as well.
This was a very nice place to stay, I give it two thumbs up!
Nice store
Excellent facilities..♥
Although the service in the fan department was excellent the checkout process is wretched. They tried to upsell me on three things. If I wanted a MyLowes account I would do it myself but I have no interest in additional emails thank you and don't care to hear the clerk explain why I should get one. If I wanted a $10 one year service warranty on my $80 fan I would be an idiot. If I wanted to donate to a cause I will choose the cause myself. I quit shopping at Sears for this very reason. At least Lowes has express checkout lanes to avoid the hassles. Still, just let me check out please.

I have read plenty of reviews about this place on several websites. I went into my stay objectively so I could come home and write a review. It is not correct to classify this as a hotel. It is a guest house, or traditionally speaking, an inn. It has the look and charm you would expect of a place in those categories. It does not fit into the cookie cutter mold of the $89-$109 per night hotel with a free breakfast… and that’s a good thing. We went with another couple and after seeing how different their single-king room was from our single-king room I can only assume every room is unique. I think it’s the perfect place to stay as far as the location. It was less than five minutes to Laffite’s Blacksmith Shop (the effectual end of the Bourbon Street party), ten minutes to Frenchman street, and about the same to Jackson Square. What this adds up to is that it’s very close to the action but just far enough away that you can easily sleep off the night before well into the daytime hours (thanks to the blackout curtains). The office is located on Ursulines, about midway between Royal and Bourbon. The desk clerks I encountered were friendly, attentive, and happy to help. The office is pretty bare bones but they do have coffee and pastries in the morning. There is not a designated place to temporarily park while you check-in but there is a driveway/loading area about 30 feet from the office where you can easily pull over and unload. The parking lot is located about four blocks away at the corner of Kerelec and Chartres. It was $20 per night to park. Remember, you’re in the French Quarter. I was happy to pay $20 to park my car in a neighborhood lot. There is a locked gate on Ursulines next to the office. This opens to a narrow walkway which leads to the courtyard. All rooms empty into the courtyard. There are two opposing buildings on either side with a hot tub at one end. I was going to take a picture but I decided a picture would not really do it justice. As soon as we saw it, my wife and I looked at each other and agreed that the courtyard was “so New Orleans”. Our room was #3, at the entrance end. The other room I mentioned was #5, at the other end of the same building. Both rooms were very modern: new furniture and lighting, a comfortable bed, clean hardwood floor, and updated bathroom. The only thing I noticed that might turn some people off was the gap in our door. To us, this was part of the charm. The bottom line: it was worth the price and I’ll be staying here again.
Sitio muy concurrido por transportistas. Donde comer, dormir y relajarse. Yo recomiendo acercarse al pueblo para admirar el paso de la autovia. Expectacular. Un saludo para todos
I seriously like this place. Great variety of dawgs, crazy creations, and lots of great toppings. My favorite is the downtown dog - a big bacon warpped dawg with mayo, onions, mustard and I add jalapanoes. Just like downtown but without the food poisoning! Seriously, they have so many great creations and funny names like the Abe Fromans (remember Ferris Bueler?).

I called ahead to make sure they had the product I wanted, and the woman on the phone made sure to check the floor and offered to hold it for me without any prompting. I've been on the phone or internet all day looking for this product and this was by far my best customer service experience today. Given the previous reviews, looks like this store is turning around.

While not mind-blowing, the food was fresh, portion size was fairly generous and service was very quick. Overall, just a nice cafe.
I loved every year at constitution highschool. I was able to meet some very interesting people there. The environment was one where I could feek free to show case my talent as a Poet/Rapper. All the Teachers who were there when I went were great, I'm pretty sure the new ones they have are just as good. The school isn't big at all so it was easy to get around.overall constitution is a great school I'm glad to have gone there.

The staff are friendly. The free WiFi and the no-extra-charge policy for the dog were much-appreciated bonuses on this unexpected stay in the Binghamton area. It was also nice that Cacciatore, a very decent Italian restaurant was near-by.
Try the calimari - its incredible. The firehouse has a great selection of on tap beers, some of which are not very common in Sydney. A great Thursday/Friday night haunt.

I been looking for good Asian food locally and I finally found a restaurant that's pretty good. By the title of the restaurant you wouldn't know it serves Thai food as well. We tried the drunken noodles, green curry and spring rolls on our first order. Our food was ready to pickup in 15 minutes and was really delicious. Excited to have such good Thai food close to home. Will definitely be ordering from here again soon.

It a place where I can enjoy with my friends and family without thinking who l am.
Don't know what these other people are talking about. Food was very good; we had burger and wrap. And at a brewery you order a beer, not a mixed drink.
Awesome lake... And Jocassee Lake Tours is the very BEST way to experience Lake Jocassee!

You cant go wrong with TGIF....the food is good and the drinks price right! I like the bar area
good food! But why they don't hire good waiter?

Geeentee...! A primeira vez que fui ao "Divino Mestre" foi por indicação de uma pessoa amiga, e posso dizer que a recomendação valeu a pena. Todas as vezes que viajo a Curitiba, a visita ao "Divino" já está na agenda. Esse é o mais agradável restaurante/churrascaria da cidade, pois lá se somam, ambiente, simplicidade, conforto, quantidade, variedade, qualidade... Além do que, tem até um feijãozinho do tipo "da fazenda", e o atendimento pessoal da equipe é destaque. Recomendo.!

Very tasty sushi.
Awesome place with nice ambience. Mains are priced similar to other fine dining restaurants and equally tasty. Would go here anytime...
Pricy, but everything in Akumal is these days. It was ok however I would expect for for an 80,00 US for a meal for 2.
The guys that work here are great. They do a good job and let you know what else you may want to look into without making you feel like you are getting another sales pitch.
I went there for business and was pleasantly surprised by the food court with reasonably priced fresh fish grilled or deep fried, friendly service in a kind of DYI atmosphere and contagious friendly conversation from table to table.
Good food, good music,big TVs...and WiFi!

I was happy to find the car I was looking for, a 2009 Subaru Impreza, at Autos Direct Online. Ashley was my sales person and she did a good job of guiding me through the whole car buying process. I was also very pleased with the price of the car that I bought.

I've been back to Hot Wingz numerous times, and plan to keep this as one of my go-tos. The wings are tasty, and for portion size, you purchase by the pound, so if you get a small portion, it's because you bought a small portion! Lol! I happen to enjoy the fried pickles, and the sweet potato tots, as well as their wings! It's a great place to have a group of people because it's a quickie joint, and the staff is very attentive. All in all, if you go in expecting a four star restaurant, yeah, you're gonna be disappointed. If your yen is for wings done really well, then check this place out for yourself.
Good rooms and what not but they charged an additional 200 dollars on our card when we checked in in case we broke anything which I didn't like, also WiFi was garbage, 0.03 up and .32 down on full bars

Recently stayed two nights at the Resort for a golf tournament. Nice place overall, but some things to be worked on as well. The Ridge course exceeded my expectations, the Point course was great too, the rooms were fantastic and the décor and furnishings quite comfortable. The bed was awesome and having a flat screen t.v., mini-kitchenette and separate bathroom from the middle common room with kitchen and full-sized fridge was a nice feature too. The blinds on the windows were great as well at keeping out light when you didn't want it. The food was not great and the service left a bit to be desired inside the Resort, but on the course the people were overall very nice and prompt with service delivery. I was disappointed with no store being available for hygiene products, groceries, snacks, etc. in the Resort and think it a big deficiency in the present set up. The pool and the hot tubs outside looked nice and appealing, but I didn't get the opportunity to use them. I would encourage extending the hours later - 10 p.m. is too early for a hot tub on a +30C night. Perhaps allow private bookings of the facilities later in the night - then a measure of security can also be maintained in the area. Liked the underground parking a lot and think the only thing that needs to be added is additional luggage trolleys at the underground entrance to the Resort. There were 4 trolleys in the front lobby for those who arrived at that door, but none available conveniently for those parking and going up to their rooms from underground. Overall I think the rating of 4.0 is pretty accurate. Work on some of the details and it won't take long to get to 5.0. I will stay again - it's worth hoping in that time some of the weak parts will be strengthened.

Some of the best pizza I've ever eaten. Only the best ingredients. Staff is friendly and service is fast.
It's Saturday evening, 9am and it's me and my daughter. She's having butter chicken and I'm having chicken tandoori (hot), malagawtani soup with a mango lassi. There are only 2 other tables with customers which is nice for us. The food has always been really good here so hopefully it will be delicious now!

Great Bar & Grille restaurant. The food always good, I'm so surprised that people have not posted many reviews but then again always full seems like locals. The servers are quick and seem to watch if you need something. They have from steaks, burgers, wings and much of any type of good food you are looking to eat. Here in Avon, Oh stop in and have some great food, fun and spirit.
Best sushi in town.
Excellent
La Parilla, actually. This Puerto Rican full service spot sports local cuisine with seafood and meat. There are several varieties of mofongo and arepas in addition to steak and lobster. It is located at the Western edge of the kioskos between Rio Grande and Luquillo just North of PR3. Parking available. The other line of 30 or so kioskos range from walk-up service to full service, anywhere from a dollar an item to $50 a plate. Bring cash if you want to explore the range of offerings from stand to stand.
Excellent service and atmosphere :-)
Great food. They have a bunch of tapas that you can make a meal out of if you order 3-4 of them. They do a great job with parties also. They have a nice party room downstairs with a bar and bathrooms.
Its all about the fries! Sooo good! Plus gluten free buns is a bonus!

This is one of the prettiest caravan parks I've seen. It's super-spacious - most parks pack everyone in - here everything was far apart - we could not hear anyone, and could see few. It has a pool, tennis court, trampoline & playground. Clean showers and toilets. It is rustic and not at all glossy, but comfortable.

We had some expectations to purchase a used Honda in the near future after much on-line research. My 2001 Accord has 260,000 miles and continues to serve our family well. We got the our initial lead from on-line sites like carguru and auto trader. We were focused with what we wanted (price/value/type) which made our visit very focused. Our sales associate, Jordan D, was a pleasure to work with for a number of reasons. He was prompt in returning emails and phone calls, and during his day-off, the car sales manager was able to respond promptly. He was not overly persuasive in his approach yet he was willing to show us as many cars as we desired. We feel we received a fair price for the vehicle and they will fix a paint bubble/ chip on the front fender without extra cost. I refrain from a 5-star rating because we are only a few days into our car. When I return to get the paint fixed or scheduled maintenance I hope they earn the last star. On a personal note, I can say Jordan continues to show great character as a former active-duty Marine in showing our family respect and honor. We wish Jordan the best in all he does. If you want someone that will actually listen and not hound you every turn, Jordan is your guy.
I like it because it's all that I can afford. I go to the school across the street from it, and often I'll meet up with friends to see a movie. It normally has a great selection of movies to choose from. The food is expensive. Like, *really* expensive. But, that's what you get for cheap tickets I suppose. Often, the place smells of bad breath and dirty bathrooms, but with a hint of.. mint? It's like they try to cover the odor with not enough good odor. I think it makes it even worse. The crowds aren't always nice, but I suppose that's not the theatre's fault.

Probé croquetas de la casa y bastante buenas, los precios decentes y la atención también. Falta algo de variedad en sidra. Lo recomiendo
Not bad. Not bad. Not the best but respectable. I'll come again. Not too expensive and good people.
It seems like every time I come to this place it gets prettier. It used to my favorite restaurant when I was a kid. The pizzas are just amazing. A little bit on the expensive side though.
Didn't have as many animals as I would have liked
Nice surprise for someone craving a proper bowl of pho.
It's great that in the years since the original Wanamaker's family sold to Bloomingdale's and now Macy's, the great pipe organ, that impressed me as a little girl still is played and is kept beautiful. They Christmas light show is stunning. I do prefer the original non digitalized light show from in the day. I guess it shows my age.
This place is amazing it is a little pricey but you get what you pay for and there food is AMAZING !!!
JBC offers great coupons. They typically can get you inn for service quickly. Will return.
Locale ottimo, ampio parcheggio, cucina locale, ottime le pizze.
Bluewater Cafe is our favourite local regular restaurant. Our daughter loves playing in the children's wonderland at the back and we love the breathtaking views and lovely food. Horses roam the meadow in front, peacocks cry and strut their amazing fan tails, and across the wetland we can see the turquoise blue surf of Noordhoek beach beneath Chapman's Peak. If the weather is calm, it is heavenly, but equally a challenge when the south-easter blows hard. We all agree that the Bluewater pizzas are some of the best we have ever had - anywhere. We also have severe allergies and food intolerances in our family, and this restaurant has become a firm favorite within our circle of safety. The owner as well as the staff have really made an effort to make our meals there an enjoyable and stress free experience - to the extent that they now have a dedicated pizza recipe (not on the menu) referred to under my wife's name. The only thing to be aware of is that service can be very slow at times, and they are closed all day Monday and half of Tuesday. Also, if you do not enjoy children, peacocks and chickens running freely around your dinner table, you should choose to dine inside.

Very interesting, and well kept. Some parts of the ship are stuffy but most are well ventilated and cool. One thing to note though is that is ship is not very wheelchair accessible as the only way to go up is by VERY steep stairs. Overall very good museum and exhibit.
I love Lake Chabot Golf Course . It is a challenging course that is maintained very well. Their greens are consistently smooth. My only complaint is that the pace of play is too slow due to poor marshaling. I believe that this course could speed up play by reminding golfers of their responsibility to get behind the cage at nine and waving up the next group.
they are great. they have all the stuff I need for my ATV at a great low price etc. etc.

Muy bueno, también hay servicio en español, además de la buena comida, el único fallo es que no había corona.
I love this place, and my wife and I have never had anything other than a great meal here. Our friends are locals and we go with them a lot. Its sometimes a little crowded, but that's fine with me. The risotto's are amazing! The pizzas are always tasty. Make sure you check out the specials of the week. A pretty darn good rum selection, and a great place to grab a Boh on a Friday night with live music. I can't wait to go back!
Took voice lessons here for six years with two teachers, and felt very prepared to study voice at the college level. Great place to study music.
The staff is great, location is great for business and personal
great taste and great value. real, authentic food. service is so-so but very friendly.
Had a fantastic time here, and the food was wonderful. Would highly recommend.

ممتاز خاصه البهو .. يعرض تراثيات من سيارات اثريه و أثاث واجهزه قديمه ... كأنه متحف .. لكن الغرفه بسيطه ولا يوجد ديكورات لكنها واسعه ولها بلكونه بأطلاله جميله على البحر
value in Alaska is relative, but they have a fair price for Alaska
i visit this place very often. my favorite meal there is the new england clam chowder. nice and creamy and lots of good flavors. The have a patio and live entertainment during the summer, great place to hang out, have some GOOD seafood and relax.
Pink's is fantastic - definitely the best pizza you can find in Houston! So glad to have a N. Shepherd location.
I've used the services of this company in the start of the winter because I understood I've had a leak in the roof and used this company to repair it.
Very nice food and good portions at a very reasonable price. It is a little touristy but if you just want a nice quiet evening out this is worth checking out.
Schon mehrfach hat uns Zeitwohnen Rhein Ruhr mit einem schnellen und unkomplizierten Vermittlungsservice weiter geholfen, wenn wir kurzfristig möblierten Wohnraum in Köln für Kollegen und Geschäftsfreunde suchten. Die sehr freundlichen und kompetenten Mitarbeiter haben bis zum Mietvertrag alles organisiert inkl. Wohnungsübergabe am Wochenende. Eine Projektwohnung lag zwar etwas über dem Budget, dafür aber exakt im gewünschten „Lieblingsviertel“ am Rudolfsplatz. Vielen Dank :-)
Their wings are the best!!
We are very happy about this hotel. The price is reasonable and the bus station is right next to the hotel. It only takes about 15 mins to get to Venice. The host are very friendly and helpful. I will definitely recommend it to you.
O'Toole's has a nice selection of comfort foods in a laid back atmosphere. Live music and other in-restaurant activities can be very entertaining. The best seat in the house, on a chilly winter's day, is around the fireplace. Definitely a good place to go for a few drinks, hang out with friends, and relax.
We ate sea scallops, fried clams, lobster roll, fried oysters fried shrimp clam chowder, zesty corn chowder,seafood gumbo. Boston cream pie and key lime pie it was all great. The owners are from Rhode Island and the seafood we ate was tagged from Massachusetts. It is a small spot in a plaza but it is worth it. They are expanding, in February they will have 150 seating capacity. If you love seafood and want to eat in a relaxed atmosphere this is the place.
one of the most famous doctors in calangute, goa. only problem is that you will have to wait for atleast 3 hours to consult Dr. Dukle. his treatments are quiet effective.
It risky... u should go with group. Couple takes special care.
Very quiet. . almost dead airport! . .
hot coffee, cold seat.
Chris & Karen are very attentive and caring sales people
great people come in and have some fun. peter miller is the highlite.
Er ist ein sehr netter mitarbeiter, viel freundlicher als die Menschen, die in fahrrad-Sperk, Ottobrunn arbeiten. Er weiß, was er macht, er ist ein sehr kompetenter Arbeiter. Er bittet um ein bisschen mehr für seine Dienste, aber das ist zu erwarten, da es ein kleines Geschäft ist. He is a very nice man, much kinder than the people who work in fahrrad-sperk, ottobrunn. he knows what he is doing; he is a very competent worker. he asks for a bit more for his services but this is expected since it is a small shop.
Quick and easy. Izzy was very helpful. Really like the vehicle I purchased, and it was a great deal. A warning on trade ins though: the manager gave extreme lowball on trade-in that was over $3000 below blue book value. I shouldn't have accepted it but I did. They then then proceeded to list the car I traded in for nearly double the price that they paid me for it. They didn't even take into account nearly $3000 in recent maintenance and new tires. They are great for customer service and car deals, but don't trust them to trade in your car.
Take the funicular Train up to the peak and have a good view of Penang.!
Barrett knows the Southern Boone area!
Old but not bad
A fantastic place to care for you and your family. Staff is nice and helpful, when it comes to your personal heath care they make it their policy to make you better.
Great seating plan. Go early to get a place. Don't go on sponsored nights to have more drinks available.
We purchased 1200 sq of carpet from Big Bob's and had them install it. The carpet is great and we are pleased with the quality. The installation not so great. There are 7 dents in the wall where we will have to spackel and paint. The corners of the wall are also nicked up and I will have to retouch. I would not recommend their installers if you have a choice.

I went here the other day and was pleasantly surprised. The food was fresh and tasty and the bubble drink (which are hard to find in Tallahassee) was really good. The service was pleasant - I never had to ask for a refill and never felt rushed or uncared for. If I had read the other reviews first, I would not have gone here. That being said, I had a very nice experience. Maybe my experience was a fluke, but if they provide that level of service consistently, it is definitely one of my favorite Asian restaurants in Tallahassee. I'll update the review after eating there again.

Great B&B...rooms are clean and tidy and always plenty of tea and coffee in the room. The breakfasts are lovely, and plentiful. The prices are very good too
Your carpet cleaners in Oxford managed to reinstate my old rug and now it is looking beautiful. It even looks better than before, you are a very professional and reliable company.
Great food, but go to Yuki's if you want sushi!
Great food, great service, but the poor guy was all alone. Server, prep and cash register. They need to get him some help a bit earlier for breakfast, especially when the locals roll in.
Their pizza is truly the tastiest in this area, it sets a new standard for pizza.
Senso crítico apurado e construtivo. Vale a pena tentar, que seja excelente a Copa das Confederações.
Tłoczno, ale poza tym - świetnie. Obsługa na wysokim poziomie, smacznie, miło. Polecam, jeśli komuś nie przeszkadza tłok.
So, it's a cheap Chinese buffet. That being said, my God is the food fantastic. The decor is kind of lame,stereotypical and dated, but the service is generally very good and the food is top-notch. For the price, there's no better buffet in town.

We stayed here after the last night launch for the space shuttle. Rooms are clean, the staff is friendly and is great value at $46/night, with the AAA discount. And, the breakfast buffet is just $9.00, and is good! Will return on my next road trip passing through Orlando.
Went to a Champagne and caviar tasting at Mel and Rose. Wonderful event!!!!!! Great selections of Champagnes and ample food to taste and try. Many interesting local vendors too. Mel and Rose put on a great tasting and are gracious and charming as well.

Biryani and Fried Rice are tasty here. Economic and Reasonable I will prefer this restaurant in Gachibowli area.

We had the shrimp chow fun and pan fried flounder. Found both to be great. The service was very prompt and friendly. The decor and ambience is what you would expect in Chinatown.
While the maintenance portion is quite pricey, they are very honest and thorough. After 5 maintenance visits, I haven't had to deal with any revisits due to a screwup or missed problem.
I have been there many times. Food is always good; prices are reasonable and service is usually good, too.
I had both of my children at Abington Hospital. My first son was born in 2009 and I had a emergency c section for a placenta abruption and was delievered by Dr. Rappe. She is the best and saved our lives!!! The NICU doctors and nurses were great and took great care of my son because he had to stay there 6 weeks until he was allowed to leave. My second son was healthy and also delivered by Womancare GYN in 2011. I would recommend the hospital to family and friends.
Neat, old shoe shop! Across the street from Court House! Good food!

They do good work but they can be unfriendly and condescending. They said things that made me feel like I was being talked down to. I could have done the repairs myself if I had the tools. So, good work, bad attitude. But maybe the two dudes who were unfriendly were having a bad day, or a lovers' quarrel. Either way, my window rolls up and down now and at the end of the day, that's what I wanted.
I very much enjoyed my experience. Staff was friendly and helped me pick out the perfect flavor for me after going through too many that I thought I would like. I would come here again. There are a few things I would recommend to make it better. Its called vape escape, so make if feel like people are getting away and have a relaxed place to go. Nothing fancy, maybe a couch and a TV in the overly accomodating floorset you have where vapers can buy there favorite flavor, kick back and relax. Again, other than way too much space that way too little was done with, I had an excellent experience. I liked it a lot. I would have loved it if there was more to it.
Nice I can hear. Great beer menu. Interesting food. I liked the tacos.
It took longer than I would've liked, but I'm very pleased with the workmanship. Bill was very helpful and very friendly throughout the whole process of getting my transmission replaced. I feel confident in taking my car there for other services.

"O3M" was recommended by one of my Business Associate and a friend. The assistance, strong & prompt followup provided by Harshal, Arun and their team was excellent. We could now understand the difference of having only website presence and promoting through Google. We are really thankful to O3M for their proper guidance to a layman in promoting the Website.
Great people in the sales, service (Bill B is a stand-up guy) and parts departments. They're always attentive, professional and helpful. Not 100% sold on the value of service work, however: Could be no one's ever happy to pay for repairs, but seems I've paid top dollar for good-but-not-great results. (Feels like 99th percentile prices for 80th percentile work; maybe that's just the way it is when you have to open your wallet?) I will say this, though: For a well-engineered car like a VW, skilled technicians and genuine parts are a must ... and at the dealer I know that's what I'll get.

Heerlijk eten, leuke sfeer. Wel en beetje massaal met zoveel mensen.
Lugar muito agradavel e com musica ao vivo.
Excelente sitio para las conciertos y con muy buena acústica. El público tiene la posibilidad de estar de pie o sentado en las gradas.
Tao's exotic atmosphere guarantees a fun time, whether you're going for drinks or dinner. The giants statue of a Buddha featured in the middle of the restaurant is definitely a highlight, and the food is delicious as well.
This place is the best authentic noodle shop in the city. The chicken cutlet noodle soup with udon is possibly the best I've ever had. The restaurant is a little worse for wear, but it's a hole in the wall, which makes the food authentic and amazing. I highly recommend this place!

Mr. Johnson arrived at the correct time and spent 90 minutes evaluating my furnace for a replacement, along with educating me and going over details of my options and prices, providing my two requested estimates. He was calm, methodical, friendly, clearly knowledgeable, and clear. I felt well taken care of, and would use their company again.
Great pizza, good price, fast delivery.
Sams is one of my favorite low key bars to go to around town. The food is great, beer is cheap and the servers are on top of it! You get away from the downtown hype, but can still enjoy karaoke on Friday nights, happy hour specials and good company. It's definitely one of my favorite places around town. And it's non-smoking now :) I highliy reccomend the chicken ceasar wrap, trivia outings on Wednesday night and two for one specials on Tuesdays!

Good food, great service and ambiance
We ate sushi. A lot of sushi. It was pretty good Sushi — not the best Sushi, but certainly good Sushi. I would recommend that if you're hanging around this particular part of town, you go grab some Sushi from this place.
Gente agradable y buen precio!!! recomendado! no hay garrafón.
The food's always fresh and the service is pretty good - they bring the food out to you and it doesn't take too long. I don't understand previous complaints about space. It's quite spacious unless you were expecting couches and a coffehouse-style place...which it isn't. It's an eatery. I always feel like I made a good choice eating here, and definitely recommend it for a lunch stop. Or a quick snack :)
หมูนิ่มมาก อร่อยดี กะทะเป็นดินเผา
Uno de los grandes clásicos de la ciudad de Palma. Enclavado en una de las mejores zonas comerciales, su amplia terraza está llena constantemente.
The food is tasty and prices are reasonable. Mongolian Beef and the Sesame Chicken were great. More a take out place then dine in. Definitely worthy trying : ) Anyone who complains about the staff being unfriendly is culturally inept.
This is a Harrisburg icon. One must have the Harrisburg Special with apples, no anchovies to truly wrap oneself around what Mackie's brings to the local body. The crust of the deep dish they serve has a comforting yeast roll sweetness about it that is unique to the area. A letdown is there is no beer with the pizza, but it doesn't detract from the overall dining experience. Another item on the order that is light and savory is the grilled chicken caesar salad. A recent addition of gyros to the menu is decent, just don't go expecting the greek diner experience or you will be let down. Overall however the gyros are good. Out of towners may come and go, they may love it or hate it. But the majority of 9500 residents of Harrisburg Illinois along with the surrounding communities will tell you that you will find no substitute...
Great service, good food, & value pricing. This is a nice quick-lunch option.

Prezzi un pò alti ma con la formula All you can eat si mangia in abbondanza. Buona qualità
Teocali is literally the only Mexican restaurant in town that I would recommend to someone who actually likes Mexican food. I grew up in the southwest eating LOTS of Mexican, and it took me a really long time to find somewhere in Kansas City that meets my exacting standards! Needless to say, this is that place! Pros: The food is outstanding... their enchiladas are as good as my mom and grandma's! The decor is fine... nothing fancy but it doesn't need to be. The owner is really nice and is very attentive to customers. He also seems to be around a lot which I think is helpful for running a restaurant smoothly. Cons: It tends to get really crowded, especially at lunchtime, so you will need to plan for that, or just be patient and not go when you're in a hurry. The waitresses in my experience are sometimes not great. Overall, though, I'd give Teocali 4 out of 5 stars... with 5+++++ stars for the cuisine!
Craft beer tasting inside, on tap, good selection of tasting brews, amazing selection of craft beers to purchase. Staff very knowledgeable and kind. Only place around here to get such good craft beer.

Un lugar donde podemos encontrar buena comida japonesa de excelente calidad. Al medio día tienen un menú con buen precio. La calidad de los cortes de pescado y la materia prima destaca por se excelente, el servicio es impecable y llama mucho la atención ver a gente de paises orientales comer y cenar en el restaurante, sin duda sinónimo de calidad.
VERY NICE! VERY HELPFUL! Beautiful high quality gowns for fairly affordable prices. I was looking for a dress with sleeves and a modest neckline which just isn't in style here in New Jersey, but Lisa, one of the owners, was very accommodating and had great suggestions! I would highly recommend going here!

e' un ottimo posto dove pranzare a mezzo giorno. la trattoria offre un servizio a costo fisso di un costo di 10 euro a menu. primo, secondo e contorno. l'unico difetto e che il locale è un po' piccolo di dimensione. dovrebbero ingrandirlo .
As part of my journey to enjoy all of Central Texas' best BBQ I went to Whup's. The most important thing is that the food is amazing. The "link" not the sausage was incredible. Absolutely one of the best pieces of meat I have ever had. The ribs were also exceptional. High quality meat smoked just right. The brisket was a touch dry and the sausage was simply average. The sauce and sides left us wanting. We tried them all, but nothing was signature or a stand out. The sauce was thin and necessary for the brisket, but an insult to the excellent other smoked meats. Also note this was not in the most developed of towns. Marlin is a bit run down especially in the part of town by the establishment. I recommend sticking to the main roads. Also there isn't much seating nor is eating at the establishment very desirable. My group - being a group of lawyers - decided to enjoy our food picnic style in front of the Falls County courthouse, in "downtown" Marlin. It made for picturesque eating. This was preferred after we find the local city park generally less appealing than the historic county courthouse and its surrounding statues, etc. It seems the locals call their orders in and almost exclusively do take out. We would have been wise to do the same as it took about 10 minutes to prepare our orders. And 10 minutes if waiting in the Texas summer heat can feel like an eternity. In conclusion, for the meat alone it is with the trip. So if you find yourself in Central Texas, especially in Marlin check out Whup's.
Indeed, the best coffee in London is served here. This place was showed to me couple of months ago and since then I am a common visitor.
Good food at an excellent price

We like Toms Pizza. We like to go and play the games when we are in a mood, get a pitcher and enjoy some pepperoni pizza and laugh. Great example of a long standing Fortuna business.
Fantastic Burritos and from what Im told by my Cali/San Diego friends. THE REAL deal. The san diego burrito is what you would order is cali as the "Carne Asada Burrito" and they also make Carne Asada Fries!!! Everything is soooo good, you really cant go wrong with anything you pick. The owner i believe is the odler gentlemen that is always there, he is super friendly and makes sure you get what you want and even does special request burritos if he has the ingredients!
When we want to eat a good meal in town, Natasha's is always the place to go. I've spent most of my life living in various cities around the world, and grew up in the culinary capitol of Montreal, Canada, so I know a little something about good food. Natasha's consistently produces meals that range from decently enjoyable to delightfully delicious, better than most any comparably priced restaurant in the Big City. Her deserts, also, are to die for. I hope they stay in business a very long time.

Had a great experience with the dealership when purchasing my new 2013 Elantra, awesome vehicle... In fact, my partner loved the car so much he went and bought him one as well! The only thing I have bad to say about the dealership is the Service Department, which in my opinion is very poorly staffed and not reliable at all... The management either needs to be replaced, or train your folks a little better to deal with customer service! What should have taken a little over an hour turned into 5 hours, was not at all pleased. I have seen other bad reviews on the service department which should tell them something? Hope it improves as I do like the dealership and would like to continue to bring our cars in when service is required. Thanks.
I stood in this Hotel for a while. Very Pleasant, quiet and clean.

The cheapest good place in Dubai
I was in DC on business and my dining partner had purchased a groupon for $69. Curious, I read some of the recent reviews ahead of time, which made me play close attention. Here is what I found: the service was excellent - our waiter was well informed about the menu items and made helpful suggestions. He was attentive without being pushy. All (!) items on the menu were available to us, including the higher-priced items, so we ended up with a huge discount. I found the quality of the food to be superb and the portion sizes huge, particularly the appetizers. The desert was to die for, which was a great way top of a wonderful dining experience. I would definitely come here again, though I must say that the prices are quite high, particularly for someone from the middle of the country. If you can expense it, more power to you.
With the service of quality food, AD'S is a good place for hangout, parties and family outings..
The food is simply amazing, the service, however, seems to usually be mediocre and normal at best.

They had a hard to find connection I was looking for. The gentleman behind the counter was very knowledgeable and helped me pick out a soldering iron. Prices were also very reasonable. A great place to do business, I will certainly visit again.
Was there from 1967 to 1970 from class 9 to 11 One of the best times, dedicated teachers and students. We still had time for sports apart from studies. The school used to be opposite Annapurna, old MP school compound. I was in the first batch to pass out from there, We were 3 boys and 2 girls in that batch, imagine now.
Cadre sympa, tarifs corrects et produits frais? Je le pense. On reviendra certainement.
-Paintballing here is the cheapest around, and for the most part they have a great field. (The staff upkeep's the paintball equipment very well.) I would recommend paintballing here. -Go-karting here is decent, the course is great but choose wisely with the carts. some are slow as hell. -Mini-Golf here is decent, the course is a bit run down but it functions well. -Arcade here sucks dick, easiest way to put it. (half the machines are not working and the other half that do most of them eat tokens.) -The haunted walks here on Halloween are pretty cool too. For the most part I only come here for paintball with my cousins or haunted walk with friends. Maybe a couple cart rides but that's about it.
great food dont be in a hurry your gonna be there awhile BECAUSE EVERYONES THERE it takes a while to get your food because alot of people eat there other than that its good food
This restaurant is one of the longest surviving in SOHO. That is quite something - if your food is not good you do not last for more than 13 years in the same spot! Sole Mio is known for the freshly baked bread, roasted fresh garlic and freshly grated Parmesan cheese served when you sit down. The Pizzas are paper thin - just as I like it and the risotto is creamy and excellent. The new revised lasagne recipe is to die for! The most amazing characteristic is how accommodating Sole Mio is - I often request angelhair (capellini) with Fresh pesto - and although not on the menu - owner In Gurung goes out of his way to please. Arabiata and Putenesca .... you ask for any pasta cooked to perfection - you can have any sauce. This restaurant has become a legend and I ALWAYS go back. If you have not tasted the freshly made Tiramisu - you have not tasted heaven.... On a scale of 1 to 10 - I give Sole Mio a 12!!
Vry good clg
I love my permanent eye makeup Cristianne did a great job. However, it was more painful then they claim and on my touch up it didn't go as well. My eye was hurting for hours not my eye lid it was just tender and sore but my actual left eye was watering for hours and it felt like something was in my eye. I waited it out as she suggested but ended up in the ER after hours. There I found out I had a quarter inch scratch on my eye. They gave me special drops but I had to put in my eye every 15 min or the pain would come back. It was not too fun made it hard to sleep. This went on for 48 hrs and my eye took a full week to heal and I ended up with a $800 dollar bill from ER however its been reduced to $300 after insurance but it was frustrating.
Pleasant staff and good instructors. Although it may be a shooting grounds the area is quite peaceful as all rifles have silencers attached. Good place to go to have a fun day with friends!

University of the Punjab Lahore is the oldest and largest public sector university in Pakistan. It is the largest university of the Asia by area. It was formally established in 1882 by British colonial authorities. The university has five campuses in the country, the largest of which is Quid-e-Azam Campus Lahore which is spread over 1800 acres of green landscape. This campus, being the most active and central role in academic activities of the university, is the main target of the students from every corner of the country. The other campuses are Allam Iqbal Campus Lahore, Gujranwala Campus, Jhelum Campus and Khanspur Campus. There are 13 faculties in all these campuses, over 63 departments and over 500 affiliated colleges. The university has over 730 permanent faculty members and over 30,000 students enrolled in various disciplines. The university is providing the students from far of places with quality education on affordable fee. The neat and clean carpeted roads with green trees and plants along present a charming sight to the visitors. The university has six play grounds for hostel-lied students. Beside this, every institute has its own play ground for local games and sports competitions. There are cultural days, sports galas, and variety of gatherings like welcome party, farewell party, speech competitions, and debates etc which are tradition of this university. The university has various scholars of international repute as its faculty members. It produced the scholars and the figures of high competence that have famed its name in the world. Cheap and quality accommodations have been provided to the students of far off regions in order to facilitate their stay in Lahore for study.

The students enjoy a delightful walk in the evening in groups and have fun and gupshup. The hostel life brings about many charms and intimacies among the students. This life is really memorable for the students. There is a Students’ Shopping Centre in the mid of the hostel area. This is the only place where students can buy almost every necessity of theirs. This centre has almost 12 shops with two barber shops. The underpass links between academic departments and accommodations are also desirable infrastructure for the students. The students enjoy their walk through these underpasses towards their institutions. There are four overhead bridges over the canal and road passing between the academic departments and hostel area. The main library of the university is located quite in center and near the hostels. The library remains open till evening so that the hotel-lied students may visit it for their educational needs.
Go to karaoke night. They have the most AMAZING catalog of music ever (i.e. The Freakazoid Theme, Joy Division, Misfits). You owe it to yourself to experience this.
I've been going to this place for a while now. I really enjoy their burritos and the menudo on the weekends is a perfect hangover remedy.

food is good but the decor is minimal
I had the green curry. Just the right amount of heat. This is one of those "hole-in-the-wall" places you love to find when you just want great flavor for not much money.
My favorite place in Baltimore for Chinese food. The food is delicious. The service is good. They deliver. Never had a problem. Only down side is that they only take cash.
Great after hours spot. If you arent into house music and late night clubs, dont come here lol
Son was being picked on and was brought to the attention of staff and staff did nothing. Then when kid started bullying again my son defended himself and was asked to leave .
Love their salads , forgot it was Mexican food. I moved to Augusta 2 1/2 yrs. Ago . So I was glad to find them . I eat there at lease twice a week . The staff is super great always very nice. Some know me when I come in and make me feel special . Keep up the great customer service guys. Thank u. From Ms. Teri (Savannah ).
High quality ingredients and nice service even during busy summer nights. I haven't tried the pizza, but fish courses and home made pasta seem to be their forte. Don't miss the ricotta cake :-)
美式芝士蛋糕應該是最大的亮點，是目前貴陽市內咖啡館中最好吃的芝士蛋糕，當然能做芝士蛋糕的也不多。至於貴陽的那些蛋糕店就不拿出來丟人現眼了，能比較的是附進喜來登酒店的芝士蛋糕，口味都很好，價位也差不多。目前貴陽只此兩家，我認為。 咖啡館分吸煙區和無煙區，估計是目前貴陽唯一的一家吧。吸煙的人用玻璃罩著，悶在裡面吸，很好，最欣賞這一點。 咖啡不比星巴克的便宜，胃不好也不愛喝，一般都喝奶茶。 咖啡館的座位要不就是硬硬的椅子，要不就是軟軟的沙發。每次去坐椅子太硬，坐沙發兩對面間距又太遠，小聲又聽不見，大聲又喧嘩，說話很費勁，本來到咖啡館就是聊天，但是聊得卻不是很舒服，這是我最不喜歡的一點。
Good Store with lots of items Decent prices
Dependable, knowledgable and competitively priced service. We have used S&R for many years and have been completely satisfied. We depend on computers to operate our business and Rick at S&R have been excellent business partners.
Buying a car is never the most fun experience in the world, let's be honest. The process can be lengthy and high pressure. I have to say, I was very happy with the service Carl provided. Carl was courteous and didn't pressure us in to anything. Carl did a good job at planning to keep the process moving along the best he could on a busy day. I appreciate management's frankness about where they were and where i wanted to be. I would recommend Carl to friends and family who are in the market for a vehicle.
Food was good and prices were ok. Service was kinda slow but staff were friendly. I just love their outdoor patio, it's so unexpectedly charming and bohemian. A perfect spot in the summer. This would be a beautiful location for an outdoor reception.

First time at Vito's. Wonder way we waited so long. Our take out large pizza was most excellent. Great crust, tasty sauce & cheese with very pleasing spices. I think we found a new home for pie.

Puff is the best
Awesome teriyaki
Absolutely fantastic, the coffee is great. the atmosphere is brilliant and the staff are fab. One problem is the queuing time is rather long, but it's understandable considering the taste of their amazing coffee.
Great Boilermakers, chill atmosphere. Through the bookcase to dimly-lit fun!
I've been to this place a grand total of four times. Each time I leave telling myself I am never coming back. And yet I seem to find myself there at least once a year. The majority of reviewers have hit the nail right on the head. The store itself is worth checking out. An excellent selection of comics, action figures, some sports cards, a decent amount of video games and a small amount of dvds and records can be found. The previous comment about organization is correct. There seems to be some attempt at grouping, but if your hoping for some type of coherent filing system, go elsewhere. If you don't mind rummaging through piles of interesting crap, dig in! I've spent hours just wandering around the place and still felt like I didn't see everything. The big draw back is indeed the customer service. I am a very respectful person. During my visits, I always keep to myself and only bother the staff when I am paying or when I want something that they've locked in a case. You would think this would keep me relatively safe from their scorn. Wrong. The first time I stepped foot in the place they made some sideways comment about the shirt I was wearing. Didn't bother to greet me, simply cracked wise about my clothes. Whatever, I brushed it off. I'm sure he might be a decent person outside of the store, but at work, the owner is a jerk. No professionalism, not at all friendly and at times, downright abusive to customers. I agree with the previous comment about the other employees. While not abusive like the boss, it's pretty clear they don't give a rip. My advice, check this place out at least once, but unless you enjoy dealing with service that ranges from confrontational and abrasive on a bad day to dismissive on a good day, keep to yourself.

The customer service at Extra Space Storage on U St in DC was GREAT! The facility was clean. I was there on behalf of my company. Since it was my first time there I asked Edmund if he could walk me to the unit then to the shred truck that I had to meet. On our way there I know I talked Edmond's ear off but he didn't seem to mind at all. LoL He was professional, polite, and very helpful. Thank you for your GREAT customer service Edmund! I recommend this place to everyone.
Bon resto nous y allons souvent :)
nice disco, great staff, good food
We got our 6 month old puppy there about 3.5 months ago. He is a Pit/Lab mix and just an awesome animal. We live in a rental and they did check out with our landlord and ask a lot more questions about us and our past. Gauss is a huge part of our family and we are so happy that we found him and they let us have to time to get to know him before we got him. We previously adopted two cats there, Pixel and Bit as 7 week old kittens who had been abandoned. They were both sick, which they had let us know about and also explained that it would be easier to recover in a home. We were really nervous about Bit, who would not eat or drink and they walked us through the process of caring for them. They are both healthy and loving animals. The vats have also been great, they all remember him and our two cats. They do care about the animals and it is sad to see the state of some of the animals that go into the vet clinic. It is just hard to get in for an appointment sometimes and they don't always run on time due to the amount of animals they have to serve... hence the very good instead of excellent.
I had not been here since I was a kid. I was pleasantly surprised to have dinner here today and found that it was still a good place to eat. Many pancake-style restaurants in my area have simply gone down-hill over the years. Though the decor may not have seen an update in a while, the staff was wonderful and the food was tasty. The portions are easily enough for two people and the menu is HUGE. They serve breakfast (all day), lunch and dinner, anything from American, Greek, to Mexican inspired foods. Not many healthy options/alternatives, but its a great place for good standard meals.
Good local spot catering to the snowboarder. If you're used to Mammoth or Big Bear don't get your hopes up... But still a great place to have fun with your friends

I wanted power cleaning for the patio in the back yard and the guys did an outstanding job. Everything was done as I wanted it. Excellent!

Beautiful.
We haven't had any problems with public storage, the facility is under climate-control and access is easy and straight forward. We wish that we didn't get such an inconvenient location though, seeing that so many other locations were available and closer to the elevator. The first month was $1 but we were also responsible for a lot of hidden charges. Overall, the price was fair, the facility is safe, and we liked the location (close to the colleges).
